The truth is radically different. Bolstered by new manufacturing techniques and ecological benefits, wood has seen a fabulous resurgence in contemporary construction.</p><p>This Bibliotheca Universalis edition explores how architects around the world have created and invented with this elementary material. Featuring follies, very large buildings, and ambitious urban renewal schemes, it celebrates the diverse deployment of wood by architects around the world. We see how wood can at once transform urban spaces, as in the Metropol Parasol in Seville by J�rgen Mayer H., and allow for sensitive interventions in natural environments, such as at the Termas Geom�tricas Hot Springs Complex in Puc�n, Chile, by Germ�n del Sol.</p><p>True to all TASCHEN architecture titles, the book pays tribute to many emerging international talents as well as to such renowned figures as Tadao Ando and Renzo Piano. It celebrates each architect&#x2019;s vision and innovation, as well as investigating the techniques, trends, and principles that have informed their work with wood. It examines the computer-guided milling that has allowed for novel new forms, the responsible harvesting that allows wood to align with our environmental concerns, and, above all, wood&#x2019;s enduring appeal to our senses and psyche, comforting hectic modern lives with a sense of Arcadian simplicity.</p></p><p>Philip Jodidio a �tudi� l&#39;histoire de l&#39;art et l&#39;�conomie � l&#39;universit� Harvard et a �t� r�dacteur en chef du magazine Connaissance des Arts pendant plus de vingt ans.

They would decorate the sharp spires with colorful gumdrops for the children to enjoy. THE GUMDROP TREE is the story of a young girl who wanted to find the tallest, fattest, most beautiful Christmas tree of anyone in her town. It had to be very special. In this tale, Susie takes a long time to pick out the perfect tree for her family. After the tree stands in the corner with its shinny decorations, her mother sends her next door with a food basket for an elderly neighbor. Susie is very reluctant to leave her beautiful tree. Upon arriving at the neighbor's house, Susie discovers the scraggly branch that that Miss Martha calls her Christmas tree. On her way home, she tries to figure out what she can do so that the elderly lady can have a colorful tree. THE GUMDROP TREE is written for children from the age of 4 to 13. It teaches that sometimes it does not take the tallest, fattest, most beautifully decorated Christmas tree to be special.</p></p><p></p><h2>Basic Principles in Pianoforte Playing (Dover Books On Music: Piano)</h2><p><p>This little book, written at the height of his career by Josef Lhevinne, the "inward poet of the piano," is a clear statement of principles based on his lifelong experience in performance and teaching. Lhevinne was, with Rachmaninoff, Schnabel, and Hoffman, one of the great modern masters, and was the first artist invited to teach at the newly formed Julliard Graduate School of Music.<br>Technique, through essential, must be subordinate to musical understanding. Complete knowledge of scales, apprehended not mechanically but musically; understanding of the uses of rests and silence, which Mozart considered the greatest effect in music; a feeling for rhythm and training of the ear; these are the basic elements of a thorough grounding in musicianship and are accordingly emphasized in the opening chapters.<br>The heart of the book is devoted to the attainment of a beautiful tone. Anyone who has heard Lhevinne play or has listened to one of his recordings will know how great were his achievements in that area. The secret lay, at least in part, in the technique he called "the arm floating in air," and in the use of the wrists as natural shock absorbers. The achievement of varieties of tone, of the singing, ringing tone, of brilliancy, of delicacy, and of power are all explained in terms of a careful analysis of the ways in which the fingers, hand, wrist, arm, and indeed the whole body function in striking the keys. There are further remarks about how to get a clear staccato and an unblurred legato, about the dangers of undue emphasis on memorization and the need for variety in practicing, and special comments on the use of the pedal, which should be employed with as much precision as the keys.<br>Throughout, specific musical examples are presented as illustrations. The author draws not only upon his own experiences and methods, but upon the examples of Anton Rubenstein and of his teacher, Safonoff, for this remarkably lucid and concise formulation of basic principles.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Getting Libertarianism Right</h2><p>Useful as a brief statement of where Hoppe stands on the most important issues within the libertrarian movement &#x2014; and the most important issues of our age. Some regard Hoppe as the greatest living libertarian, others as the devil. The only point of agreement is that he is a thinker who cannot be ignored.</p><p></p><h2>Tell Me a Riddle, Requa I, and Other Works</h2><p><p>A century after her birth, Tillie Olsen&#x2019;s writing is as relevant as when it first appeared; indeed, the clarity and passion of her vision and style have, if anything, become even more striking over time. Collected here for the first time are several of Olsen&#x2019;s nonfiction pieces about the 1930s, early journalism pieces, and short fiction, including the four beautifully crafted, highly celebrated stories originally published as <i>Tell Me a Riddle</i>: &#x201c;I Stand Here Ironing,&#x201d; &#x201c;Hey Sailor, What Ship?,&#x201d; &#x201c;O Yes,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Tell Me a Riddle.&#x201d; Also included, for the first time since it appeared in the 1971 Best American Short Stories, is &#x201c;Requa I.&#x201d;</p><p>In these stories, as in all of her work, Olsen set a new standard for the treatment of women and the poor and for the depiction of their lives and circumstances. In her hands, the hard truths about motherhood and marriage, domestic life, labor, and political conviction found expression in language of such poetic intensity and depth that their&nbsp;influence continues to be felt today.</p><p>An introduction by Olsen&#x2019;s granddaughter, the poet Rebekah Edwards, and a foreword by her daughter Laurie Olsen provide a personal and generational context for the author&#x2019;s work.</p></p><p><p>Tillie Olsen (1912&#x2013;2007) was an activist, feminist, award-winning author, and teacher who won nine honorary degrees and whose short stories &#x201c;Tell Me a Riddle&#x201d; (winner of the O. Henry Award) and &#x201c;I Stand Here Ironing&#x201d; have been anthologized extensively. She is the author of the novel <i>Yonondio: From the Thirties</i>, available in a Bison Books edition, the nonfiction book <i>Silences</i>, and numerous published essays and is the editor of <i>Mother to Daughter, Daughter to Mother: Mothers on Mothering</i>. <br></p>"An excellent volume that will appeal to anyone interested in women's studies, social justice, journalism, and American short stories and fiction."&#x2014;Erica Swenson, <i>Library Journal </i> (Erica Swenson <i>Library Journal</i> 2013-10-15)<br><br>"Even a century later, Olsen's writing is brilliantly measured and rich in character&#x2014;a blend that few writers achieve. Coupled with essays by her daughters and granddaughter, Olsen's newest collection is a must-have for any reader."&#x2014;<i>Portland Book Review</i> (<i>Portland Book Review</i> 2014-02-25)</p><h2>Psoas Strength and Flexibility: Core Workouts to Increase Mobility, Reduce Injuries and End Back Pain</h2><p><strong>A COMPLETE GUIDE TO PREVENTING BACK AND HIP INJURIES BY STRENGTHENING THE MUSCLE GROUP CONNECTING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BODY</strong><br><br>Connecting the lower spine to the hips and legs, a strong and flexible psoas muscle is vital for everyday movements like walking, bending and reaching, as well as athletic endeavors like jumping for a ball, holding a yoga pose and swinging a golf club.

It is compulsively readable, in part the consequence of a lucid style and apt choice of detail, but mainly the result of a masterly overall grasp, acute judgment, fresh insight, and a compelling sense of immediacy that fully justifies the author's preference for a predominantly narrative approach.

Now, the future has become the present: Dr. Gero has unleashed his creations, Androids #19 and #20, to get revenge against Goku for defeating the Red Ribbon Army! But even three years of advance warning may not be enough to prepare the heroes to face robots more powerful than Super Saiyans! And when Trunks returns to join in the fight, they discover that time travel can be dangerous...because sometimes the future changes in ways you don&#39;t expect...</p><p>Akira Toriyama&#39;s first weekly series, Dr. Slump, has entertained generations of readers in Japan since it was introduced in Shueisha&#39;s Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in 1980. A few years later, he created his wildly popular Dragon Ball series, which brought him international success. Toriyama is also known for his character designs for video games, including Dragon Warrior, Chrono Trigger and Tobal No. 1.</p><h2>Mind over Labor: A Breakthrough Guide to Giving Birth (Penguin Handbooks)</h2><p>The fear and pain most women expect from pregnancy can at last be overcome. Carl Jones, a certified childbirth educator, tells how using mental imagery can help you reduce the pain of labor by controlling the fear beforehand. His easy-to-follow, eight-step method, which teaches your mind to cooperate with your body, will help make your childbirth less stressful and more natural. Whether you plan to give birth at home, in a childbearing center, or in a hospital, Carl Jones's simple exercises will put you in touch with the best instrument of birth there is&#x2014;yourself.</p><p>"This book will show you how to create the kind of birth you want," writes Jones, author of After the Baby Is Born, etc. He compares childbirth to lovemaking in terms of the potential joy for the woman and claims that the key to a "safe, happy birth" is mental imagerythe art of creating vivid pictures in the mind to help the woman "surrender" to the "pleasure" of childbirth. Mental-imagery exercises include thinking of a "Special Place," such as a favorite beach, or envisioning the child in the womb and asking "what he or she needs." Jones stresses the importance of a mellow labor environment and subtly promotes the idea of delivery at home or in a childbearing center, but he fails to spell out the risks of a nonhospital delivery. His goal of a well-informed, positive-thinking pregnant couple is admirable, but his insistence that attitude can overcome virtually any problem is questionable. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American Girl: Ultimate Visual Guide: A Celebration of the American Girl� Story</h2><p><p>Explore 30 years of American Girl� from the BeForever&#x2122; characters like Samantha and Melody, all of the Girl of the Year&#x2122; line including Lea, and the variety of the TrulyMe&#x2122; dolls.</p><p><i>American Girl: Ultimate Visual Guide</i> will be a treasured addition to every American Girl fan's bookshelf, with beautiful imagery and enlightening facts and information about the complete line of American Girl dolls.

Taking familiar biblical stories from the Old and New Testaments and placing them side by side, children can see biblical typology jump off the page. Biblical typology is when a person or an event in the Old Testament foreshadows a person or an event in the New Testament. The Bible is full of these fascinating "types." Children can now discover similarities of types without any difficulty, and easily understand at an early age what St. Augustine meant when he said that the New Testament lies hidden in the Old and the Old Testament is revealed in the New.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommended for ages 7 and up.</p></p><p></p><h2>FLASH!: Writing the Very Short Story</h2><p><p><strong>An engaging and frank guide to writing the very short story, full of sound advice, exemplary models, and provocative exercises.</strong></p> The history of fiction has been dominated by the novel and the short story.

Day founded the Lazy B ranch, where U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and her brother Alan spent their youth, a time they recall in this affectionate joint memoir.<p> "We belonged to the Lazy B, and it belonged to each of us," write O'Connor and Day. "We thought it would always be there." Weathering events from the Great Depression to cyclical drought, they worked the ranch's 300 square miles alongside a colorful crew of cowboys, learning the ways of cattle, horses, and people, lessons they share in well-turned anecdotes. They also learned a system of values that "was simple and unsophisticated and the product of necessity," one that has followed them into the larger world.

Like all his writing, these essays are seasoned by a keen sense of observation and a deep knowledge and love of fishing lore, leavened by a wonderfully wry sense of humor. Gierach often begins with an observation that soon leads to something below the surface, which he finds and successfully lands. As Gierach says, writing is a lot like fishing.<br> <br>This is the first anthology of John Gierach&#x2019;s work, a collection that is sure to delight both die-hard fans and new readers alike. To enter Gierach&#x2019;s world is to experience the daily wonder, challenge, and occasional absurdity of the fishing life&#x2014;from such rituals as the preparation of camp coffee (for best results, serve in a tin cup) to the random, revelatory surprises, such as the flashing beauty of a grayling leaping out of the water. Whether he&#x2019;s catching fish or musing on the ones that got away, Gierach is always entertaining and enlightening, writing with his own inimitable blend of grace and style, passion and wit.</p><p>There are two things no dedicated fly-fisher can really have enough of: a decent selection of flies on the stream and a decent selection of John Gierach off of it. <i>Death, Taxes, and Leaky Waders</i> should go a good way toward satisfying the latter. In this "greatest hits" of essays culled from Gierach's previous collections, the genial wit and astute observer behind <i>Another Lousy Day in Paradise</i>, <i>Dances with Trout</i>, and <i>Trout Bum</i> reels in 40 of his favorite keepers. Considering the quality of Gierach's writing, calling <i>Headwaters</i> a "treasury" is no fish tale at all.<p> Reading <i>Leaky Waders</i> is like recalling some memorably productive afternoons on the stream with an old fishing buddy. Writing about his sport and his adventures, Gierach is naturally writing about much more: "I've always tried to figure out what a story is about," he'll admit readily. "It's something other than the fishing but that wouldn't have come up <i>without</i> the fishing." As in "The Purist," an essay from <i>The View from Rat Lake</i>: it's vintage Gierach, an excuse to use fishing to open a window onto human nature. "What is it about fly-fishing," he asks, </p><blockquote>that attracts ... those people who must engineer a corner of their lives--sometimes a pretty large corner--where things have to be done properly? I'm not sure I know, but whatever it is, it's why the sport can be used to define the very existence of the practitioner.</blockquote> From there, he connects, with deft precision, the seemingly diverse strands of his own experience as a plumber's helper, a fire on the Cuyahoga River, Zen, a little fishing history, a brief meditation on the dry fly, B.B. King, such noted anglers as G.E.M. Skues and Gierach's own great fishing accomplice A.K. Best, Idaho's Three Rivers Ranch on the Henry's Fork, and a graceful dismissal of snootiness and pretension. It's a skillful performance. Before you're finished with <i>Death, Taxes, and Leaky Waders</i>, you'll find 39 more that are just as good. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>John Gierach is the author of&nbsp;more than twenty books about fly-fishing. His writing has appeared in&nbsp;<i>Field &amp; Stream, Gray&#x2019;s Sporting Journal</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Fly Rod &amp; Reel</i>, where he is a regular columnist. He also writes a column for the monthly&nbsp;<i>Redstone Review</i>.

Hayes: Warrior and President</h2><p>Who was the real Rutherford B. Hayes? Was he a great or inconsequential president? How did his early life and career shape his later years? How did his triumphs and failures alter our history? And why should we care? Ari Hoogenboom's masterful life of Hayes definitively answers those questions and shows why our nineteenth president deserves far greater recognition than he's received in the past.<br><br>The first biography of Hayes in nearly fifty years, Hoogenboom's book recreates the rapidly changing world of Victorian America as experienced by one of its most reflective and perceptive figures. The Hayes that emerges is a much more progressive and far-sighted leader than previously suggested. He was, Hoogenboom argues, neither a Southern sympathizer nor an exemplar of the "Greedy Gilded Age." Rather, he was a devout, pragmatic champion of equal rights.<br><br>Hayes's colorful life was rooted in his frontier experiences in Ohio and galvanized on Civil War battlefields, where he survived five wounds and was ultimately promoted to major general. No other president was under fire on the front lines as much as Hayes.<br><br>Hayes's image as president (1877-1881), however, has not been quite so shining. He has been blamed for Reconstruction's failure and damned for an apparent bargain that guaranteed his election in exchange for withdrawing military support of Republican governments in the South. He has also been criticized for championing the gold standard, for breaking the Great Strike of 1877, for inconsistent support of civil-service reform, and for being an ineffectual politician. <br><br>Hoogenboom contends that these evaluations are largely false. Previous scholars, he says, have failed to appreciate Hayes's limited options and have misrepresented his actions in their depictions of an overly cautious, nonvisionary president. In fact, he was strikingly modern in his efforts to enlarge the power of the office, which he used as his own bully pulpit to rouse public support for his goals. <br><br>Chief among these goals, Hoogenboom shows, was equality for all Americans. Throughout his presidency and long afterwards, Hayes worked steadfastly for reforms that would encourage economic opportunity, distribute wealth more equitably, diminish the conflict between capital and labor, and ultimately enable African-Americans to achieve political equality. Although he fell far short of his ideals, his unwavering commitment deserves our attention and respect.</p><p>"Rutherford B. Hayes was an important president who has long deserved a full modern treatment of his career. Ari Hoogenboom's well-researched, engrossing, and multi-faceted account of Hayes's life as a soldier and politician is a significant contribution to the historical literature on the American presidency. It is also a first-rate example of political biography at its best."--Lewis L. Gould, author of <i>The Presidency of William McKinley</i> and <i>The Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt</i> <p>"From antislavery lawyer to Union general and Republican politician, Hayes's career was intertwined with the major issues of slavery, war, and reunion. As president he struggled with the issues of Reconstruction and the emerging industrial order, always seeking to do the right thing; as an ex-president, he endeavored to preserve the past and prepare for the future. In this comprehensive biography, Hoogenboom rescues Hayes from undeserved obscurity and tells us much not only about the man but also about the times in which he lived. Hoogenboom's skilled rendering of the life of the nineteenth president promises to be definitive, restoring Hayes to his rightful place in American history as a representative of his era."--Brooks Simpson, author of <i>Let Us Have Peace: Ulysses S. Grant and the Politics of War and Reconstruction, 1861-1868</i> </p><p>"Compels fresh respect for both the man and his times."--Allan Peskin, author of <i>Garfield</i> </p><p>"An exceptional study: revisionist, comprehensive, and, to a surprising extent, relevant.

An immortal who'd lived most of his long life as a soldier, waging battle, didn't turn from a fight with a god. A soldier, though a loner by nature, understood the duty, and loyalty, to those who battled with him.<br><br>The man, the soldier, the loner who'd seen his young brother destroyed by black magick, who'd had his own life upended by it, who fought a god's crazed greed, knew the difference between the dark and the light.<br><br>Being propelled through space by a fellow soldier, a shifter, while they were all still bloody from the battle didn't frighten him-but he'd have preferred any other mode of transportation.<br><br>Through the whirl of wind, the blare of light, the breathless speed (and all right then, there was a bit of a thrill in the speed), he felt his companions. The sorcerer who held more power than any Doyle had known in all his years. The woman who was as much the glue who bound them together as a seer. The mermaid who was all charm and courage and heart-and a pure pleasure for the eyes. The shifter, loyal and brave, and a dead shot as well. And the female-well, wolf now, as the moon had risen just as they'd prepared to shift from the beauty and battles of Capri.<br><br>She howled-no other term for it-and in the sound of it he heard not fear, no, but the same atavistic thrill that beat in his own blood.<br><br>If a man had to align himself with others, had to throw his fate in with others, he could do a hell of a lot worse than these.<br><br>Then he smelled Ireland-the damp air, the green-and the thrill died in him. The fates, canny and cold, would drive him back here where his heart and his life had been broken.<br><br>Even as he geared himself up to deal with it, to do what must be done, they dropped like stones.<br><br>A man who couldn't die could still feel the jolt and insult of hitting the ground hard enough to rattle bones and steal the breath.<br><br>"Bloody hell, Sawyer."<br><br>"Sorry." Sawyer's voice came from his left, and in a kind of gasping wheeze. "It's a lot to navigate. Anybody hurt? Annika?"<br><br>"I'm not hurt. But you." Her voice was a musical croon. "You're hurt. You're weak."<br><br>"Not too bad. You're bleeding."<br><br>Bright as sunlight, she smiled. "Not too bad."<br><br>"Maybe we should try parachutes next time." Sasha let out a quick moan.<br><br>"There now, I've got you."<br><br>As his eyes adjusted, Doyle saw Bran shift, gather Sasha close.<br><br>"You're hurt?"<br><br>"No, no." Sasha shook her head. "Cuts and bumps. And the landing knocked the wind out of me. I should be used to it. Riley? Where's Riley?"<br><br>Doyle rolled, started to push himself up-and pressed a hand into fur. It growled.<br><br>"She's here." He shifted his gaze, met those tawny eyes. Dr. Riley Gwin, renowned archaeologist-and lycan. "Don't so much as think of biting me," he muttered. "She's fine. Like she tells us, she heals fast in wolf form."<br><br>He got to his feet, noted that however rough the landing, Sawyer had come through. Weapons cases, luggage, sealed boxes of research books, maps, and other essentials lay in a somewhat orderly pile a few feet away on the cool, damp grass.<br><br>And of great personal importance to him, his motorcycle stood, upright and undamaged.<br><br>Satisfied, he stretched out a hand to Sawyer, pulled the man to his feet.<br><br>"Not altogether bad."<br><br>"Yeah." Sawyer combed his fingers through his mane of windswept, sun-streaked hair. Then grinned when Annika did a series of cartwheels. "Somebody enjoyed the ride anyway."<br><br>"You did well." Bran dropped a hand on Sawyer's shoulder. "It's a feat, isn't it, juggling six people and all the rest across the sea and sky in, well, a matter of minutes."<br><br>"Got one bitch of a headache out of it."<br><br>"And more."<br><br>Bran lifted Sawyer's hand-the one that had gripped Nerezza's flying hair while he'd shifted her away. "We'll fix that, and anything else needs fixing. We should get Sasha inside. She's a bit shaky."<br><br>"I'm all right." But she remained sitting on the ground. "Just a little dizzy. Please don't," she said quickly, and pushed to her knees toward Riley. "Not yet. Let's just get oriented first. She wants to run," she told the others.<br><br>"She'll be fine. There's no harm here." Bran helped Sasha up. "The woods are mine," he said to Riley. "And now they're yours."<br><br>The wolf turned, bounded away, vanished into the thick trees.<br><br>"She could get lost," Sasha began.<br><br>"She's a wolf," Doyle pointed out. "And likely to find her way around better than the rest of us. She changed, but as we were leaving, and needs her moment. Wolf or woman, she can handle herself."<br><br>He turned his back on the woods where he'd run tame as a child, where he'd hunted, where he'd gone for solitude. This had been his land once, his home-and now it was Bran's.<br><br>Yes, the fates were canny and cold.<br><br>In the house Bran had built on the wild coast of Clare, Doyle could see the memory of his own. Where his family had lived for generations.<br><br>Gone, he reminded himself, centuries ago. The house and the family, gone to dust.<br><br>In its place was the grand, and he'd have expected no less from Bran Killian.<br><br>A fine manor, Doyle mused, with the fanciful touches one might expect from a wizard. Stone-perhaps some of it from the walls of that long-ago home-rising a full three stories, with those fanciful touches in two round towers on either side, and a kind of central parapet that would offer mad views of the cliffs, of the sea, of the land.<br><br>All softened, Doyle supposed would be the word, with gardens fit for the faeries, blooming wild and free, with the mixed perfumes blown about on the windy air.<br><br>Doyle indulged himself for one moment, allowed himself to think of his own mother and how she'd have loved every bit of it.<br><br>Then he put it away.<br><br>"It's a fine house."<br><br>"It's good land. And as I said to Riley, it's yours as much as mine. Well, that's my feeling on it," Bran added when Doyle shook his head.<br><br>"We've come together," Bran continued as the wind tossed his hair, black as the night, around his sharp-boned face. "Were thrown together for a purpose. We've fought and bled together, and no doubt will again. And here we are, standing on where you sprang from, and where I was compelled to build. There's purpose in that as well, and we'll use it."<br><br>In comfort, Annika ran her hand down Doyle's arm. Her long black hair was a sexy tangle from the shift. She had bruises on her remarkable face. "It's beautiful. I can smell the sea. I can hear it."<br><br>"It's a ways down." Bran smiled at her. "But you'll make your way to it easy enough, I wager. In the morning, you'll see more of what it offers. For now, we'd best haul all of our things inside, and settle in a bit."<br><br>"I hear that." Sawyer reached down, hefted some boxes. "And, God, I could eat."<br><br>"I'll make food!" Annika threw her arms around him, kissed him enthusiastically, then picked up her bag. "Is there food to make, Bran? Food I can make while you tend the wounds?"<br><br>"I had the kitchen well stocked." He flicked his fingers at the big, arched double doors. "The house is unlocked."<br><br>"As long as there's beer." Doyle grabbed two weapon cases-his own priority-and started in behind Annika and Sawyer.<br><br>"It hurts him," Sasha quietly told Bran. "I can feel the ache in him, the ache of memories and loss."<br><br>"And I'm sorry for it, truly. But we all know there's a reason for it, why it's here that we've been led to find the last star and end this."<br><br>"Because there's always a price." On a sigh, she leaned against him, closed eyes blue as summer and still hollow from the battle and the shift. "But Annika's right. It's a beautiful house. It's stunning, Bran. I'll want to paint it a dozen times."<br><br>"You'll have time for dozens of dozens." He turned her to him. "I said it was Doyle's and Riley's as it's mine. It's Annika's and Sawyer's as well. But, f&#x2021;idh, it's yours as my heart is yours. Will you live with me here, at least some of the time in our lives together?"<br><br>"I'll live with you here, and anywhere. But now? I should take a look inside and see if it's as wonderful as the outside."<br><br>"It's a true home now that you're here." To dazzle her, he waved a hand. All the windows illuminated. Glowing lights shimmered along garden paths.<br><br>"You take my breath." She sighed it, then picked up the case holding most of her art supplies-her priority.<br><br>They went inside, into a wide entryway with towering ceilings where wide-planked floors gleamed. A heavy table with curled dragons for its legs held crystal balls and a tall vase bursting with white roses.<br><br>It opened to a living area with jewel-tone sofas, more heavy tables, sparkling lamps. And with another wave of the hand, Bran had red-gold flames erupting in a stone fireplace so large the muscular Doyle could have stood upright, arms stretched to either side.<br><br>As he walked in from the back, Doyle raised an eyebrow, toasted with the beer in his hand. "You went for posh, brother."<br><br>"I suppose I did."<br><br>"I'll get more if you'll see to Sawyer. His headache's real enough. I can see it on him. And he's carrying some ugly burns. Annika's hurt more than she lets on."<br><br>"Help Sawyer and Annika," Sasha said. "I'll help Doyle."<br><br>"He's in the kitchen with Annika." Doyle glanced at Sasha. "I can handle bringing in the rest. You've got your own battle scars, Blondie."<br><br>"Nothing major. I'm fine," she told Bran. "The dizziness only lasted a couple minutes this time, and the rest can wait. I could use a glass of wine if you have it."<br><br>"I do, of course. Let me see to him, then I'll help you with the rest."<br><br>She walked outside with Doyle, started to pick up more bags, then just stared out into the woods.<br><br>"She'll be back once she's run it off." Doyle took a pull on his beer. "But you'd be happier with all your chicks in the roost."<br><br>Sasha lifted her shoulders, let them fall. "I would. It's been . . . a day."<br><br>"Finding the second star should put a smile in your eyes instead of sorrow."<br><br>"A year ago I was still denying what I was. I knew nothing of any of you, of gods-dark or bright. I'd never harmed anyone, much less . . ."<br><br>"What you fought and killed wasn't anyone. They were things created by Nerezza to destroy."<br><br>"There were people, too, Doyle. Humans."<br><br>"Mercenaries, paid by Malmon to kill us, or worse. Have you forgotten what they did to Sawyer and Annika in the cave?"<br><br>"No." Sasha hugged her arms tight against the quick chill. "I'll never forget. And I'll never understand how human beings could torture and try to kill for money. Why they'd kill or die for profit. But she does, Nerezza does. She knows that kind of greed, that blind lust for power. And I understand that's what we're fighting. Malmon, he traded everything for it. She took his soul, his humanity, and now he's a thing. Her creature. She'd do the same to all of us."<br><br>"But she won't. She won't because we won't give her anything. We hurt her today. She's the one wounded and bleeding tonight. I've searched for the stars, hunted her for more years than you can know. I got close, or thought I did. But close means nothing."<br><br>He took another long pull from his beer. "I don't like using fate or destiny as reasons or excuses, but the hard fact is we six are together, are meant to be. Are meant to find the Stars of Fortune and end Nerezza. You feel more than others. That's your gift, and your curse, to see and to feel. And without that gift we wouldn't be standing here. It doesn't hurt that you can shoot a crossbow as if born with the bow in one hand and a bolt in the other."<br><br>"Who'd have thought?" She sighed, a pretty woman with long, sunwashed hair and deep blue eyes. One who'd gained muscle and strength, inside and out, over the last weeks. "I feel your heartache. I'm sorry."<br><br>"I'll deal with it."<br><br>"I know you were meant to be here, to walk this land again, to look out at this sea. And not just for the quest for the stars, not just for the fight against Nerezza. Maybe-I'm not sure-but maybe it's for solace."<br><br>Doyle shut down-that was survival. "What was here for me was long ago."<br><br>"And still," she murmured, "the coming here tonight is harder on you, and the getting here tonight was hardest on Riley."<br><br>"Considering we'd just fought off a god and her murderous minions, it wasn't a ride on a carousel for any of us. All right," he said at Sasha's quiet look, "rough on her."<br><br>He put the empty beer bottle in the pocket of his scarred leather coat, hauled up suitcases. "She'll run it off, and be back by morning. Grab what you can, and I'll get the rest. We both know you'd be more help to Bran with the injuries."<br><br>She didn't argue, and he noted that she limped a bit. To settle it, he set the bags down inside, plucked her up.<br><br>"Hey."<br><br>"Easier than arguing. Is the house big enough for you?"<br><br>They passed wide archways and the rooms beyond them. Deep, rich colors, simmering fires in hearths, glinting lights, gleaming wood.<br><br>"It's magnificent. It's huge."<br><br>"I'd say the two of you will have to make a lot of babies to fill it."<br><br>"I-"<br><br>"That got you thinking."<br><br>She'd yet to regain speech when he carried her into the kitchen. There, Sawyer, looking a little less pale, sat on a stool at a long slate-gray counter while Bran treated the burns on his hands.<br><br>Annika, who managed to look gorgeous despite the cuts, the bruises, earnestly saut ed chicken in an enormous frying pan at what Sasha recognized as a professional-grade six-burner range.<br><br>"Okay, now you want to-" Sawyer broke off, hissed as Bran hit a fresh point of pain.<br><br>"I take the chicken out, and put the vegetables in. I can do it," Annika insisted. "Let Bran work."<br><br>"I'll help." Sasha poked Doyle in the shoulder.

This book, written by one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on Sparta, traces the rise and fall of Spartan society and explores the tremendous influence the Spartans had on their world and even on ours. Paul Cartledge brings to life figures like legendary founding father Lycurgus and King Leonidas, who embodied the heroism so closely identified with this unique culture, and he shows how Spartan women enjoyed an unusually dominant and powerful role in this hyper-masculine society. Based firmly on original sources, <b>The Spartans</b> is the definitive book about one of the most fascinating cultures of ancient Greece.</p><p><b>Paul Cartledge</b>, professor of Greek history at the University of Cambridge, is the author of&nbsp;<i>Alexander the Great, The Spartans,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization.</i><b>Chapter 1<br><br>UNDER THE SIGN OF LYCURGUS</b><br><br>The image of Sparta as a dour, barracks-like camp hardly prepares the first-time visitor for the glorious spectacle that unfolds as one emerges from the uplands abutting Arcadia to the north and enters down the Eurotas valley into the Spartan plain. Stretching before one are two parallel mountain chains, that of Taygetus on the west reaching to 2,404 metres at the peak, and that of Parnon on the east (1,935 metres at its peak). The alluvial plain itself, and its continuation south in the Eurotas valley that runs out into the sea in the Laconian Gulf, constitute one of the most fertile and desirable pieces of land in all southern Greece. Soil, climate and man conspire to yield and garner sometimes two harvests of grain in a single year. Olives and grapevines, the other two staples of the so-called Mediterranean diet, flourish here too - as of course does the forest of citrus trees, but they are a post-Classical import, reminding us that the terrain and vegetation we see today are not necessarily those enjoyed by the inhabitants of two and a half millennia ago.<br><br>Hardly surprisingly, this region, known in historical times as Lacedaemon, was believed also to have been the seat of a great king in the ancient Greeks' heroic age - what we scholars more prosaically call the Mycenaean or Late Bronze Age (<i>c.</i> 1500-1100 BC). An attempt has been made very recently (see biography of Helen p. 48) to relocate the palace of Homer's Menelaus from Sparta to Pellana further north in Laconia, but that flies in the face not only of ancient legend and religious worship but also of topographical geopolitics. Any real Late Bronze Age Menelaus must have had his palace in or near the site of historical Sparta - perhaps actually where a large settlement, including a building qualifying as a 'mansion', has been scrupulously excavated by the British School at Athens. However, no contemporary palace on the scale of those excavated at Mycenae (seat of Homer's Agamemnon, brother of Menelaus) and Pylos (capital of garrulous old Nestor) has yet come to light in Laconia - and perhaps never will. It is important not to read Homer as a straight history textbook, however archaeologically productive that mistake has undoubtedly been.<br><br>HELEN<br><br>Helen of Troy - or Helen of Sparta? She was, of course, both. A local girl, daughter of Tyndareus, according to one version of her myth, but yet, according to another version, daughter of great father Zeus and born miraculously from an egg because her mother Leda had been visited by Zeus in the disguise of a swan. Her unsurpassed beauty made her a natural prize for the ambitious Menelaus, son of Atreus of Mycenae, whose older son Agamemnon took Helen's sister Clytemnestra for his bride. However, that beauty also captivated an unwelcome visitor to Sparta: Paris, prince of Troy in Asia, overlooking the straits of the Dardanelles, who - aided crucially by the Cyprus-born love goddess Aphrodite - violated the sacred obligations of guest-friendship and robbed Menelaus of his lawfully wedded wife.<br><br>Recently, a Greek archaeologist caused a little stir by claiming that he had located Helen's (and Menelaus') palace, not at Sparta but at Pellana some fifteen kilometres farther north. That claim would have astonished the ancient Spartans, who built a new shrine for Helen in Sparta, or more precisely at Therapne to the south-east of the ancient town, where she received worship along with her husband Menelaus and her divine brothers the Dioscuri, Castor and Polydeuces (Pollux in Latin). This was in the later eighth century, a time when the Spartans were, so to speak, rediscovering their roots, seeking to legitimize their recently won domain in south-east Peloponnese by presenting it as the legitimate successor of the kingdom of Menelaus as set out in Homer's <i>Iliad</i>. In actual fact, the cult of Helen at Therapne probably reflects a conflation of two Helens: one a goddess of vegetation and fertility associated with trees (also worshipped as such on Rhodes), the other the heroic Helen of Homeric legend. We shall stick with the latter.<br><br>More specifically, since Helen served later as an icon of Spartan womanhood and beauty, we must ask, was Helen raped (according to our usage of that term) by Paris or did she go with him consensually, of her own accord? Herodotus, father of history (in the phrase of Cicero), has three very interesting passages regarding Helen. The first comes in his opening aetiology of the Graeco-Persian Wars of the early fifth century, where he traces the history or mythography of Greek-Oriental enmity back through the mists of time and legend. A series of claims and counter-claims is wittily rehearsed, with Herodotus purporting merely to relate the stories he has been told by learned Phoenicians and Persians. Among them features, inevitably, the theft, if that is what it was, by Paris of Helen. Herodotus himself adopts a robust, not to say male chauvinist, view of the matter:<br><br><i>it is obvious that no young woman allows<br>herself to be abducted if she does not wish to be.</i><br><br>However, an unambiguous tale, not related by Herodotus, of an earlier rape of Helen, effected by Theseus of Athens when she was but a girl rather than an adult wife, tells a different story. Lately, both Elizabeth Cook in her imaginative retelling of Achilles' story and John Barton in his no less powerful <i>Tantalus</i> play-cycle have reminded us opportunely of this earlier, darker chapter in Helen's eventful life.<br><br>The next reference to Helen in Herodotus is, if anything, even more disturbing, from the historical point of view. For according to him, as he relates it in his account of matters Egyptian in the second book of his Histories, she never went to Troy at all, but sat out the ten years of the Trojan War in Egypt:<br><br><i>This is the account the Egyptian priests told me <br>of Helen's story, and I am inclined to accept it, on <br>the following ground: had Helen really been in <br>Troy, she would have been handed back to the <br>Greeks whether Paris consented or not... This, then, <br>is my own interpretation.</i><br><br>It was thus, for Herodotus, merely to recover a simulacrum, a phantom double, of Helen's face that Menelaus and Agamemnon and all the other Greeks had launched their thousand ships!<br><br>This heterodox version, for obvious reasons unused by Homer, was not original to Herodotus, since we know that it was being peddled as early as the mid-sixth century by the Greek lyric poet Stesichorus, from Himera in western Sicily. And after Herodotus it was again found congenial by the great Athenian dramatist Euripides, who based his surving melodrama <i>Helen</i> upon it; but for most ancients, as for most of us, Helen can safely remain Helen of Troy.<br><br>The third mention in Herodotus brings us back from Egypt to Sparta and more precisely to Helen's shrine at Therapne, which was the setting of a classic folktale, beautifully retold by Herodotus for his fifth-century audience. Once upon a time, somewhere in the second half of the sixth century in our terms, a wealthy Spartan couple had a daughter, but, alas, their beloved infant was distressingly plain. So plain that the family's nurse - perhaps a Helot woman - had the following bright idea:<br><br><i>Since she was plain to look at, and her parents, <br>who were well off, were distressed at her <br>unsightliness, her nurse had the idea of carrying <br>her every day to the shrine of Helen at what is <br>called Therapne, above the shrine of Apollo. She <br>would take the baby in, lay her in front of Helen's <br>cult-statue, and pray to the goddess to rid her of <br>her ugliness.</i><br><br>One day, an apparition - clearly meant to be Helen herself - addressed the nurse and stroked the child's head, whereafter she grew up to be the most beautiful of all the nubile Spartan girls, a suitable match and catch for a leading Spartan. Unfortunately for that Spartan, however, he had a best friend who was childless and who passionately fancied the friend's wife as the bearer of his own future, ideally male, offspring. Even more unfortunately, the best friend just happened to be a king of Sparta, for whom the production of legitimate male offspring was an affair of state and not just of the heart. In his intense desire to procreate this king had already married not just once but twice; now, besotted with his friend's wife, he added insult to injury, obtaining her from him by a low trick.<br><br>The product of the union of Ariston - for that was the king's name - with the unnamed female beauty was King Demaratus, whom we shall meet again later in circumstances of alleged illegitimacy and treachery - everyday charges in the fraught world of Spartan royalty. (See further his biography, in Chapter 2.) However, before we leave Helen, it is worth mentioning three very different expressions and consequences of her legend. First, as early as the seventh century, the priestess of Apollo at Delphi, the navel of the earth, issued a prophetic utterance on behalf of her lord and master Apollo that was translated by the male priests to include a reference to the women of Sparta, hailing them as the most beautiful in all Greece. That can only have been a bow to Helen of Sparta, whose fame, thanks to Homer, was spreading throughout the expanding Greek world, though it will have surely also put undue pressure, as we have seen, on Spartan girls and their parents to try to live up to Helen's awesome reputation.<br><br>Later, in the seventh century, the greatest of the ancient Greek women poets, Sappho from the island of Lesbos, engaged with Helen's reputation more than once. Sappho's verses can be quite conventional, as for example in the small fragment addressed to some beautiful and desired adolescent girl or young woman:<br><br><i>whenever I look at you <br>it seems to me that not even Hermione <br></i>[daughter of Helen]<i> is your equal <br>no, far better to compare you <br>to Helen, whose hair was golden.</i><br><br>On the other hand, Sappho could also be deeply and disturbingly unconventional. Flying in the face of normative, male value judgments, she writes, in a poem that happily survived on papyrus for centuries in the dry sands of Oxyrhynchus in Egypt, and was excavated only a century or so ago:<br><br><i>Some say a troop of horsemen, some an army on foot <br>and some a fleet of ships is the most lovely sight <br>on this dark earth; but I say it is that which <br>you desire:<br><br>... for the woman who far excelled all others <br>in her beauty, Helen, left her husband - <br>the best of all men - <br>behind and sailed far away to Troy; she did not spare<br>a single thought for her child </i>[Hermione]<i> nor for <br>her dear parents <br>but </i>[Aphrodite]<i> led her astray...</i><br><br>So Sappho both rejects masculine military values and at the same time excuses Helen's pursuit of the path of Love and Desire as being due to divine force majeure. That is not a message that the average Greek husband would have been delighted to hear.<br><br>The final expression and consequence I want to mention here is altogether more lighthearted, indeed literally comic. In 411 Aristophanes staged two comedies at the two major annual Athenian play-festivals in honour of Dionysus. One of these was the Lysistrata, the first known comedy to have been named after its heroine. Lysistrata, a respectable Athenian married woman, is portrayed respectfully. Seeking to put an end to the war between Athens and Sparta and their allies, which had been raging on and off for some twenty years (twice as long as the Trojan War), she organizes an international conspiracy of Greek women - or rather wives: the big idea is that their withdrawal of conjugal rights, a sex-strike, will force their bellicose but sex-starved husbands to the negotiating table and compel them to make peace (and so be able to make love once again) at last. The Spartan sororal delegate to the convention is one Lampito - she bears a good Spartan name, in fact the real name of the wife of a very recent Spartan king.<br><br>Here is how Aristophanes introduces Lampito (played of course by a male actor, in drag):<br><br><i>Welcome, Lampito, my very dear Spartan friend! <br></i>[says Lysistrata] <i><br>Sweetest, what beauty you display! What a fine colour of skin,<br>and what a robust frame you've got! You could throttle a bull!</i><br><br>To which Lampito replies, in broad local Spartan dialect:<br><br><i>Yes, indeed, I reckon I could, by the Two Gods</i> <br>[Castor and Pollux]; <br><i>at any rate, I do gymnastics and heel-to-buttock jumps.</i><br><br>Another Athenian co-conspiratrix joins in the fun: <br><br><i>What a splendid pair of tits you've got!<br></i><br>Lampito affects to be offended by this:<br><br><i>Really, you're feeling me over like a sacrificial victim.</i><br><br>The mainly Athenian audience, in between its guffaws, could hardly miss the allusion to the fact that Spartan women, unlike their own wives and sisters, were given a formal public training in gymnastics and athletics, performed either completely naked or at least partially nude. Perhaps too through these exercises Spartan women, unlike Athenian women, managed to keep their breasts in shape even after suckling babies - unless, of course they regularly resorted to Helot wet-nurses.<br><br>The <i>Lysistrata</i> ends also on a completely Spartan note, with first a Spartan man individually, and then Spartan couples jointly singing and dancing specifically Spartan songs and figures (the Greek word 'chorus' meant originally dance, before it came to mean collective singing). Notice particularly the final invocation of Helen, 'Leda's daughter':<br><br> <i>Leave lovely Taygetus again <br>and come, Laconian Muse, and fittingly <br>praise the god of Amyclae</i> [Apollo]<i> <br>and Athena of the Brazen House <br>and the noble sons of Tyndareus <br></i>[Castor and Pollux] <i> <br>who play beside the Eurotas.<br><br> Ola! Opa! <br>Prance lightly, that <br>we may hymn Sparta, <br>which delights in god-honouring dances <br>and in the beat of feet, <br>and where, like fillies, the maidens <br>prance beside the Eurotas, <br>raising dustclouds with their feet, <br>shaking their hair <br>like the hair of bacchantes who wield the thyrsus and dance.<br><br> And they are led by Leda's daughter, <br>their pure and beautiful chorus-leader.</i><br><br>In or around 1200 bc, the Mycenaean mansion at Therapne was burnt and destroyed, and the number and quality of the settlements in the region as a whole fell away drastically, so that by 1000 it is possible to speak of Laconia as undergoing a Dark Age. Some shafts of light are dimly visible in Sparta of the tenth and ninth centuries, for example at the shrine of Orthia by the Eurotas that would grow to play a key role in the later Spartan Agoge or Upbringing. However, it is not until the late eighth century, archaeologically, that the light becomes brighter and more evenly diffused. By then, there had been constructed a sanctuary to the city's patron goddess Athena, on what passed for an acropolis in Sparta; this is the Athena who later, in the sixth century, acquires the tag 'of the Brazen House' used by Aristophanes at the end of his <i>Lysistrata</i> (above). There was also an important sanctuary of Apollo in Amyclae just a few kilometres to the south of Sparta, also noted in the <i>Lysistrata</i>, and it is here rather than in Sparta proper that myth, religion and politics coalesced to produce the first glimmerings of a political history of the origins of the Spartan polis or state.</p><h2>Seven Steps to Effective Instructional Leadership</h2><p><b> Updated Edition of Best Seller!<p></p></b><i> "You won't find a more practical, detailed guide to improving school effectiveness than is contained between the covers of this book!"<br></i>Leonard O.

For generations of Americans this word&#x2014;the name of a bucolic stream in western Maryland&#x2014;held the same sense of horror and carnage that the simple date 9/11 does for modern America. But Antietam eclipses even this modern tragedy as America's single bloodiest day, on which 22,000 men became casualties in a war to determine our nation&#x2019;s future.<br><br>Antietam is forever burned into the American psyche, a battle bathed in blood that served no military purpose, brought no decisive victory. This much Americans know. What they didn't know is why this is so&#x2014;until now. <i>The Cornfield: Antietam's Bloody Turning Point</i> tells for the first time the full story of the exciting struggle to control &#x201c;the Cornfield,&#x201d; the action on which the costly battle of Antietam turned, in a thorough yet readable narrative. It explains what happened in Antietam&#x2019;s Cornfield and why. Because Federal and Confederate forces repeatedly traded control of the spot, the fight for the Cornfield is a story of human struggle against fearful odds, of men seeking to do their duty, of simply trying to survive. Many of the included firsthand accounts have never been revealed to modern readers and never have they been assembled in such a comprehensive, readable form.<br><br>At the same time, <i>The Cornfield </i>offers fresh views of the battle as a whole, arguing that it turned on events in the Cornfield because of two central facts &#x2014; Union General George McClellan&#x2019;s linear thinking demanded that the Cornfield must be taken and, because of this, the repeated failure by the generals McClellan charged with fulfilling this task created a self-reinforcing cycle of disaster that doomed the Union's prospects for success&#x2014;at the cost of thousands of lives.<br><br><i>The Cornfield</i> offers new perspectives that may be controversial&#x2014;particularly to those who accept unchallenged the views of the battle's first historians and its generals, who too often sought to shape our understanding for their own purposes&#x2014;but which are certain to change modern understanding of how the battle of Antietam was fought and its role in American history.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Chapter 1.

With a revised final chapter and expanded recommended readings, Roger Daniels's updated edition examines a tragic event in our nation's past and thoughtfully asks if it could happen again.</p></p><p><p><b>Roger Daniels</b>, the author of <i>Guarding the Golden Door</i>, is a renowned expert on Asian American and immigration history, was a consultant to the commission that recommended redress, and has served on the History Advisory Board for the Ellis Island Immigration Museum since its inception.</p>More proof that good things can come in small packages, this volume--along with two others--kicks off the publisher's ``Critical Issues'' series (consulting editor: Eric Foner), in which experts tackle historical issues whose consequences reverberate today. Not only do the authors of the first three volumes offer cogent overviews of their respective issues, but each is willing to climb out on a critical limb. Daniels (Concentration Camp USA, 1972), for instance, writing about the incarceration of Japanese-Americans during WW II, states that ``this book has tried to explain how and why the outrage happened. That is the role of the historian and his book, which is to analyze the past. But this historian feels that analyzing the past is not always enough''--and so he takes on the question of ``could it happen again?'' and concludes that there's ``an American propensity to react against `foreigners' in the United States during times of external crisis, especially when those `foreigners' have dark skins,'' and that Japanese-Americans, at least, ``would argue that what has happened before can surely happen again.'' Similarly, Kirkpatrick Sale--in The Green Revolution (ISBN: 0-8090-5218-0; paper: 0-8090-1551-X)--summarizes the modern history of American environmentalism (which he sees as dating from the publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring) and indicts ``a chemical industry that has subsequently produced some 30,000 chemicals of varying degrees of toxicity''), while Anthony F.C. Wallace--in The Long, Bitter Trail (ISBN: 0-8090-6631-9; paper: 0-8090-1552-8)--studies the legacy of Andrew Jackson's cruel Indian policies and declares that ``two hundred years of national indecision about how the United States should deal with its Native Americans have not come to an end.'' A promising beginning, then, to what looks like a very fine series with a cutting edge; future volumes will include Marvin Frankel on Church &amp; State, Michael Hunt on How We Became Involved in Vietnam, and Betty Wood on Origins of Slavery in the United States. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

They were supposed to be an advance guard, followed by other French ships with the leader of the rebellion, Wolfe Tone. Briefly they triumphed, raising hopes among the impoverished local peasantry and gathering a group of supporters. But before long the insurgency collapsed in the face of a brutal English counterattack.</p><p>Very few books succeed in registering the sudden terrible impact of historical events; Thomas Flanagan's is one. Subtly conceived, masterfully paced, with a wide and memorable cast of characters, <i>The Year of the French</i> brings to life peasants and landlords, Protestants and Catholics, along with old and abiding questions of secular and religious commitments, empire, occupation, and rebellion. It is quite simply a great historical novel.</p><p>Named the most distinguished work of fiction in 1979 by the National Book Critics' Circle.</p></p><p>Thomas Flanagan (1923&#x2013;2002), the grandson of Irish immigrants, grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut, where he ran the school newspaper with his friend Truman Capote. Flanagan attended Amherst College (with a two-year hiatus to serve in the Pacific Fleet) and earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University, where he studied under Lionel Trilling while also writing stories for <i>Ellery Queen&#x2019;s Mystery Magazine</i>. In 1959, he published an important scholarly work, <i>The Irish Novelists, 1800 to 1850</i>, and the next year he moved to Berkeley, where he was to teach English and Irish literature at the University of California for many years. In 1978 he took up a post at the State University of New York at Stonybrook, from which he retired in 1996. Flanagan and his wife Jean made annual trips to Ireland, where he struck up friendships with many writers, including Benedict Kiely and Seamus Heaney, whom he in turn helped bring to the United States. His intimate knowledge of Ireland&#x2019;s history and literature also helped to inspire his trilogy of historical novels, starting with The Year of the French (1979, winner of the National Critics&#x2019; Circle award for fiction, reissued by NYRB Classics in 2004) and continuing with <i>The Tenants of Time</i> (1988) and <i>The End of the Hunt </i>(1994). He is also the author of <i>There You Are: Writings on Irish and American Literature and History</i>&nbsp;(2004).&nbsp;Flanagan was a frequent contributor to many publications, including <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>The Kenyon Review</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>Seamus Deane, formerly Professor of English and American Literature at University College, Dublin, is now Keough Professor of Irish Studies at the University of Notre Dame.

Flanagan, an American history professor of Irish descent, pulled off a substantial coup in that he brought a historian's training to bear upon a romantic moment, the period when the French landed in the west of Ireland in 1798 and all Ireland thought liberation was at hand. His research never lies around the novel in pools, it stains the entire fabric, so that when his character's point of view is emerging from a dispossessed farmer's clay hovel or a small town merchant's table in the local hotel, we smell them - their clothes, their breath and (this is Ireland after all) their politics.&#x201d; &#x2014;Frank Delaney, <i>The Guardian</i><br><br>"A masterwork of historical fiction." &#x2014;<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br><br>"The book's wide-ranging scope and erudition are reminiscent of Tolstoy." &#x2014; <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"This deserves every major literary prize." &#x2014; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;In his prodigious first novel, Thomas Flanagan grants this historic episode a new and panoramic life....[a] thoughtful, graceful elegy.&#x201d; &#x2014; Mayo Mohs, <i>Time</i><br><br>&#x201c;Such a brutal and pathetic story would alone have sufficed to make this book absorbing, but Flanagan has much more on his mind.

The book rocketed multiple personality disorder into public consciousness and played a major role in having the diagnosis added to the psychiatric bible, <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>. But what do we really know about how Sybil came to be? In her news-breaking book <i>Sybil Exposed, </i>journalist Debbie Nathan gives proof that the allegedly true story outlined in the megabestseller was largely fabricated. The actual identity of Sybil (Shirley Mason) has been available for some years, as has the idea that the book might have been exaggerated. But Nathan reveals the trio of women behind the legend: the willing patient, her ambitious shrink, and the imaginative journalist who spun their story into bestseller gold. <br><br><i>Sybil Exposed </i>draws from an enormous trail of papers, records, photos, and tapes to unearth the lives and passions of these three women whose story exploded into an epic movement with consequences beyond their wildest dreams. Set across the twentieth century and rooted in a time when few professional roles were available to women, this is a story of corrosive sexism, bold but unchecked ambition, runaway greed, utter human vulnerability, duplicity and shared delusion, shaky theories of psychoanalysis exuberantly and drastically practiced, and how one modest young woman&#x2019;s life turned psychiatry on its head and radically changed the course of therapy&#x2014;and our culture, as well.</p><p><b>Debbie Nathan</b> was born and raised in Houston, Texas.

Something in her tone enraged him&#x2014;he was always on the brink of fury&#x2014;and, as she put down one of the slopping pails in the muddy patch before the tumbledown building, the rough wooden door banged open and the woodcutter surged out, his dirty shirt half open, his thick trousers flapping. He grabbed her free arm to hold her steady and slapped her hard, across the face. She reeled back from the blow, but gritted her jaw against the pain, and stood, head bowed, like a beaten ox.<br> <br>He brought his head close to hers and shouted, his spittle spraying into her impassive face. He let her go, and impulsively kicked over both pails into the mud; she would have to go to the stream again, and haul more water. He laughed, as if the thought of her pointless labor was the only funny thing in this bitterly hard world. But then his laughter died as he looked at her.<br> <br>She was not pressing her slapped cheek with the cold palm of her hand, nor bowing her head in sobs. She was not shrinking from him, nor picking up the rolling, empty buckets. She had spread out her hands wide; she was snapping her fingers as if to a drumbeat that only she could hear.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;Woman? Fool? What d&#x2019;you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her eyes were closed as if she could sense nothing but a smooth wooden floor and clean limewashed walls and candlelight, and the fresh smell of a swept barn ready for a midsummer dance. Her head was tipped, as if listening to the rattle of a tambourine and the tempting, irresistible saw of a fiddler. As he watched, quite bemused, she lifted the hem of her ragged dress, spread it wide, and started to dance, as pretty as a girl.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll dance you!&#x201d; He started toward her, but she did not shrink from him. She took three steps to the left and did a little jump, then three steps to the right. She turned round as if she were being spun by an attentive partner. Ignoring the icy mud on her bare feet, she started the part of the dance where the women circle the room, as if she were being watched by admirers, her head held high, her eyes blind to the leafless branches of the trees and the cold sky above them.<br> <br>He laid heavy hands on her shoulders and felt her jig beneath his grip as if he were about to dance with her. He tried to drag her into their hut, but she only danced toward the open door, bowed to the dirty interior, and danced back out again. He drew back his fist to thump her into unconsciousness, but something in her smiling, bland face made him hesitate: suddenly powerless, his hand fell to his side.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve gone mad,&#x201d; he said wonderingly. &#x201c;A madwoman you&#x2019;ve always been, but now you&#x2019;ve lost your wits, and you&#x2019;ll be the ruin of us all.&#x201d;</p><h2>When Churchill Slaughtered Sheep and Stalin Robbed a Bank: History&#39;s Unknown Chapters</h2><p><p><b>More addictive and mind-blowing true tales from history, told by Giles Milton&#x2015;one of today&#x2019;s most entertaining and accessible yet always intelligent and illuminating historians</b><br><b></b><br>In <i>When Churchill Slaughtered Sheep and Stalin Robbed a Bank</i>, the second installment in his outrageously entertaining series, History&#x2019;s Unknown Chapters, Giles Milton shows his customary historical flair as he delves into the little-known stories from history, like when Stalin was actually assassinated with poison by one of his inner circle; the Russian scientist, dubbed the &#x201c;Red Frankenstein,&#x201d; who attempted to produce a human-ape hybrid through ethically dubious means; the family who survived thirty-eight days at sea with almost no water or supplies after their ship was destroyed by a killer whale; or the plot that served as a template for 9/11 in which four Algerian terrorists attempted to hijack a plane and fly it into the Eiffel Tower.</p></p><p><b>Giles Milton</b> is a writer and journalist.

It is the ministry of prayer, a ministry that is largely neglected by the church today. The church is to pray, &#34;Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth&#34; (Mat 6:9). The church is to pray authoritative prayers which bind and loose that which heaven wills to bind and loose. The church is to pray through and put in execution all that God has purposed and called for in spite of opposition. The church is to use the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ in fulfilling her mission. In this present book, Watchman Nee touches upon all the various aspects of the ministry of the church. He exhorts the church to exercise her ministry as well as warns God&#39;s people against the sin of presumptuousness. How we need to first submit ourselves as a church to God&#39;s authority before we can exercise the given authority in prayer.

The other antiques stores that I&#x2019;ve passed on this cobblestoned alley have their air conditioners running and their doors closed against the heat, but this shop&#x2019;s door is propped open, as if inviting me to enter. It&#x2019;s my last afternoon in Rome, my last chance to pick up a souvenir of my visit. Already I&#x2019;ve bought a silk tie for Rob and an extravagantly ruffled dress for our three-�year-�old daughter, Lily, but I haven&#x2019;t found anything for myself. In the window of this antiques shop, I see exactly what I want.<br><br>I step into gloom so thick that my eyes need a moment to adjust. Outside it&#x2019;s sweltering, but in here it&#x2019;s strangely cool, as though I&#x2019;ve entered a cave where neither heat nor light can penetrate. Slowly, shapes take form in the shadows and I see book-�crammed shelves, old steamer trunks, and in the corner a medieval suit of tarnished armor. On the walls hang oil paintings, all of them garish and ugly and adorned with yellowed price tags. I don&#x2019;t notice that the proprietor is standing in the alcove, so I&#x2019;m startled when he suddenly calls out to me in Italian. I turn and see a little gnome of a man with eyebrows like snowy caterpillars.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I answer. &#x201c;Non parlo Italiano.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Violino?&#x201d; He points to the violin case that I have strapped to my back. It&#x2019;s far too valuable an instrument to leave in my hotel room and I always keep it with me while traveling. &#x201c;Musicista?&#x201d; he asks and plays air fiddle, his right arm sawing back and forth with a phantom bow.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m a musician. From America. I performed this morning, at the festival.&#x201d; Though he nods politely, I don&#x2019;t think he actually understands me. I point to the item I spotted in his display window. &#x201c;Could I see that book? Libro. Musica.&#x201d;<br><br>He reaches into the window display for the book of music and hands it to me. I know it&#x2019;s old, by the way the edges of the paper crumble at my touch. The edition is Italian, and on its cover is the word Gypsy and an image of a shaggy-�haired man playing the violin. I open it to the first tune, which is written in a minor key. The piece is unfamiliar, a plaintive melody that my fingers are already itching to play. Yes, this is what I&#x2019;m always on the hunt for, old music that&#x2019;s been forgotten and deserves to be rediscovered.<br><br>As I flip through the other tunes, a loose page falls out and flutters to the floor. Not part of the book, it is a sheet of manuscript paper, its staves thick with musical notes jotted in pencil. The composition&#x2019;s title is handwritten in elegantly swooping letters.<br><br>Incendio, composed by L. Todesco.<br><br>As I read the music, I can hear the notes in my head and within a few measures, I know this waltz is beautiful. It starts as a simple melody in E minor. But at measure sixteen, the music grows more complex. By measure sixty, notes start to pile on notes and there are jarring accidentals. I flip to the other side and every measure is dense with pencil marks. A lightning-�quick string of arpeggios launches the melody into a frantic maelstrom of notes that make the hairs suddenly rise on my arms.<br><br>I must have this music.<br><br>&#x201c;Quanto costa?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;For this page and for the book as well?&#x201d;<br><br>The proprietor watches me with a canny gleam in his eyes. &#x201c;Cento.&#x201d; He pulls out a pen and writes the number on his palm.<br><br>&#x201c;A hundred euros? You can&#x2019;t be serious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;E&#x2019; vecchio. Old.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that old.&#x201d;<br><br>His shrug tells me I can take it or leave it. He&#x2019;s already seen the hunger in my eyes; he knows he can charge me an outrageous price for this crumbling volume of Gypsy tunes and I&#x2019;ll pay it. Music is my only extravagance. I have no interest in jewelry or designer clothes and shoes; the only accessory I truly value is the hundred-�year-�old violin now strapped to my back.<br><br>He hands me a receipt for my purchase and I walk out of the shop, into afternoon heat that&#x2019;s as cloying as syrup. How odd that I felt so cold inside. I look back at the building, but I don&#x2019;t see any air conditioner, just closed windows and twin gargoyles perched above the pediment. A shard of sunlight bounces back at me, reflected from the brass Medusa-�head knocker. The door is now closed, but through the dusty window I glimpse the proprietor looking at me, just before he drops the shade and vanishes from sight.<br><br>...<br><br>My husband, Rob, is thrilled with the new tie I bought him in Rome. He stands at our bedroom mirror, expertly looping lustrous silk around his neck. &#x201c;This is just the thing I need to jazz up a boring meeting,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Maybe these colors will keep them all awake when I start going over the numbers.&#x201d; At thirty-�eight, he&#x2019;s as lean and fit as the day we married, although the last ten years have added streaks of silver to his temples. In his starched white shirt and gold cuff links, my Boston-�bred husband looks exactly like the meticulous accountant he is. He&#x2019;s all about numbers: profits and losses, assets and debts. He sees the world in mathematical terms, and even the way he moves has a precise geometry to it, his tie swinging an arc, crisscrossing into a perfect knot. How different we are! The only numbers I care about are symphony and opus numbers and the time signatures on my music. Rob tells everyone that&#x2019;s why he was attracted to me, because unlike him, I&#x2019;m an artist and air creature who dances in the sunshine. I used to worry that our differences would tear us apart, that Rob, who keeps his feet so firmly planted on the ground, would grow weary of keeping his air-�creature wife from floating away into the clouds. But ten years later, here we are, still in love.<br><br>He smiles at me in the mirror as he tightens the knot at his throat. &#x201c;You were awake awfully early this morning, Julia.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m still on Rome time. It&#x2019;s already twelve noon there. That&#x2019;s the upside of jet lag. Just think of all the things I&#x2019;ll get done today.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I predict you&#x2019;ll be ready to collapse by lunchtime. You want me to drive Lily to day care?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I want to keep her home today. I feel guilty about being away from her all week.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t. Your aunt Val swooped in and took care of everything, the way she always does.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I missed her like crazy and I want to spend every minute with her today.&#x201d;<br><br>He turns to show me his new tie, perfectly centered on his collar. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s on the agenda?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s so hot, I think we&#x2019;ll go to the pool. Maybe drop into the library and choose some new books.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sounds like a plan.&#x201d; He bends to kiss me, and his clean-�shaven face smells tart with citrus. &#x201c;I hate it when you&#x2019;re gone, babe,&#x201d; he murmurs. &#x201c;Maybe next time, I&#x2019;ll take the week off and we&#x2019;ll go together. Wouldn&#x2019;t that be a lot more&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mommy, look! Look how pretty!&#x201d; Our three-�year-�old daughter, Lily, dances into the bedroom and swirls around in the new dress I brought her from Rome, the dress that she tried on last night and now refuses to take off. Without warning she launches herself like a missile into my arms and we both tumble onto the bed, laughing. There is nothing so sweet as the smell of my own child, and I want to inhale every molecule of her, absorb her back into my own body so we can become one again. As I hug the giggling tangle of blond hair and lavender ruffles, Rob drops onto the bed, too, and wraps us both in his arms.<br><br>&#x201c;Here are the two most beautiful girls in the world,&#x201d; he declares. &#x201c;And they&#x2019;re mine, all mine!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Daddy, stay home,&#x201d; Lily orders.<br><br>&#x201c;Wish I could, sweetie.&#x201d; Rob plants a noisy kiss on Lily&#x2019;s head and reluctantly gets back to his feet. &#x201c;Daddy has to go to work, but aren&#x2019;t you a lucky girl? You get to spend all day with Mommy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go put on our bathing suits,&#x201d; I tell Lily. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to have a wonderful time, just you and me.&#x201d;<br><br>And we do have a wonderful time. We splash in the community pool. We eat cheese pizza and ice cream for lunch and go to the library, where Lily chooses two new picture books featuring donkeys, her favorite animal. But when we get home at three that afternoon, I&#x2019;m almost comatose from exhaustion. As Rob predicted, jet lag has caught up with me and there&#x2019;s nothing I want to do more than to crawl into bed and go to sleep.<br><br>Unfortunately, Lily&#x2019;s wide awake and she&#x2019;s dragged the box of her old baby clothes out onto the patio, where our cat, Juniper, is snoozing. Lily loves dressing up Juniper and already she&#x2019;s tied a bonnet around his head and is working one of his front paws into a sleeve. Our sweet old cat endures it as he always does, indifferent to the indignities of lace and ruffles.<br><br>While Juniper gets his fashion makeover, I bring my violin and music stand onto the patio and open the book of Gypsy tunes. Once again, the loose sheet of music slips out, landing faceup at my feet. Incendio.<br><br>I haven&#x2019;t looked at this music since the day I bought it in Rome. Now, as I clip the page to the stand, I think of that gloomy antiques shop, and the proprietor, lurking like some cave creature in the alcove. Goose bumps suddenly stipple my skin, as if the chill of the shop still clings to this music.<br><br>I pick up my violin and begin to play.<br><br>On this humid afternoon, my instrument sounds deeper, richer than ever, the tone mellow and warm. The first thirty-�two bars of the waltz are as beautiful as I&#x2019;d imagined, a lament in a mournful baritone. But at measure forty, the notes accelerate. The melody twists and turns, jarred by accidentals, and soars into seventh position on the E string. Sweat breaks out on my face as I struggle to stay in tune and maintain the tempo. I feel as if my bow takes off on its own, that it&#x2019;s moving as though bewitched and I&#x2019;m just struggling to hang on to it. Oh, what glorious music this is! What a performance piece, if I can master it. The notes skitter up the scale. Suddenly I lose all control and everything goes off-�pitch, my left hand cramping as the music builds to a frenzy.<br><br>A small hand grasps my leg. Something warm and wet smears my skin.<br><br>I stop playing and look down. Lily stares up at me, her eyes as clear as turquoise water. Even as I jump up in dismay and wrench the garden tool from her bloody hand, not a ripple disturbs her calm blue eyes. Her bare feet have tracked footprints across the patio flagstones. With growing horror, I follow those footprints back to the source of the blood.<br><br>That&#x2019;s when I start screaming.<br><br>2<br><br>Rob helps me wash the cat&#x2019;s blood from the patio. Poor old Juniper is now wrapped in a black trash bag, awaiting burial. We&#x2019;ve dug the hole for his grave in the far corner of the yard, behind the lilac bush, so I will not have to look at it whenever I come into the garden. Juniper was eighteen years old and almost blind, a gentle companion who deserves a better eternity than a trash bag, but I was too shaken to come up with any alternative.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it was just an accident,&#x201d; Rob insists. He tosses the dirty sponge into the bucket and the water magically turns a nauseating shade of pink. &#x201c;Lily must have tripped and fallen on him. Thank God she didn&#x2019;t land with the sharp end up, or she could have put out her eye. Or worse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wrapped him in the trash bag. I saw his body, and it wasn&#x2019;t just a single stab wound. How do you trip and fall three times?&#x201d;<br><br>He ignores my question. Instead, he picks up the murder weapon, a dandelion fork tipped with prongs, and asks, &#x201c;How did she get her hands on this thing, anyway?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was out here weeding last week. I must have forgotten to put it back in the tool shed.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s still blood on the prongs and I turn away. &#x201c;Rob, doesn&#x2019;t it bother you how she&#x2019;s reacting to all this? She stabbed Juniper and a few minutes later, she asked for juice. That&#x2019;s what freaks me out, how perfectly calm she is about what she did.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s too young to understand. A three-�year-�old doesn&#x2019;t know what death means.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She must have known she was hurting him. He must have made some kind of sound.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you hear it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was playing the violin, right here. Lily and Juniper were at that end of the patio. They seemed perfectly fine together. Until . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe he scratched her. Maybe he did something to provoke her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go upstairs and take a look at her arms. She doesn&#x2019;t have a single mark on her. And you know how sweet that cat was. You could yank on his fur, step on his tail, and he&#x2019;d never scratch you. I&#x2019;ve had him since he was just a kitten, and for him to die this way . . .&#x201d; My voice cracks and I sink into a patio chair as it all washes over me, a tidal wave of grief and exhaustion. And guilt, because I couldn&#x2019;t protect my old friend, even as he bled to death only twenty feet away. Rob awkwardly pats my shoulder, not knowing how to comfort me. My logical, mathematical husband is helpless when it comes to dealing with a woman&#x2019;s tears.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey.

In <b>The Turn of the Screw</b>, a governess is haunted by ghosts from her young charges past; Virginia Woolf said of this masterpiece of psychological ambiguity and suggestion, We are afraid of something unnamed, of something, perhaps, in ourselves...Henry James...can still make us afraid of the dark.<br><br>In his rarely anthologized novella <b>In the Cage</b>, James brings his incomparable powers of observation to the story of a clever, rebellious heroine of Britain's lower middle class. Hortense Calisher, in her Introduction, calls it a delicious story, the more so because it confounds what we expect from James.</p><p>"[James] is the most intelligent man of his generation."--T. S. Eliot<br>Hortense Calisher is the author of twenty-two books, including the National Book Award nominees <b>False Entry</b>; <b>Herself: Autobiography of a Writer</b>; and <b>Collected Stories of Hortense Calisher</b>.

He is the author of several books that have become classics of motivation and healthier, happier living.&#34;This classic metaphysical book offers excellent grounding in the principles of Science of Mind as taught by Holmes.&#34; --Science of Mind Magazine</p><h2>The Plot to Scapegoat Russia: How the CIA and the Deep State Have Conspired to Vilify Russia</h2><p><b>An in-depth look at the decades-long effort to escalate hostilities with Russia and what it portends for the future.</b><br><br>Since 1945, the US has justified numerous wars, interventions, and military build-ups based on the pretext of the Russian Red Menace, even after the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991 and Russia stopped being Red. In fact, the two biggest post-war American conflicts, the Korean and Vietnam wars, were not, as has been frequently claimed, about stopping Soviet aggression or even influence, but about maintaining old colonial relationships. Similarly, many lesser interventions and conflicts, such as those in Latin America, were also based upon an alleged Soviet threat, which was greatly overblown or nonexistent. And now the specter of a Russian Menace has been raised again in the wake of Donald Trump&#x2019;s election.<br><br><b><i>The Plot to Scapegoat Russia</i></b> examines the recent proliferation of stories, usually sourced from American state actors, blaming and manipulating the threat of Russia, and the long history of which this episode is but the latest chapter. It will show readers two key things: (1) the ways in which the United States has needlessly provoked Russia, especially after the collapse of the USSR, thereby squandering hopes for peace and cooperation; and (2) how Americans have lost out from this missed opportunity, and from decades of conflicts based upon false premises. These revelations, amongst other, make <b><i>The Plot to Scapegoat Russia</i></b> one of the timeliest reads of 2017.</p><p>This book grew out of an article I wrote called, "Listen Liberals: Russia is Not Our Enemy." The book attempts to counter the anti-Russia hysteria which is being pushed by the intelligence community, the mainstream media and the Democratic Party. &nbsp; This anti-Russia hysteria is leading out country towards a confrontation with Russia which is both unnecessary and quite dangerous. &nbsp;In many ways, the book is a plea for peace.<br>I think the reader will find the book to be unique and surprising, connecting numerous issues and ideas in ways which I hope will lead to a greater understanding of our country's historic relationship with Russia and the rest of the world.<br>It was a whirlwind writing the book because we wanted to make sure it got out in a timely way while also being of the highest quality. &nbsp;With the help of Skyhorse Publishing, I think we accomplished this goal.<br>This is my first book, and I am quite excited about it. &nbsp;<b>I am donating 50% of my proceeds of the book to UNICEF's project in eastern Ukraine</b> which is in grave crisis, with over 1 million children in grave need of food support. &nbsp;<b>David Talbot</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years</i> and <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Chessboard</i>.

He shows how to simplify the hands and feet of children and adults, with illustrations and an easy-to-understand section on the importance of anatomy and proportions. Further explanations about light, shade and tone give helpful advice on capturing the essence of the drawing. Many different techniques are included, from the linear method where the contours of the shapes are sketched, to the structural method where the main areas are emphasised. For anyone interested in the figure, this book is invaluable. It is packed with information, quick sketches and more elaborate works.</p><p>GIOVANNI CIVARDI was born in Milan in 1947. While training to become a sculptor, portrait artist and illustrator at the Free Life-Study School of the Accademia di Brera, he also studied medicine and surgery. For over a decade, he worked as an illustrator, producing commissions for newspapers, magazines and book covers. During frequent trips to France and Denmark, Civardi put on one-man exhibitions of this work and pursued his interest in studying the relationship between medical anatomy and the human form as depicted by the artist. His experience gained from teaching anatomy, life drawing and portraiture in schools and institutions over many years has led to the publication of numerous books in which Civardi&#39;s experiences are brought into focus.Oct 05 Hands and feet are always one of the hardest things to draw but Giovanni Civardi takes the tediousness out of this task and turns it into an enjoyable pastime...Each chapter in this book is interesting as he guides you through drawing accurately, the bones, veins, and skin of the anatomy to achieve a realistic result. Methods are explained clearly and advice on light, shading and movement is very useful. * minigallery.co.uk *</p><h2>Technics and Civilization</h2><p><p><i>Technics and Civilization</i> first presented its compelling history of the machine and critical study of its effects on civilization in 1934&#x2014;before television, the personal computer, and the Internet even appeared on our periphery.</p> <p>Drawing upon art, science, philosophy, and the history of culture, Lewis Mumford explained the origin of the machine age and traced its social results, asserting that the development of modern technology had its roots in the Middle Ages rather than the Industrial Revolution. Mumford sagely argued that it was the moral, economic, and political choices we made, not the machines that we used, that determined our then industrially driven economy. Equal parts powerful history and polemic criticism, <i>Technics and Civilization</i> was the first comprehensive attempt in English to portray the development of the machine age over the last thousand years&#x2014;and to predict the pull the technological still holds over us today.</p> <p><i> &#x201c;</i>The questions posed in the first paragraph of <i>Technics and Civilization</i> still deserve our attention, nearly three quarters of a century after they were written.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Journal of Technology and Culture</i></p></p><p><p><b>Lewis Mumford </b>(1895&#x2013;1990) was a writer whose scope encompassed literary criticism, architecture, history, urban sociology, and philosophy.

But <strong>Understanding Narrative Inquiry</strong> may also serve to extend the knowledge of researchers and practitioners in those fields who are already familiar with this rapidly maturing inquiry approach. Extremely well researched and referenced, it deftly addresses sophisticated theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of narrative research, including the rationales and justifications for engaging in both storytelling and the analysis of stories. And it also explores a wide variety of helpful strategies for interviewing, fieldwork, and writing. But just as importantly, it grounds and humanizes its sophisticated scholarship through an inviting, conversational style replete with personal anecdotes, while its many concrete examples of research practice in action further enhances its usefulness. A remarkable achievement. Author: Tom Barone<br><br>This is an outstanding text on narrative inquiry. Kim offers the historical and philosophical context for narrative research, ample methodological instruction, and robust examples, making this a truly comprehensive text.

Author: Patricia Leavy<br><br>Jeong-Hee Kim masterfully positions readers to enter the storied fabric of human life through the medium of narrative inquiry. Readers across all disciplines and interests will find themselves locating and articulating the textured significances of stories as research. Philosophical/theoretical connections substantively frame and permeate the text with readers importantly gaining context, language, and capacities to design and undertake fitting narrative inquiries.&nbsp; The concrete examples depicting a cross section of genres and the inclusion of a glossary make this comprehensive text an invaluable resource for all interested in crafting and analysis of research through narrative inquiry.<br> Author: Margaret Macintyre Latta<br><br>This text offers novice and practicing scholars of narrative inquiry provocative philosophical and methodological insights. The text is beautifully written and draws on art, music, religion, philosophy, and literature to inform researchers&#x2019; understandings. Author: Mary Louise Gomez<br><br>The author&#x2019;s use of a conversational tone&#x2015;as if she is talking directly to her students&#x2015;while guiding the reader through complex theoretical material is noteworthy, as are the expertly designed "Questions for Reflection" and the "Activities" sections at the end of each chapter.

Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) during the final three years of its four-year lifespan, from 1995 to 1998, and is the first U.S. government official involved with the medical evidence to allege a coverup in President Kennedy&#39;s autopsy, and in the creation of the autopsy photographs and x-rays. This book, the product of over 13 years of writing and research, provides the best explanation yet offered of the true nature of the medical coverup in the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and does so in meticulous detail, with scrupulous use of primary source material. It incorporates the latest information---much of it new evidence not revealed elsewhere---gleaned from the ARRB&#39;s depositions and interviews of medical witnesses, conducted from 1996 to 1998. With precise accuracy, and with a relentless focus on the massive fraud uncovered in the official records of the 35th President&#39;s assassination, Horne presents a persuasive case that the assassination of JFK was an &#34;inside job,&#34; a true coup d&#39;etat in America, that was ruthlessly and brazenly covered up by those who &#39;broke the back of the American century&#39; in Dallas on November 22, 1963. IN VOLUME ONE, THE AUTHOR EXPLAINS THE ORIGINS AND PURPOSE OF THE ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD (ARRB), AND RELATES HOW HE CAME TO JOIN THAT EFFORT IN 1995. HE PRESENTS AN OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR CONFLICTS WITHIN THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE IN THE JFK CASE, AND TAKES THE READER INSIDE THE ARRB TO WITNESS ITS DEPOSITIONS OF THE THREE MILITARY PATHOLOGISTS WHO PERFORMED JFK&#39;S AUTOPSY. HE COMMENCES HIS LONG EXAMINATION OF THE MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE COLLECTION OF AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES (WHICH IS CONCLUDED IN VOLUME TWO).

The author follows the 42-day war from the first night to the final day, providing vivid accounts of bombing runs, White House strategy sessions, firefights, and bitter internal conflicts.</p><p>Rick Atkinson won a Pulitzer Prize in 1983 for a series of articles on West Point's Class of 1966, which later became the basis for his best-selling book <i>The Long Gray Line.</i> A veteran staff reporter for the <i>Washington Post,</i> he wrote the <i>Post</i>'s lead stories during the Gulf War.Exhaustive, albeit consistently absorbing, record of the 42- day Gulf War that offers fresh, often startling, perspectives on the planning and conduct of what the author characterizes as ``a brilliant slaughter.'' Focusing almost entirely on military operations, Pulitzer- winning Washington Post correspondent Atkinson (The Long Gray Line, 1989) provides a chronological account of how the US-led coalition liberated Kuwait. In the course of doing so, he discloses that Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf could be an imperious martinet given to volcanic rages that not only cowed subordinates but also disturbed superiors (including Defense Secretary Richard Cheyney), who considered relieving him. The author also includes new details on, among other matters, how Washington persuaded Israel to eschew retaliation for Scud strikes; the aerial assault on Baghdad's Al Firdes bunker (which killed over 200 civilians and led to restrictions on strategic bombing); the hit-or-miss efforts of allied navies to clear mines from important waterways; disputes between intelligence agencies as to damage assessments; secret routes flown by US missiles on their way to enemy targets; the command decision to halt a rout short of annihilation; and the post-ceasefire action that decimated a fleeing Republican Guard division. Atkinson's episodic narrative also affords a coherent log of the successful air/sea/land campaign to oust Saddam from Kuwait. He recounts the contributions of the hang-loose French and British contingents, and unobtrusively puts crucial Gulf engagements in clearer context with allusions to feats of arms from the distant and recent past. Nor does Atkinson fail to point out that the professionalism displayed in achieving a deliberately limited triumph at a modest cost in casualties all but erased the stigma left by US involvement in Vietnam. Military history of a very high order.

Sharp and satisfying.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</i>(starred review)</b></p><p>John Ross, the tortured, conflicted Knight of the Word from Terry Brooks's <i>Running with the Demon</i>, finally gets a good night's sleep in the sequel. He buys this moment's peace at the cost of his sacred oath to be a champion of the Word, renouncing that pledge after failing to prevent the slaughter of a group of schoolchildren. Duty and destiny are difficult to elude, though, and soon his former charge Nest Freemark, now a college student and Olympic hopeful, arrives to warn him of his imminent destruction, or, worse, his unwitting fall into the service of the Void. <p> The story winds lazily through sleepy, wet Seattle like a tour bus, steadily building. Everything eventually converges on the homeless shelter where John works with his new sweetie Stefanie Winslow for �ber-activist Simon Lawrence, a man his dreams tell him he is fated to kill. A thin mystery clouds the identity of the demon conspiring to deliver John unto evil, but the book's real focus is John's fitful, foot-dragging attempts to fulfill his destiny. <i>Knight</i> doesn't provide the suspenseful energy of <i>Running</i>, a book that followed Nest through the dramatic loss of her childhood, but it rejoins her as she assumes the responsibilities of young adulthood and--like that period in life--still manages to deliver satisfying, if more subtle, rewards. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Eight centuries ago the first Knight of the Word was commissioned to combat the demonic evil of the Void.

'Adventure into the unknown' is more like it. And, like any adventure, there's bound to be some rivers to cross and mountains to climb.</p><p>If you're a new parent, you'll be discovering this for yourself. Your baby is beyond adorable, but some of the learning curves are probably steeper than you'd expected. Breastfeeding doesn't necessarily come naturally at first. Settling your baby can leave <i>you</i> with frayed nerves. Negotiating visits from your in-laws can cause conflict and your partner just doesn't understand. Some days you're ahead and others you're feeling snowed under. You may wonder what's happening and why it's happening to you, when everyone on Instagram seems to be doing just fine.</p><p>If this sounds like you, don't worry, you're not alone! Forget Instagram. Most new parents struggle at some stage. Chances are you just weren't prepared for it all. You had regular check-ups during pregnancy, a team for your birth and then nothing, nada, zip. You and your partner have to figure out all the 'after you get the baby home stuff' on your own. </p><p>But what if you could both plan now for the next river or mountain or snow day? Even if you have older children? What if you could have foresight for the normal and common parenthood challenges that life's likely to throw at you over the next few years? What if, no matter where you were in your parenthood adventure, there was a way, not only to cope with the challenges, but to pull closer as a couple through them and become the best parenting team possible at the same time?</p><p>There <i>is</i> a way. It's never too late to create the family you dream about. AND you don't have to figure it all out on your own. You may just need some direction to get you to the next stage.</p><p>Based on 15 years of research, Becoming Us describes the normal stages that mothers, fathers, and partners go through as they raise a family, and ways to navigate each stage. People say nothing can prepare parents for parenthood, but Becoming Us gives you the knowledge, practical skills and guidance to love, learn and grow - step by step - into a family that thrives.</p></p><p>Hi, I&#39;m Elly Taylor. I&#39;m becoming known as the &#34;Parenthood Tour Guide&#34; for my Becoming Us approach to the parenthood adventure.

The goals of the book are to help readers: <ul><li>expand cultural awareness of one&#x2019;s own culture and that of others</li><li>achieve a deeper understanding of what culture is and the relationship between culture and language</li><li>acquire the ability to observe behaviors in order to draw conclusions based on observation rather than preconceptions</li><li>understand and implement observations of cultural similarities and differences</li><li>develop an attitude of tolerance toward cultural differences and move away from the &#x201c;single story.&#x201d;</li></ul>The new edition has been thoroughly updated and includes a Suggested Projects section in each chapter. This section provides opportunities for users of the text to explore in greater depth an area and topic of interest. It also includes even more Critical Incidents--brief descriptions of events that depict some element or elements of cultural differences, miscommunication, or culture clash. Critical Incidents develop users&#x2019; ability to analyze and understand how multiple perspectives of the same situation are rooted in differing culturally influenced beliefs, behaviors, norms of interaction, and worldviews.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p>Andrea DeCapua is Adjunct Professor of Teaching and Learning Steinhardt School of Education.

I can&#39;t point to any one practice and say it&#39;s responsible, but together, they have shifted just about everything about me. The transformative process isn&#39;t always blissful. In fact, it is often profoundly uncomfortable, but when it really comes down to it, what else is there? Yoga and meditation fuel the fire, and writing gives me a way to read the smoke signals that rise up from inner experience. I take delight in reporting on the journey.&#34;</p><h2>For Calvinism</h2><p>The system of theology known as Calvinism has been immensely influential for the past five hundred years, but it is often encountered negatively as a fatalistic belief system that confines human freedom and renders human action and choice irrelevant. Taking us beyond the caricatures, Michael Horton invites us to explore the teachings of Calvinism, also commonly known as Reformed theology, by showing us how it is biblical and God-centered, leading us to live our lives for the glory of God.Horton explores the historical roots of Calvinism, walking readers through the distinctive known as the &#x201c;Five Points,&#x201d; and encouraging us to consider its rich resources for faith and practice in the 21st Century. As a companion to Roger Olson&#x2019;s Against Calvinism, readers will be able to compare contrasting perspectives and form their own opinions on the merits and weaknesses of Calvinism.</p><p><p>Michael Horton (PhD) is Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics at Westminster Seminary in&nbsp;California.

Heather Cox Richardson argues instead that class, along with race, was critical to Reconstruction's end. Northern support for freed blacks and Reconstruction weakened in the wake of growing critiques of the economy and calls for a redistribution of wealth. </p><p>Using newspapers, public speeches, popular tracts, Congressional reports, and private correspondence, Richardson traces the changing Northern attitudes toward African-Americans from the Republicans' idealized image of black workers in 1861 through the 1901 publication of Booker T. Washington's Up from Slavery. She examines such issues as black suffrage, disenfranchisement, taxation, westward migration, lynching, and civil rights to detect the trajectory of Northern disenchantment with Reconstruction. She reveals a growing backlash from Northerners against those who believed that inequalities should be addressed through working-class action, and the emergence of an American middle class that championed individual productivity and saw African-Americans as a threat to their prosperity.</p><p><i>The Death of Reconstruction</i> offers a new perspective on American race and labor and demonstrates the importance of class in the post-Civil War struggle to integrate African-Americans into a progressive and prospering nation.</p></p><p>Heather Cox Richardson is Associate Professor of American History, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<i>The Death of Reconstruction</i> offers a provocative explanation of why Northerners after the Civil War gradually and often reluctantly abandoned their efforts on behalf of the Southern freedmen. Not ignoring virulent racism directed at African Americans, Richardson shows that it was less race than class that brought about the end of Reconstruction. An important, impressively documented book, <i>The Death of Reconstruction</i> is a work comparable to David Montgomery's <i>Beyond Equality</i> as a major reinterpretation of the post-Civil War period. (David Herbert Donald, author of <i>Lincoln</i>)<br><br>Heather Richardson's <i>The Death of Reconstruction</i> is a work of genuine originality and imagination. Steeped in remarkable research, this is a persuasive account of how economic world views drove Northerners' retreat from Reconstruction; it makes us view Reconstruction from a different angle and helps explain, as well as any book has, the deep significance of individualism in American life in the late nineteenth century. (David W. Blight, author of <i>Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory</i>)<br><br>[Richardson] makes extensive use of contemporary newspaper articles, periodicals, speeches, and personal accounts to capture this tumultuous era in American history. Highly recommended for academic libraries. (Robert Flatley <i>Library Journal</i> 2001-08-01)<br><br>In <i>The Death of Reconstruction</i> the author's main concern is with attitudes in the North, not in the states of the former Confederacy. She notes that most Northerners had little direct contact with blacks, because only 10 percent of them lived in the North. In the years immediately after the war, the Republican press in the North took a benign view of blacks as a group, portraying them as poor but eager to work their way to prosperity as free labor...The most interesting aspect of this book is the reminder it affords that the debate over "affirmative action" is not a modern phenomenon but can be traced back to the 19th century...[Richardson's] focus on class conflict is a useful addition to other writings on the Gilded Age. (John M. Taylor <i>Washington Times</i> 2001-09-30)<br><br>At last readers have an explanation of why the Republican Party, founded in antislavery, dedicated to emancipation, and the political inspiration for the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution, abandoned those causes in favor of an ideology which acquiesced in the disenfranchisement of blacks and in the triumph of Jim Crow. Arguing that Republicans came to see the majority of African Americans as potential labor radicals in the tradition of the Paris Commune and the labor agitation of the US strikes of the late 19th century, [Richardson]...documents that this led to political abandonment...This is an important contribution for all historians who want a better understanding of the South or the African American experience, and anyone who wants good political history.

He wrote the first edition of this text while on the faculty of the Department of Pharmacology at University of California, San Diego.<br>CHOOSING BETWEEN PARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC TESTS (Excerpted from Chapter 37) <p>Choosing the right test to compare measurements is a bit tricky, as you must choose between two families of tests: parametric and nonparametric. Many -statistical tests are based upon the assumption that the data are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. These tests are referred to as parametric tests. Commonly used parametric tests are listed in the first column of the table and include the t test and analysis of variance. </p><p>Tests that do not make assumptions about the population distribution are referred to as nonparametric- tests. You've already learned a bit about nonparametric tests in previous chapters. All commonly used nonparametric tests rank the outcome variable from low to high and then analyze the ranks. These tests are listed in the second column of the table and include the Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney test, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. These tests are also called distribution-free tests. </p><p>THE EASY CASES </p><p>Choosing between parametric and nonparametric tests is sometimes easy. You should definitely choose a parametric test if you are sure that your data are sampled from a population that follows a Gaussian distribution (at least approximately). You should definitely select a nonparametric test in three situations: </p><p>1. The outcome is a rank or a score and the population is clearly not Gaussian. Examples include class ranking of students, the Apgar score for the health of newborn babies (measured on a scale of 0 to IO and where all scores are integers), the visual analogue score for pain (measured on a continuous scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is unbearable pain), and the star scale commonly used by movie and restaurant critics (* is OK, ***** is fantastic). </p><p>2. Some values are "off the scale," that is, too high or too low to measure. Even if the population is Gaussian, it is impossible to analyze such data with a parametric test since you don't know all of the values. Using a nonparametric test wi! th these data is simple. Assign values too low to measure an arbitrary very low value and assign values too high to measure an arbitrary very high value. Then perform a nonparametric test. Since the nonparametric test only knows about the relative ranks of the values, it won't matter that you didn't know all the values exactly. </p><p>3. The data are measurements and you are sure that the population is not distributed in a Gaussian manner. If the data are not sampled from a Gaussian distribution, consider whether you can transformed the values to make the distribution become Gaussian. For example, you might take the logarithm or reciprocal of all values. There are often biological or chemical reasons (as well as statistical ones) for performing a particular transform. </p><p>THE HARD CASES </p><p>It is not always easy to decide whether a sample comes from a Gaussian population. Consider these points: </p><p>If you collect many data points (over a hundred or so), you can look at the distribution of data and it will be fairly obvious whether the distribution is approximately bell shaped. A formal statistical test (Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test, not explained in this book) can be used to test whether the distribution of the data differs significantly from a Gaussian distribution. With few data points, it is difficult to tell whether the data are Gaussian by inspection, and the formal test has little power to discriminate between Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions. </p><p>You should look at previous data as well. Remember, what matters is the distribution of the overall population, not the distribution of your sample. In deciding whether a population is Gaussian, look at all available data, not just data in the current experiment. </p><p>Consider the source of scatter. When the scatter comes from the sum of numerous sources (with no one source contributing most of the scatter), you expect to find a roughly Gaussian distribution. </p><p>When in doubt, some people choose a parametric test (because they aren't sure the Gaussian assumption is ! violated), and others choose a nonparametric test (because they aren't sure the Gaussian assumption is met). </p><p>DOES IT MATTER? </p><p>Does it matter whether you choose a parametric or nonparametric test? The answer depends on sample size. There are four cases to think about: </p><p>1. Large sample. What happens when you use a parametric test with data from a nongaussian population? The central limit theorem (discussed in Chapter 5) ensures that parametric tests work well with large samples even if the population is non-Gaussian. In other words, parametric tests are robust to deviations from Gaussian distributions, so long as the samples are large. The snag is that it is impossible to say how large is large enough, as it depends on the nature of the particular non-Gaussian distribution. Unless the population distribution is really weird, you are probably safe choosing a parametric test when there are at least two dozen data points in each group. </p><p>2. Large sample. What happens when you use a nonparametric test with data from a Gaussian population? Nonparametric tests work well with large samples from Gaussian populations. The P values tend to be a bit too large, but the discrepancy is small. In other words, nonparametric tests are only slightly less powerful than parametric tests with large samples. </p><p>3. Small samples. What happens when you use a parametric test with data from nongaussian populations? You can't rely on the central limit theorem, so the P value may be inaccurate. </p><p>4. Small samples. When you use a nonparametric test with data from a Gaussian population, the P values tend to be too high. The nonparametric tests lack statistical power with small samples. </p><p>Thus, large data sets present no problems. It is usually easy to tell if the data come from a Gaussian population, but it doesn't really matter because the nonparametric tests are so powerful and the parametric tests are so robust. Small data sets present a dilemma. It is difficult to tell if the data come from a Gaussian population, but it matt! ers a lot. The nonparametric tests are not powerful and the parametric tests are not robust.</p></p><h2>Groucho And Me</h2><p><b>"An important contribution to the history of show business and to the saga of American comedy and comedians, comics and comicality."--James Thurber</b><br><br>With impeccable timing, outrageous humor, irreverent wit, and a superb sense of the ridiculous, Groucho tells the saga of the Marx Brothers: the poverty of their childhood in New York's Upper East Side; the crooked world of small-time vaudeville (where they learned to carry blackjacks); how a pretzel magnate and the graceless dancer of his dreams led to the Marx Brothers' first Broadway hit, <i>I'll Say She Is!</i>; how the stock market crash in 1929 proved a godsend for Groucho (even though he lost nearly a quarter of a million dollars); the adventures of the Marx Brothers in Hollywood, the making of their hilarious films, and Groucho's triumphant television series,<i> You Bet Your Life!</i> Here is the life and lunatic times of the great eccentric genius, Groucho, a.k.a.

Something had happened at Emanuel AME Church, the church of her youth in Charleston, South Carolina, and she knew her mother was likely in the church at Bible study. Even before she heard the news, her chaplain's instinct told her the awful truth: her mother was dead, along with two cousins. What she couldn't imagine was that they had been murdered by a white supremacist. Plunged into the depths of mourning and anger and shock, Sharon could have wallowed in the pain. Instead, she chose the path of forgiveness and hope - eventually forgiving the convicted killer for his crime.<br>In this powerful memoir of faith, family, and loss, Sharon begins the story with her mother, Ethel Lee Lance, seeking refuge in the church from poverty and scorn and raising her family despite unfathomable violence that rattled Sharon to her core years later; how Sharon overcame her own struggles and answered the call to ministry; and how, in the loss of her dear mother, Sharon has become a nationally known speaker as she shares her raw, riveting, story of losing loved ones to gun violence and racism.<br>Sharon's story is a story of transformation: How an anonymous hospital chaplain was thrust into the national spotlight, joining survivors of other gun-related horrors as reluctant speakers for a heartbroken social-justice movement. As she recounts her grief and the struggle to forgive the killer, Risher learns to trust God's timing and lean on God's loving presence to guide her steps. Where her faith journey leads her is surprising and inspiring, as she finds a renewed purpose to her life in the company of other survivors.<br>Risher has been interviewed by Time Magazine, Marie-Claire, Essence, Guardian-BCC Radio, CNN, and other media sources. She regularly shares her story on American college campuses and racial-reconciliation events. "To Forgive a Killer," her essay as told to Abigail Pesta published in Notre Dame Magazine, won the 2018 Front Page Award for Essay published in a Magazine, awarded by the Newswomen's Club of New York.</p><p>Rev. Sharon Washington Risher was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina. She heard the call to ministry in 2002 and left North Carolina to attend Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary, where she earned her Masters of Divinity degree. Sharon served as Staff Chaplain and Trauma Specialist at Parkland Hospital and as Associate Pastor for Congregational Care at Rice Chapel AME Church in Dallas, TX. <br><br>On June 17th, 2015, a horrific tragedy happened: Sharon's dear mother, Mrs. Ethel Lee Lance, was killed in Charleston at the Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, along with two cousins, a childhood friend, and the others murdered in that massacre. Since that time, Sharon has been an advocate for revising gun laws, and is a spokesperson for the grassroots advocacy groups Everytown Survivor Network and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. She has appeared on CNN, BBC Radio, Good Morning America, and CBS and has been interviewed or written for Time, Marie-Claire, Essence, Texas Monthly, Vogue, and VOX. Her advocacy work brought her to the White House, where she witnessed President Barack Obama sign executive orders pertaining to new gun laws. Sharon has shared her story of loss, forgiveness, racism and gun law reform with audiences across the United States. <br><br>Sharon has two grown children and enjoys reading, cross-stitching, growing tropical plants, listening to a variety of music and being a mother to her fur dog-child, Puff-Daddy.<br><br>Sherri Wood Emmons is a freelance writer and editor and has published three novels. She is a graduate of Earlham College and the University of Denver Publishing Institute. A mother of three, she lives in Indiana with her husband, two fat beagles, and four spoiled cats.Rev. Sharon Risher is not one to be timid in the face of injustice, suffering or controversy. Out of the anguish of her own unspeakable loss after her mother and cousins were gunned down in a church basement by an unapologetic white supremacist, Sharon takes us on the journey no one wants to go on. Her training as a minister and chaplain helps us understand the complex emotions that tormented her in the aftermath of such personal tragedy. In this can t-put-it-down page-turner, the author doesn't mince words in conveying what it means to work through such pain, anger, isolation, and fear, yet, in the end, she generously shares the hopeful lessons she learned so we can vicariously benefit from them. It takes extraordinary bravery to do what Sharon Risher has done by so candidly sharing her story and we should all be grateful to God and to her for it! This book is a gift to humankind. --Rob Schenck, author of <i>Costly Grace: An Evangelical Minister s Rediscovery of Faith, Hope, and Love</i> and subject of Abigail Disney s Emmy Award-winning documentary, The Armor of Light<br><br>For Such a Time as This is a beautiful, but bittersweet memoir of a woman of God facing the loss of her beloved family by gun violence. Rev. Risher is truly one that has been called to rise in faith as a conduit for love, acceptance, and forgiveness. Her story will forever stand as truth and compassion in America s shameful culture of hate and discrimination played out through gun violence. --Rep. Lucy McBath, member of the United States House of Representatives from Georgia's 6th congressional district, and author of <i>Standing Our Ground: The Triumph of Faith Over Gun Violence: A Mother's Story</i><br><br>When you read Reverend Sharon Risher's phenomenal life story, you will want to hug her, cry with her, laugh with her. She sweeps you up with her unstoppable spirit. Faith keeps her resilient in the face of tragedy, the unthinkable murder of her mother at a prayer meeting in church. She inspires you to overcome colossal hurdles and face life with gusto and humor...and forgiveness. --Abigail Pesta, award-winning journalist, author of <i>The Girls</i>, coauthor of <i>How Dare the Sun Rise</i></p><h2>Bodyminds Reimagined: (Dis)ability, Race, and Gender in Black Women&#39;s Speculative Fiction</h2><p>In <i>Bodyminds Reimagined</i> Sami Schalk traces how black women's speculative fiction complicates the understanding of bodyminds&#x2014;the intertwinement of the mental and the physical&#x2014;in the context of race, gender, and (dis)ability. Bridging black feminist theory with disability studies, Schalk demonstrates that this genre's political potential lies in the authors' creation of bodyminds that transcend reality's limitations. She reads (dis)ability in neo-slave&nbsp;narratives by Octavia Butler (<i>Kindred</i>) and Phyllis Alesia Perry (<i>Stigmata</i>) not only as representing the literal injuries suffered under slavery, but also as a metaphor for the legacy of racial violence. The fantasy worlds in works by N. K. Jemisin, Shawntelle Madison, and Nalo Hopkinson&#x2014;where werewolves have obsessive-compulsive-disorder and blind demons can see magic&#x2014;destabilize social categories and definitions of the human, calling into question the very nature of identity. In these texts, as well as in Butler&#x2019;s <i>Parable</i> series, able-mindedness and able-bodiedness are socially constructed and upheld through racial and gendered norms. Outlining (dis)ability's centrality to speculative fiction, Schalk shows how these works open new social possibilities while changing conceptualizations of identity and oppression through nonrealist contexts.</p><p>Sami Schalk is Assistant Professor of Gender and Women&#39;s Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&#x201c;In this smart and necessary book, Sami Schalk persuasively argues that black women's speculative fiction offers a rich archive of alternate framings of (dis)ability, race, sexuality, and gender that move us closer toward justice. <i>Bodyminds Reimagined</i> reveals how nonrealist representations can defamiliarize categories assumed to be self-evident, opening up new ways of thinking about methodology, trauma, metaphor, and politics. Schalk's work pushes all of us in feminist studies, black studies, and disability studies to reimagine how we understand minds and bodies moving though the world.&#x201d; -- Alison Kafer, author of, <i>Feminist, Queer, Crip</i></p><h2>S Is for Salmon: A Pacific Northwest Alphabet</h2><p>Nature is on full display in this beautiful ABC book: C is for Crab; D is for Douglas fir; and E is for Eagle.

Certainly no man has ever held the world championship longer &#x2014; 28 years &#x2014; or kept his powers so long. In his sixties, Lasker began what amounted to a fresh career in chess by playing his first serious game in ten years, and defeating Max Euwe, the man who was the following year to become world champion. The secret behind his extraordinary abilities may perhaps be found in Lasker&#x2019;s wide knowledge of every phase of the game, and his ability to be independent of schools or fashions.<br>This knowledge is reflected in the <i>Manual of Chess,</i> making it one of the great studies of the game, acclaimed by the chess world almost from the day it appeared. The book is one of the most thorough studies ever written, and though its main appeal is to the intermediate to skilled player, it begins its explanations at a level that can be understood by the beginner. Lasker analyzes basic methods of gaining advantages, exchange value of pieces, combinations, position play, the aesthetics of chess, and almost every other important aspect of the game. He examines dozens of different openings, including the Petroff Defense, the Hungarian Defense, King&#x2019;s Bishop, Ponziani, Giuoco Piano, and Four Knights&#x2019; Game. He constantly illustrates his discussions with games played by the great modern masters. Lasker is always delightful reading, revealing a mind as quick to entertain and philosophize as it is to explain.<br>One of the most rewarding features of the book is Lasker&#x2019;s illumination and elaboration of the theories of William Steinitz. An interesting sidelight is that although Lasker always thought of himself as a disciple of Steinitz, he was actually an original, more versatile player, inclined to take calculated risks. His exposition of Steinitz&#x2019;s thought and maxims, his principles of attack and evaluation, however, cannot help but be profitable to any chess player.</p></p><p>Emanuel Lasker (1868-1941) was the Second World Chess Champion. He held the title from 1894 until 1921 and is considered by many as the greatest chess player ever. Although his place in chess history would be secure without achieving anything else, in fact the three books he wrote, &#34;Lasker&#39;s Manual of Chess,&#34; &#34;Common Sense in Chess,&#34; and &#34;St. Petersburg 1909&#34; have all become chess classics.</p><h2>Studio: Jazz Drum Cookbook</h2><p>Enormous demands are placed on the control and manual dexterity of the contemporary drum set player, particularly in the Jazz idiom.

This means channeling resources into the right efforts, striking a balance between innovation and control, and getting everyone pulling in the same direction.<br><br>How to accomplish all this? Continually ask the right questions, advises Harvard Business School professor Robert Simons. By posing these provocative questions, you identify critical gaps in your strategy execution processes, focus on the most important choices you must make, and understand what's at stake in each one.<br><br>In this concise guide, Simons presents the seven key questions you and your team must regularly explore together:<br><br>�Who is your primary customer? Have you organized your company to deliver maximum value to that customer?<br><br>�How do your core values prioritize shareholders, employees, and customers? Is everyone in your company committed to those values?<br><br>�What critical performance variables are you tracking? How are you creating accountability for performance on those variables?<br><br>�What strategic boundaries have you set? Does everyone know what actions are off-limits?<br><br>�How are you generating creative tension? Is that tension catalyzing innovation across units?<br><br>�How committed are your employees to helping each other? Are they sharing responsibility for your company&#x2019;s success?<br><br>�What strategic uncertainties keep you awake at night? How are you riveting everyone's attention on those uncertainties?<br><br>These questions force you to reexamine the unspoken assumptions underlying your strategy and analyze how it's implemented through your business processes and structures. Simons' extensive examples then help you understand your options and make the tough choices needed for your company to excel at execution.<br><br>Drawing on decades of research into performance management systems and organization design, Seven Strategy Questions is a no-nonsense, must-read resource for all leaders in your organization.<br></p><p><br>Robert Simons is the Charles M. Williams Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. For twenty-five years, he has taught accounting, management control, and strategy implementation courses in the Harvard MBA and Executive Education programs.

Originally designed to accompany the <strong>Grammar for the Well-Trained Mind</strong> program, this Grammar Guidebook stands on its own, assembling into one handy reference work all of the principles that govern the English language&#x2015;from basic definitions (&#x201c;A noun is the name of a person, place, thing, or idea&#x201d;) through advanced sentence structure and analysis. Each rule is illustrated with examples drawn from great literature, along with classic and contemporary works of science, history, and mathematics.</p><p><strong>Grammar for the Well-Trained Mind</strong> is an innovative program that combines the three essential elements of language learning: understanding and memorizing rules (prescriptive teaching), repeated exposure to examples of how those rules are used (descriptive instruction), and practice using those rules in exercises and in writing (practical experience). Each year, parents and teachers go through the dialogue, rules, and examples in the <em>Core Instructor Text</em>; students follow along in the <em>Student Workbook</em>. This repetition solidifies the concepts, definitions, and examples in the student&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>There are four Student Workbooks, one for each year. Each <em>Student Workbook</em> contains the same rules and examples&#x2015;but four completely different sets of exercises and assignments, allowing students to develop a wide-ranging knowledge of how the rules and examples are put to use in writing. Each <em>Student Workbook</em> comes with its own <em>Key</em>, providing not only answers, but also explanations for the parent/instructor, and guidance as to when the answers might be ambiguous (as, in English, they often are).</p><p>All of the rules covered, along with the repeated examples for each, are assembled for ongoing reference in <strong><em>The Grammar Guidebook</em></strong>.</p><p>Use <strong>Grammar for the Well-Trained Mind</strong> to teach English grammar thoroughly, effectively, and with confidence&#x2015;no matter what your background or experience!</p><br></p><p>Susan Wise Bauer is a writer, educator, and historian.

Neusner explains why the Sermon on the Mount would not have convinced him to follow Jesus and why, by the criterion of the Torah of Moses, he would have continued to follow the teachings of Moses. He explores the reasons Christians believe in Jesus Christ and the Kingdom of Heaven, while Jews continue to believe in the Torah of Moses and a kingdom of priests and holy people on earth. This revised and expanded edition, with a foreword by Donald Akenson, creates a thoughtful and accessible context for discussion of the most fundamental question of why Christians and Jews believe what they believe.</p><p>Jacob Neusner is Distinguished Service Professor of the History and Theology of Judaism and Senior Fellow, Institute of Advanced Theology, Bard College.&#34;A tour de force and very, very moving.&#34; Jonathan Sacks, Chief Rabbi of Great Britain &#34;By far the most important book for the Jewish-Christian dialogue in the last decade. The absolute honesty, the precision of analysis, the union of respect for the other party with carefully grounded loyalty to one&#39;s own position characterize the book and make it a challenge especially to Christians, who will have to ponder the analysis of the contrast between Moses and Jesus.&#34; Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger &#34;Neusner here makes a contribution to Jewish-Christian understanding that is as lively as it is unusual ...

The sloping footpath leading up to the hospital was paved with gray cobblestones. My feet ached as my oversize leather sandals slipped on the rounded irregular rocks. The hospital was an old building browned by the passage of two centuries, with spidery cracks in its fa�ade. Founded in 1771, New York Hospital is the second-oldest hospital in the United States, a mecca for doctors and patients from all over the world. I had been in the building once before, six months ago, for a residency interview. I spun through a revolving brass door, nearly running into the burly security guard reading the New York Post. He looked up from the tabloid just long enough to point me in the direction of the elevator. <br>The tiled corridors were dark and dull, mixing shadow and light. <br>I darted past the chapel, past the caf�, around the information desk, which sat in the middle of the huge atrium like a fort, and entered a bank of elevators. Hanging on a wall was a portrait of a gray-haired lady in a blue dress sitting in dignified repose before an open book. She was a graduate of the medical school, class of 1899, ninety-nine years ago, who built a medical college for women in Northern India, on the banks of the Ganges, near where my father had his early college education. Nearby was a metal tablet in bas-relief: &#x201c;She cared for all in need. For each, she made time to guide, to teach, and to heal.&#x201d; <br>When I arrived on the fourth floor, other interns were still filing into the auditorium. A woman handed me a manila folder, and I went inside and sat down. The orientation packet contained several essential documents: a house-staff phone card, directions for obtaining autopsies, instructions on how to use the hospital dictation system, and the residency contract. I leafed through it quickly. My salary was going to be $37,000 a year, about eight dollars an hour, I calculated, given the number of hours I was going to be working, but I didn&#x2019;t mind. Though I was a year shy of thirty, it was more than double what I had ever made. <br>My classmates, though younger than I, appeared older than I expected, casually dressed, all thirty-five of them, in khakis and polo shirts, faded jeans and sequined tops. Some of them evidently knew each other, because they were already chatting in small, insulated groups. They were from some of the best medical schools in the country: Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Columbia. Though I too had gone to a top school&#x2014;Washington University in St. Louis&#x2014;I had been feeling insecure about the prospect of working with them. For months I had feverishly been reading Harrison&#x2019;s tome on internal medicine and review articles in The New England Journal of Medicine to prepare for this day. <br>Someone in the front row stood up and turned to face us. It was Shelby Wood, the hospital&#x2019;s residency director. He was a serious-looking man of medium build, with straight brown hair and a long, aquiline nose. He was wearing a white coat and a fat blue tie that might have been in fashion twenty years earlier. My elder brother, Rajiv, a cardiology fellow at the hospital, six years ahead of me in his medical training (though only two and a half years older), had warned me that Dr. Wood was a bit of a grouch, but had added that he was also fair and decent and a strong advocate for his house staff. Wood, I was to learn, hailed from the old school, where you were expected to live and breathe medicine, stay late in the hospital, neglect your family for the sake of your patients, and emerge on the other side a seasoned physician. <br>He cleared his throat and began to speak. His voice was deep but incongruously soft, and because I was sitting in the back of the sixty-seat auditorium, I only managed to catch snippets of his remarks. It was going to be a busy year, he said, as thirty-five heads stared motionlessly back at him. We were expected to devote ourselves fully to medicine. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t learn French by taking classes at Hunter College. You learn it by going to Paris, sitting in the caf�s, talking to people.&#x201d; Likewise medicine: we would learn it by living it. &#x201c;You are now ambassadors for the profession,&#x201d; he said gravely. &#x201c;So don&#x2019;t let the students hear you complain. It sets a bad example.&#x201d; If everything went as planned, he added, by next June we&#x2019;d be ready to supervise the next batch of <br>interns. <br>I glanced over at the pretty brunette sitting next to me. She looked back at me, rolled her eyes, and opened her mouth in mock panic. <br>Then Wood dropped the bomb. Every intern starting on the wards or in the intensive care units was required to come to the hospital every single day, including weekends, for the first six weeks. The only exceptions were interns starting in the outpatient clinic, which was only open from nine to six; they would have no evening call and weekends off for the first month. I later learned that this regimen was a long-standing tradition at the hospital, the most efficient way to get everyone up to speed. To me it seemed brutal, like a kind of hazing, not to mention a violation of residency work-hour limits set forth by the Bell Commission in New York in the mid-1980s. Uneasy murmurings reverberated through the auditorium as new interns rustled through their packets. I scanned the master schedule before breathing a sigh of relief. Along with six classmates, I was slated to start in the clinic. <br>&#x201c;We are here to help you,&#x201d; Wood said, raising his voice over the light chatter. &#x201c;You should feel free to call on us anytime, day or night. The only mistake you can make is not asking for help.&#x201d; <br>I was reminded of a residency interview in Chicago a few months earlier. The interviewer, a portly senior physician with an abundance of facial hair, had posed the following scenario: A nurse pages me in the middle of the night to tell me that a patient who just had hip surgery is short of breath. What would I do? &#x201c;Go see the patient,&#x201d; I said. I had enough sense to know that there was only one right answer to that question. Walking to the room, what would I be thinking about? &#x201c;Pulmonary embolism,&#x201d; I replied. Blood clots in the lung are a feared complication after hip surgery. When I arrive in the room, the patient is in distress. His heart is beating 130 times per minute and the oxygen tension in his blood is low. Now what? I went over the treatment options in my head&#x2014;blood thinner, supplemental oxygen, arterial blood gas&#x2014;but it seemed the examiner wanted me to say something else. I&#x2019;d heard about the notorious &#x201c;July phenomenon,&#x201d; in which hospital mortality supposedly increases every summer with the entry of new and inexperienced hospital staff. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d call a senior resident,&#x201d; I finally answered. Why? &#x201c;Because I could be missing something.&#x201d; My interviewer nodded; I had passed the test. Like all residency directors, he was looking for a soldier, not a cowboy. <br>Now it was late June, and we were the new hospital staff. For the rest of that first morning, we sat through a series of tag-team lectures. A woman from the blood bank talked about blood transfusions. A pathologist talked about the importance of autopsies. A psychologist spoke about work-related stress and told us that confidential counseling was available. A lawyer from risk management, the department that defended the hospital against lawsuits, informed us that at some point in our careers every one of us was likely to be sued, and that we could even be sued during residency. She offered some advice: Document your decision-making; document when a patient refuses treatment; never admit wrongdoing; never talk to an opposing attorney; and, finally, be nice to your patients. Doctors who were nice to their patients were rarely sued, even in cases of egregious malpractice. I looked around the room, trying to gauge the reaction of my classmates, frankly surprised that such a cynical thing was being taught on the first day of residency. No one&#x2019;s eyes met mine. <br>At the midmorning break, I went outside. Stepping through the humid air was like sweeping away static. The sidewalk was buzzing in a kind of Brownian motion, with pedestrians sidestepping me as though I were a moving obstacle. A long line snaked from an aromatic hot dog stand. Buses and taxicabs were letting people off in front of the hospital. An ambulance whizzed by on the main thoroughfare, sirens blaring, lights flashing. The noise fed my sense of wonder. I had grown up in a quiet Southern California suburb, craving the excitement of a big city. Berkeley and St. Louis had their pockets of vitality, but nothing like this. Even the smell of the neighborhood&#x2014;a mix of pizza, garbage, cigarette smoke, and fragrant fruit&#x2014;was rich and seasoned, like wisdom wafting through the air. <br>I had only arrived in Manhattan a few days earlier, moving into a one-bedroom apartment about a block away from the hospital. On the plane flight in from St. Louis, the pilot took a detour because of airspace congestion, he told us, flying into LaGuardia from the south, not the usual flight pattern. As we passed over the World Trade Center and then soared low over the city, I craned my neck to look down at the broad swath of Central Park. The brown buildings on its outskirts were arrayed like divers ready to jump into a pool. Down there, I had imagined, all of the metropolis&#x2019;s unique charms were waiting for me: the old, stained sidewalks; the stealthy characters playing junkyard instruments on subway platforms; the deliverymen hurtling through traffic lights on their rickety ten-speeds, i &#x2122; ny plastic bags swinging from the handlebars. The first time I had been to New York was the summer before medical school, when I spent a couple of weeks with my brother and his wife in their tiny one-bedroom apartment across the street from the hospital, where he had just begun his fellowship. I wandered around the city, going on walking tours of Harlem, joyriding on the subway, chatting with bartenders late into the night. Like many visitors to Manhattan, I was swept away. The delicatessens, the dry cleaners, the corner convenience stores and smoke shops. Unlike in Berkeley, people weren&#x2019;t just milling around, enjoying the sun. There was magic in the movement on the streets. So much was happening, and I could watch it all and remain a shadow. That was the wonderful paradox of Manhattan: you could be surrounded by people and yet be anonymous at the same time. &#x201c;The United Nations is just down the street,&#x201d; I wrote a friend. &#x201c;The building they use to broker world disputes, just down the street from me!&#x201d; New York cast a spell on me that summer that I could neither explain nor resist. <br>Back on the sidewalk, I felt a light spray from air-conditioning units outside the apartment windows above me. Heavy construction was going on in a lot nearby; large bulldozers were exhuming a deep hole, as if for a tomb, their blades ravenously picking up mouthfuls of yellowish dirt. I passed by an old church and stopped at a fruit stand to buy a nectarine. Then I ambled back to orientation munching on it. A plane flew overhead. Looking up at it streaking across the clear blue sky, sweet juice trickling down my chin and fingers, I couldn&#x2019;t help but think that the abnormal flight path that had brought me here last week was an apt metaphor for my own twisting journey into medicine. <br>I STOOD ON THE BALCONY in Berkeley and lit a cigarette. My bags were packed, the bills paid, the car loaded. Most of my possessions had been sold, save for some clothes and a few boxes of books, which I forced into the trunk and backseat. After a week of sleepless nights, I had turned in my Ph.D. thesis on quantum dots that morning. I had even found someone to take over my apartment. Now all I had to do was leave. <br>It was late in the afternoon on Tuesday&#x2014;August 1995&#x2014;and the sky over the shimmering San Francisco Bay had turned a smoky orange. Medical school orientation was starting tomorrow. I would be in a Honda Civic somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. After explaining to the dean that I was delayed finishing my physics thesis, she had urged me to at least try to make it to St. Louis by Friday morning for the white-coat ceremony and the recitation of the Hippocratic oath. After speaking with her, I looked it up: &#x201c;. . . To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug, nor give advice which may cause his death. Nor will I give a woman a pessary to procure abortion . . .&#x201d; Arcane stuff. Perhaps, I wondered, she&#x2019;d let me write my own oath. Perhaps that could be my first contribution to my medical education. <br>The air was warm, still, vaguely welcoming. The fraying eucalyptus trees in the backyard gave off a pungent fragrance. Taking a long drag, I felt buzzed, even a bit dizzy. For the first time in months, I was in the moment. But the carefree feeling quickly dissipated as the thought&#x2014;the same thought that had plagued me for months&#x2014;reentered my mind, even as I tried hard to resist it: What the hell are you doing? <br>I pulled out of the driveway and headed south toward the Berkeley campus one last time. I passed the International House, Sorority Row, and the dormitory where I had lived freshman year. Ice plant still lined the side of the road, and the landscaping was still immaculate, just as it had been a decade ago. Freshman year, I remembered, I had planned to major in history or political science, but Victor, my randy Russian roommate, had deterred me. He was a double major in math and physics. (And &#x201c;love,&#x201d; as he liked to put it. He put a mattress in our walk-in closet. Every night, moans from one of his girlfriends titillated me as I fell asleep.) Victor&#x2019;s enthusiasm for his chosen subjects was infectious. He lent me books on abstract algebra. He explained to me the wonderfully nonintuitive ideas of Kurt G�del, an Austrian logician who proved that all mathematical systems are necessarily incomplete. He told me about Ramanujan, the Indian mathematical prodigy who claimed that the Hindu goddess Namakkal whispered theorems about prime numbers to him in dreams. In freshman chemistry, when I had to memorize the rules for how electrons occupy atomic orbitals, Victor taught me where those rules came from, in a quantum-mechanical language that was both beautiful and inscrutable. The exactness, the inaccessibility, of quantitative science intoxicated me. In the social group I eventually joined, math and physics had prestige, a sort of intellectual exclusivity that was deeply appealing. The spectrum of talent in these subjects was so broad, much broader than in the social sciences or humanities or even the biological sciences, where it seemed that with enough study even the grade-conscious premeds could master the concepts. What separated me from the rest of the pack was what separated Victor from me, and what separated my friend Mike from Victor, and what separated the genius student David Moulton from Mike, and what separated the weird, stinky math professor who ambled around campus mumbling to himself from David Moulton, and probably what separated Einstein from the weird, stinky math professor. The brain function required was so specialized that math and physics seemed to me the truest tests of intelligence. So, by the end of my freshman year, my major had changed to physics, and my intellectual heroes had changed from Churchill and Gandhi to Einstein, Heisenberg, and Feynman, men who changed the world through the power of mathematics. <br>But by senior year it had become clear to me that theoretical physics, at least at the level I wanted to pursue it, was beyond my capabilities. So, like many of my friends who didn&#x2019;t know what to do with themselves, I took the LSAT and applied to law schools. Trial law had always interested me; in high school I often fantasized about leading a cour...</p><h2>First Aid for the Emergency Medicine Clerkship, Third Edition (First Aid Series)</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note:&nbsp;Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b><b><i></i></b></p><p></p><p></p><br><br><p><b>The emergency medicine clerkship survival guide in the super-effective First Aid format</b></p><p><b><i>Written by students who just completed their clerkship</i></b></p><p><i>First Aid for the Emergency Medicine Clerkship</i> is a comprehensive high-yield review based on the clerkship's core competencies.

He left at the age of eighteen on a scholarship to study in Germany. In the early 1990s, he interrupted his studies and went to Afghanistan to join al-Qaeda units fighting--with American support--the Soviet-backed government in Kabul. He returned to Germany in 1992, completing his engineering degree and living and working first in Germany and then, for a few months, in Montreal. After his November 2001 apprehension by a Jordanian commando team, he was held in isolation and interrogated for the next seven and a half months before they concluded he had had no involvement with the Millennium plot. Nevertheless, a CIA rendition team captured him and on August 5, 2002, he was incarcerated at Guantanamo. Despite being cleared by multiple courts and foreign governments, he remained imprisoned. He has never been charged with a crime.</p>''This is an incredible document, and a hell of a story.'' --Steve Kroft, correspondent for <i>60 Minutes</i><br><br>''Anyone who reads <i>Guantanamo Diary</i> - - and every American with a shred of conscience should do so, now--- will be ashamed and appalled. Mohamedou Ould Slahi's demand for simple justice should be our call to action. Because what's at stake in this case is not just the fate of one man who managed, against all odds, to tell his story, but the future of our democracy.'' --Glenn Greenwald, <i>No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State</i><br><br>''Here, finally, is the disturbing and stirring story the United States government tried for years to conceal. Mohamedou Ould Slahi's ordeal shocks the conscience, to be sure. But on display in these pages is something much deeper as well: an enduring faith in our common humanity, and in the power of truth to leap prison walls and bridge divides. With devastating clarity and considerable wit, <i>Guant�namo Diary</i> reminds us why we call certain things human rights.'' --Anthony Romero, Executive Director, American Civil Liberties Union<br><br>''A vision of hell, beyond Orwell, beyond Kafka: perpetual torture prescribed by the mad doctors of Washington.'' --John le Carr�<br><br>''Once considered such a high-value detainee that former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld designated him for 'special interrogation techniques'....Slahi had been subjected to sleep deprivation, exposed to extremes of heat and cold, moved around the base blindfolded, and at one point taken into the bay on a boat and threatened with death....Slahi faces no criminal charges.'' --Carol Rosenberg, <i>Miami Herald</i></p><h2>The Fabric of Faithfulness: Weaving Together Belief and Behavior</h2><p>Voted one of <em>Christianity Today</em>'s 1998 Books of the Year! All kinds of important choices are made during the college years. Young men and women explore what they really believe about the nature of the world and the purpose of life. They choose their work. They build friendships and often choose to marry. They develop goals and adopt habits that may last a lifetime. Yet late modernity is not a welcome environment for emotional, intellectual and spiritual formation. Society is increasingly fragmented. And the educational system itself, fragmented and specialized, may disintegrate more than it integrates. How do parents, professors, campus ministers, youth pastors and others help students, during one of the most eventful and intense periods of life, learn to connect what they believe about the world with how they live in it? Steven Garber vigorously engages just that question in this revised edition that includes a new chapter on what he has learned about lifelong formation in the years since the book first appeared. Drawing on the history of ideas, ethics, sociology and popular culture, he offers must-reading on the critical lifework of making sense of life.</p><p>Steven Garber is the principal of The Washington Institute for Faith, Vocation &amp; Culture, which is focused on reframing the way people understand life, especially the meaning of vocation and the common good.

He was a master of instrumentation and symphonic form, composing a total of nine symphonies. His most celebrated work, Symphony No. 9, "From the New World" (composed during Dvo&#x159;�k's three-year stay in America), echoes the folk spirit of his native Czechoslovakia as well as American influences, and is filled with the spontaneous melodic invention, rhythmic variety, and intensity of harmony that characterize his orchestral works.<br>The popular acclaim accorded the symphony "From the New World" tends to overshadow Dvo&#x159;�k's other symphonies, but <i>Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</i> notes the "interesting...form...folk-spirit...virile serenity" of Symphony No. 8. The delightful freshness and uninhibited emotionalism of the composition have contributed to its lasting success.

In <em>Eternal Life: A New Vision</em>, a remarkable spiritual journey about his lifelong struggle with the questions of God and death, he reveals how he came to a new conviction about eternal life. God, says spong, is ultimately one, and each of us is part of that oneness. We do not live on after death as children who have been rewarded with heaven or punished with hell but as part of the life and being of God, sharing in God�s eternity, which is beyond the barriers of time and space. spong argues that the discovery of the eternal can be found within each of us if we go deeply into ourselves, transcend our limits and become fully human. By seeking God within, by living each day to its fullest, we will come to understand how we live eternally.</p> <p>Always compelling and controversial, Spong, the leading Christian liberal and pioneer for human rights, wrestles with the question that all of us will ultimately face. In his final book, Spong takes us beyond religion and even beyond Christianity until he arrives at the affirmation that the fully realized human life empties into and participates in the eternity of God. The pathway into God turns out to be both a pathway into ourselves and a doorway into eternal life.

Edward, a "frightful boy," will not share any toys with his younger sister. When she touches something, he cries, "IT'S MINE. MINE. MINE!" Overcome by greed, he gets stuck in his tangle of toys and misses the opportunity for homemade fudge. Claire, not one to hold grudges, helps free her brother and shares her chocolate. After Edward apologizes profusely, the siblings spend the day playing happily. The rhyming text is pleasant but flawed. Edward's dramatic character shift is hard to believe, and one wonders why he doesn't shout "help" when his mother is nearby. Catrow's colorful, amusing illustrations are the highlight here. With every viewing, readers see additional delightful details, such as a blow-up Frankenstein doll drinking tea from a dainty cup and a cat whose stripes match the easy chair. The varying perspectives of the children and the toys add to the fun. Edward's sour, grumpy expressions are exaggerated and comical; children learning to share will belly laugh even as they see a reflection of themselves. Overall, this would be a good addition to early childhood collections.&#x2014;<i>Barbara Katz, Parish Episcopal School, Dallas, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Including more than 300 illustrations, accompanied by quotes from the artist that illuminate the passionate thinking behind the work, <em>Hockney&#x2019;s Pictures</em> shows the evolution and diversity of Hockney&#x2019;s paintings, drawings, watercolors, prints, and photography, confirming and reinforcing his position as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular living artists.</p> 325 illustrations, 277 in color</p><p>David Hockney is an English artist and is considered to be one of the most influential artists of the twentieth century.In a book with so few words, this quote from Hockney rings out clearly: "I have always believed that art should be a deep pleasure." And it is indeed pleasure that radiates from every page of this retrospective of the British-born artist's career. Starting with his student work of the early 1960s, Hockney has depicted quiet domestic pleasures, the faces of friends and the monuments of foreign countries with an unwavering joy in looking and seeing, even as he has employed a restless array of mediums, including oil, photo-collage, pressed paper pulp and quick, intimate watercolors. The accessibility of Hockney's art has earned him both popular success and jeers from some quarters of the art world that tend to favor "edginess" over happiness. This collection, which is compiled by the artist himself and includes his conversational commentary in the margins, not only gloriously documents Hockney's career, but also provides a riposte to those who see him as a shallow technician of pretty surfaces. The book is divided into sections that showcase Hockney's brainy engagement with the classic problems of modern art ("Problems of Depiction: Movement," "Space and Light"). The case for Hockney's seriousness may have come at the expense of his playful, mischievous side, however. There would have been more than enough material for an amusing section on the male rear end, for example, which has been as much of a Hockney theme as his famous preoccupation with water. But the book's theory-heavy arrangement is unobtrusive. There is only the briefest of introductory text, and captions are confined to titles and dates (full information on each picture is tucked away in an index). The art is allowed to speak for itself and the result is, once again, pure pleasure. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dunne (1866-1949) was an accomplished English aeronautical engineer and a designer of Britian's early military aircraft. His <em>An Experiment with Time,</em> first published in 1927, sparked a great deal of scientific interest in--and controversy about--his new model of multidimensional time.</p><p>A series of strange, troubling precognitive dreams (including a vision of the then future catastrophic eruption of Mt. Pelee on the island of Martininque in 1902) led Dunne to re-evaluate the meaning and significance of dreams. Could dreams be a blend of memories of past and future events? What was most upsetting about his dreams was that they contradicted the accepted model of time as a series of events flowing only one way: into the future. What if time wasn't like that at all?</p><p>All of this prompted Dunne to think about time in an entirely new way. To do this, Dunne made, as he put it,"an extremely cautious" investigation in a "rather novel direction." He wanted to outline a provable way of accounting for multiple dimensions and precognition, that is, seeing events before they happen. The result was a challenging scientific theory of the "Infinite Regress," in which time, consciousness, and the universe are seen as serial, existing in four dimensions.</p><p>Astonishingly, Dunne's proposed model of time accounts for many of life's mysteries: the nature and purpose of dreams, how prophecy works, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of the all-seeing "general observer," the "Witness" behind consciousness (what is now commonly called the Higher Self).</p><p>Here in print again is the book English playwright and novelist J.B.

Violence and bloodshed ensued, and the English soon found themselves embroiled alongside their Egyptian ally in a bitter conflict with the fiercely nationalistic Mahdi&#x2014;a conflict that culminated in the massacre of General Charles Gordon at Khartoum and the emergence of the fanatical regime known as the Dervish Empire.&nbsp;<br><br>In this illuminating volume, Churchill not only dramatically relates the catastrophic events in Sudan&#x2019;s 1880s, but also places them in the context of Sudanese history.

On a September morning when she is six, she wakes up and Ted is gone. Her parents explain that he went to the hospital for a while. "A while" turns out to be eight years in a plastic bubble, where he dies of a rare autoimmune disease at age seventeen. <br> <i>The Empty Room</i> is DeVita-Raeburn's unflinching, often haunting recollection of life with Ted, woven into a larger exploration of the enormous -- and often unacknowledged -- impact of a sister's or brother's death on remaining siblings. <br> With an inspired blend of life experience, journalistic acumen, and research training, DeVita-Raeburn draws on interviews of more than two hundred survivors to render a powerful portrait of the range of conditions and emotions, from withdrawal to guilt to rage, that attend such loss. Finding little in professional literature, she realizes that those who suffer are the experts. And in the end, it is DeVita-Raeburn and her experts who present a larger, more complex understanding of the sibling bond, the lifelong impact of the severing of that bond, and the tools needed to heal and move forward. <br> <i>The Empty Room</i> is a fascinating literary hybrid in which Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn seamlessly fuses deeply affecting remembrance with a pragmatic, lucidly written exploration of the healing journey.</p><p><b>Introduction</b><p>The movie <i>The Big Chill</i> begins with the death of a character you never meet, except for a few shots of his body being dressed for burial. As it turns out, this faceless individual is instrumental to the plot. His funeral brings his old circle of friends together, to relive the past and renegotiate the present in the wake of his absence. Each person must reconsider who he or she is, individually and within the group, because of his death. You never meet the man who has died, but you feel his absence, which is actually a presence of sorts. Director Lawrence Kasdan got something right here, something that resonates, about the aftermath of loss. </p><p>The death of someone you love forces you to reconsider who you are. It forces you to belong to a club to which no one wants to be a member, and to which just about everyone, save those who die young, eventually belongs. In her 1978 book, <i>Illness as Metaphor,</i> the writer and critic Susan Sontag writes: "Illness is the night-side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick." It's the same way with death. Or rather, being a survivor. Suddenly, ready or not, your membership is activated. It's your turn, it's your journey. What now?</p><p>This book is about my journey and the journey of those who have lost a brother or sister. In 1980, when I was fourteen, my only sibling, my older brother, Ted, died from a rare immune deficiency disease after an eight-year illness, during which he'd had to live in a sterile "bubble" room at The National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. His illness spanned a good portion of my childhood, long enough that it had become normal to me. I was devastated when he died. My life, my very identity, was shattered. But I wouldn't understand that for years. And I wouldn't fully explore my loss until I came to write this book. </p><p>The story of this book began eleven years after Ted's death. At the time, I was working as an editorial assistant at <i>The Washington Post,</i> answering phones, organizing supplies, begging to write small stories, and puzzling over what to do with my life. I'd gotten the job because my father, an oncologist, knew a patient who worked there. Journalism, while not my ambition, was deemed an acceptable form of writing by my parents, because it meant a paycheck. Except what I was doing wasn't really journalism. It was more like standing with my nose pressed against the window. And part of me was still toying with the idea of going to medical school. </p><p>I'd worked in medical research labs from the time I was fifteen until I was nineteen, labs run by one of my brother's former doctors. I was comfortable in the hospital; it felt like home. I knew sickness, death. They were, if not old friends, familiar companions. And a life outside the hospital, not engaged in crisis-saturated life-and-death issues, seemed meaningless. But the idea of being in the hospital for the rest of my life, confronted with a part of my life I also wanted to get past, also made me feel slightly hysterical. Trapped. What I really wanted was to be happy, to be normal. But I had no idea how to make that happen.</p><p>The line between what I felt I should do and what I wanted was hopelessly blurred. I frequently did things to pull the rug out from under myself, just to see if answers would become dislodged in the settling dust. Plus, though I craved normalcy, I was much more comfortable with stress and crisis. I found everyday sameness -- breakfast, lunch, dinner, work, bills, the gym -- unnerving. I struggled with the most mundane tasks. I struggled with relationships. I struggled with an eating disorder. I drank too much. I alternated among bravado, exhibitionism, insecurity, and my "invisible woman" routine. I could make myself so quiet that people missed me in rooms and backed into me in elevators. I observed a lot. I molded my reactions, my behavior, to those around me. I was a chameleon, an actress. I had no idea who I was. </p><p>By the time I was twenty-five and working at the <i>Post,</i> I was old enough to sense that I was both tough and fragile, but not old enough, or wise enough, yet, to know where and how. I abruptly quit my job (the pull-the-rug-out-from-under-myself routine) and called a veteran science writer I knew of. My latest plan was to combine writing with science; I could help people without sentencing myself to a future in the hospital. Calling someone you want a job from, and offering to buy them coffee, is the kind of advice that people give but never act on themselves. But I didn't know any better. Luckily for me, the woman I contacted was amused, and willing to meet. </p><p>I don't know how the subject of our brothers came up. She knew of mine because she was a reporter. In the pre-AIDS days of my brother's illness, before newspapers and magazines were rife with science and health stories, and before health and talk shows regularly trotted out people with rare medical afflictions, my brother's story had been big news. His story, and that of another boy, were combined for an unauthorized 1976 made-for-TV movie called <i>The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.</i> My family regularly got calls from newspapers, from the mainstream to the worst of the tabloids, wanting to write about Ted. <i>The National Enquirer</i> sent a photographer to his funeral. Though we don't get calls anymore, he and this other boy are still strange, abstract figures in American pop culture. Variations of the phrase "boy in the plastic bubble" have appeared in a Paul Simon song, on an episode of <i>Seinfeld,</i> in a movie satire of the first movie, and as the name of a board game.</p><p>This journalist told me she had a brother who died at an age close to my brother's -- seventeen -- of cystic fibrosis. Children with the disease have a better survival rate these days, but when her brother was sick, most didn't live to see their twenties. I don't remember exactly what she told me, or what I said in response. I only remember the eerie sense of resonance. All that time, I had thought I was the only one. I thought losing a sibling was my own strange story. I began to wonder if my struggles had been set in motion by my brother's illness and death. What struck me most, however, was that this woman treated the story of my brother as if it were mine to tell. As if, in fact, it had happened to me, too, and in a unique way. This was novel. Usually people asked me how my parents had gotten through it. She was the first to ask about me. Until then, I had not really been a figure in my own life story. </p><p>I began to change that day. Slowly, I started consciously to claim ownership of the events in my own life, events that, I was beginning to understand, had had a profound impact on every aspect of who I was. I began to let myself think that what had happened was not only my brother's famous story, or my parents' overwhelming tragedy, but my story, my loss, my tragedy, too. Separate. I began to unearth my feelings, long suppressed, about the loss of my only sibling, the older brother I'd adored. I began to see that my brother's illness and death, that my role as the healthy, surviving sibling, wasn't just some bizarre anomaly amid the rest of society's shared normalcy. I realized that I might be part of a group whose largely uncharted experience has had no name, no movement, no language. Sibling loss. </p><p>Our relationships with our brothers and sisters are key to understanding ourselves. Where they end and where we begin is often so seamless, the loss of a sibling can be a crippling blow to our understanding of who we are, and how we function and relate to others. I suspect that this holds true even in cases in which people have distant or troubled relationships with their brothers and sisters. "Closeness" is not, as we often presume, a prerequisite for connection, and the story of "intimate" relationships is not always a happy one. I've come to think of siblings as an actor might think of a backstory -- the imagined background of a character he's going to play. Those of us in the audience may never get a glimmer of a character's imagined history, but it's there all the same, informing that character's identity, behavior, and choices. Those of us who have siblings all have a "backstory."</p><p>It is, therefore, all the more perplexing to me that the loss of a sibling has long been considered less significant than other losses. It's only in the last twenty years that it has been recognized as a trauma approaching that of the loss of a parent or child. Still, except for the efforts of a handful of experts -- many of whom have lost a sibling themselves, and have been compelled to do research to answer their own questions -- this idea is not universally accepted. Though an estimated 25 percent of Americans have lost a sibling, sibling loss is overshadowed by the parents' loss of their child. In the case of adult siblings, it is overshadowed by the losses of the surviving spouses and children. </p><p>In greeting card stores across the country I have found, as often as not, bereavement cards for the loss of a parent, child, or pet, but not for that of a sibling. Hallmark, the leading manufacturer of greeting cards in this country since 1920, has always carried bereavement cards addressing the loss of parents, grandparents, and children, but did not start producing a sibling-specific line until the 1980s. When asked about my brother, I have repeatedly been faced with a well-intentioned person shaking his or her head sadly, saying, "That must have been terrible for your parents."</p><p>Why is the loss of a sibling such an overlooked experience? Maybe it has something to do with the pattern of infant and childhood mortality that preceded the availability of antibiotics and modern public health measures. At one time in our not-so-distant history, surviving infancy and childhood was something of a feat. Perhaps losing a sibling was, in those years, so common an event as to have become invisible, a given, and for that reason overlooked. Or perhaps, as some researchers have speculated, siblings are more ...</p>Alison Smith author of <i>Name All the Animals</i> <i>The Empty Room</i> is one of those quietly revolutionary books.

A political document of our times, Radical Son traces three generations of one American family's infatuation with the radical left from the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 to the collapse of the Marxist empire six decades later. David Horowitz was one of the founders of the New Left and an editor of Ramparts&#x2014;the magazine that set the intellectual and revolutionary tone for the movement. From his vantage point at the center of the action, he populates <i>Radical Son</i> with vivid portraits of people who made the radical decade, while unmaking America at the same time. We are introduced to an aged Bertrand Russell, the world-famous philosopher and godson of John Stuart Mill, who in his nineties became America's scourge, organizing a War Crimes Tribunal over the war in Vietnam. There is Tom Hayden, the radical everyman who promoted guerrilla warfare in America's cities in the sixties, married film legend Jane Fonda, and became a Democratic state senator when his revolutions failed. We meet Huey Newton, a street hustler and murderer who founded a black militia that became the Sixties' most resonant symbol of black power and black militance. Horowitz's encounter with Newton and his Black Panthers, the most celebrated radical group of the Sixties, becomes the focal point of the story when a brutal murder committed by the Panthers changes his life forever, prompting the profound "second thoughts" that eventually led him to become an intellectual leader of conservatism and its most prominent activist in Hollywood.</p><p>David Horowitz is a conservative thinker and writer who has authored dozens of books over the course of his lifetime. He began his political career as one of the founders of the New Left in the 1960s and served as an editor of its largest magazine,&nbsp;<i>Ramparts</i>. As described in this bestselling autobiography, Horowitz was forced to confront some difficult truths about the political left after a close friend of his was murdered by the Black Panthers, and ultimately found a political and intellectual home as a conservative activist."David Horowitz has written a vivid and compelling memoir in which it's the life as it was really lived that matters, not just the politics.&nbsp;<i>Radical Son&nbsp;</i>may be a 'generational odyssey,' but it's also a work of literature." Author: James Atlas, Author of "The Book Wars: What it Takes to Be Educated in America"<br><br><i>Radical Son&nbsp;</i>is one of the best political memoirs I've read. Though it is really a love story&#x2014;one man becomes passionately enamored with freedom, responsibility, and reason. Or maybe it's a book about faith healing, a true account of how belief in human dignity and individual rights cures blindness, folly, and hatred. Anyway, everyone who was ever involved with or influenced by the New Left should read David Horowitz's words, and then eat their own. I think the last political book that affected me this strongly was Hayek's&nbsp;<i>Road to Serfdom.</i>" Author: P.J. O'Rourke, Author of "Age and Guile Beat Youth, Innocence, and a Bad Haircut"<br><br>"David Horowitz's political pilgrimage from a Sixties radical to a Reagan conservative&#x2014;and the friends and enemies he has made along the way&#x2014;makes for a very interesting, very compelling story. Speaking as a conservative: it's much better to have David Horowitz with you than against you.&nbsp;<i>Radical Son&nbsp;</i>demonstrates why." Author: William J. Bennett, Author of "The Moral Compass"<br><br>"Watch out all of you statist shills and racialist hucksters out there who think you have gotten away with murder and mayhem over the last five decades, with alibis and applause from the media and the academy: David Horowitz has got your number and your jugular. In the first great American autobiography of his generation, this ardent writer on the ramparts remorselessly tracks them all down, going deep into the lairs of the professional liars of the left&#x2014;the guilty and the gulled, the sadistic and the philanderous, the vain and the vicious&#x2014;and strips away their tawdry veneer of glamour and idealism to reveal the vile truth&#x2014;about the Black Panthers and the rest of the revolutionary felons and felines, and finally, in gut-wrenching candor, himself."&nbsp; Author: George Gilder<br><br>"David Horowitz's powerful autobiography details a long journey from a boyhood in the ambit of American Stalinism through young adulthood at the vanguard of the New Left to a mid-life recognition that his various gods had failed. Horowitz's gift for irony and eye for detail haven't deserted him. His book is hard to put down."

Many know that the Revolutionary War&#x2019;s first martyr, Crispus Attucks, a dockworker of African descent, was killed at the Boston Massacre. But far fewer know that the final conflict of the war, the Battle of Yorktown, was hastened to a conclusion by James Armistead Lafayette, a slave and spy who reported the battle plans of General Cornwallis to George Washington. &nbsp;Author Nancy Sanders weaves the histories of dozens of men and women&#x2014;soldiers, sailors, ministers, poets, merchants, doctors, and other community leaders&#x2014;who have earned proper recognition among the founders of the United States of America. To get a better sense of what these individuals accomplished and the times in which they lived, readers will celebrate Constitution Day, cook colonial foods, publish a newspaper, petition their government, and more. This valuable resource also includes a time line of significant events, a list of historic sites to visit or explore online, and Web resources for further study.</p><p><strong>Nancy I. Sanders is the author of many books, including <i>A Kid&#x2019;s Guide to African American History</i> and <i>Old Testament Days</i>. </strong>Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;This activity-based guide reveals how African Americans played crucial roles in helping the United States gain its independence. Sanders includes well-known figures such as Phillis Wheatley, Crispus Attucks, and James Forten in her narrative, but also enriches traditional accounts of the period by explaining the contributions of lesser-known patriots. For example, she talks about black troops who fought at Bunker Hill and Valley Forge. She also tells the story of James Armistead Lafayette, a black soldier who spied on Benedict Arnold and Lord Cornwallis. Most of the activities help make this period real to young people. The "Explore Your Family Tree" project gives print and online resources that can help readers discover the roles their own ancestors may have played in the American Revolution. This book also includes information about how African Americans created social and political networks to support one another during the earliest days of the Republic. Sanders makes excellent use of primary sources, providing the original texts of documents and petitions that demanded equal rights and the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. She then explains these documents in language contemporary children will understand. A solid resource for teachers and librarians who wish to engage children in this formative period of American history.&#x2014;<i>Mary Landrum, Lexington Public Library, KY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Smart Publications, 1997), at a time when only a handful of clear thinking, knowledgeable doctors had ever heard about bio-identical hormones. Many women first learned the truth about HRT and BHRT from that first book; others later heard about it from TV celebrity Suzanne Somers, who described her personal experiences with a different version of BHRT in the first of a series of books. But the real stampede away from HRT and toward BHRT began in 2002 with the premature termination of a large, government-funded study-the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)-the results of which confirmed that the risks of conventional HRT unquestionably outweighed its benefits. In their new updated book, /Stay Young &amp; Sexy with Bio-Identical Hormone Replacement: The Science Explained/, authors Wright and Lenard have brought to light many examples of forgotten or ignored scientific studies combined with up-to-date clinical experience that provide solid support for the safety and benefits of BHRT.</p><p>Jonathan V.

They explain how these subtle energetic flows indicate the harmony or disharmony of the whole person and are greatly affected by physical traumas, chronic tensions, and unresolved emotions. For example, the psoas muscle, known in Taoism as the muscle of the Soul, connects the spine to the legs and is the first muscle to contract when anger or fear triggers our fight-or-flight response. Often a storehouse of subconscious stressors, this muscle&#x2019;s sensitivity is connected to many common ailments like back pain. <br> <br>Providing step-by-step illustrated exercise instructions, the authors explain how to identify and unwind energetic blockages and emotional and physiological knots. They explore emotional intelligence exercises for tuning in to our hearts so we can listen to our bodies&#x2019; messages and learn to relieve related emotional burdens. They also reveal how to activate the cranial, respiratory/cardiac, and sacral pumps of the three tan tiens to optimize the body&#x2019;s energetic flow and explain how, when our energy is flowing freely, we can enter the Cosmic Flow--a state of calm well-being and extraordinary creativity where we find ourselves truly at one with the universe.</p><p>Mantak Chia, world-famous Inner Alchemy and Chi Kung master, founded the Universal Healing Tao System in 1979.

The question is, will Harry&#x2019;s state of mind keep him from seeing it, and will his actions lead him into direct conflict with the wizard who&#x2019;s depending on his help?</p><p>LIBRARY JOURNAL (STARRED) -- Harry Dresden, Chicago's wizard for hire, has had a hard time of it lately. Facing down powerful enemies is finally taking its toll, and the flame of his anger is growing daily, fanned by guilt and loss. During this low point, a senior member of the White Council of Wizards, Listens To-Wind, asks Harry to help investigate a string of brutal murders in rural Mississippi. As the case gets under way, an unknown law enforcement group wants Harry and Listen To-Wind out of the way, and the Dog Men, thought to be the culprits in the killings, are not who they seem. Meanwhile in the town, a strong force of ghouls has gone undetected, until now. Ultimately, Dresden has to temper his rage and convince the Dog Men to help him battle the ghouls, otherwise they are all doomed. Complementing the text from Butcher (<i>The Cinder Spires</i>) and Powers (<i>G.I. Joe</i>; <i>Drafted</i>), artists Galindo (<i>Red Sonja</i>) and Mohan (<i>Dean Koontz's Frankenstein</i>) create stunning illustrations, every panel and page more exciting than the last. A slow start picks up to a heart-pounding pace that wraps up nicely.<br><b>Verdict</b> Butcher's many fans will not be disappointed with the action, and readers need no prior familiarity with &#x201c;The Dresden Files&#x201d; to enjoy this first volume in a stand-alone graphic series (collects six single issues). Highly recommended for older teens and adults.-Laura McKinley, Huntington P.L., NY<br></p><h2>The Jesus Hoax: How St. Paul&#39;s Cabal Fooled the World for Two Thousand Years</h2><p><p>Jesus of Nazareth is one of the most famous men in history. There are good reasons to believe that he walked the earth some two thousand years ago, and was eventually crucified.</p><p>But what about Jesus Christ, son of God? What if <em>he</em> never existed? What if the divine, virgin-born, resurrected Jesus Christ was a myth, a lie--even a hoax? That would have huge implications for modern-day Christianity; it would mean that there is a gigantic falsehood at the core of the religion of some two billion people.</p><p>In this book, Dr. David Skrbina presents a profound and stunning theory: that St. Paul and a band of friends constructed a 'Jesus hoax.' They took a kernel of truth based on Jesus, the man, and turned him into the divine savior of humanity. They did so as a way to strike back at the hated Roman Empire, and to undermine its strength among the common people. The absolute lack of corroborating evidence for the so-called biblical Jesus, and the fact that key documents such as the four Gospels were written decades after his time, all support this theory.</p><p>Everyone, regardless of religious belief, needs to be aware of this astonishing story. This is not just ancient history; it has vast implications for many areas of modern life.</p></p><p>David Skrbina, PhD is a philosopher and writer, with over 15 years experience as a lecturer at the University of Michigan, Dearborn.<p>Stunning, shocking, yes, world-changing. Never before has anyone put together such a succinct and well-grounded case for Jesus as a fictional character, a hoax, designed to deceive the masses. Concise and to the point, Skrbina minces no words: the biblical Jesus almost certainly did not exist. Biblical clues, historical evidence, and common sense all argue in support of this view. A fascinating read.</p><p>--- Kirkus Reviews</p></p><h2>Get Big Things Done: The Power of Connectional Intelligence</h2><p><p>Connectional Intelligence unlocks the 21st-century secret to getting "big things done," regardless of who you are, where you live, or what you do.</p><p>We typically associate success and leadership with smarts, passion and luck.

(<i>The Association for Science Education</i>)<br><br>One Minute Mysteries: 65 Short Mysteries You Solve With Science! is a wonderful resource for teachers who want to provide real-life math problems for their students. Each story problem is conveyed in a one-page format that asks the reader to draw a conclusion. The stories provide an insightful look into how math can be applied in the real world. Problems include discovering how much it would cost to either replace a book at the library or pay the late fees; the score you would need to win a gymnastics meet; and how to modify a recipe to accommodate a large group of people. Bonus sections include five extra math mysteries and five science mysteries. Most of the problems require higher-order thinking and may be difficult for students to complete independently. My sixth-grade classes worked in small groups with this book, which helped the students work toward a solution. Some of the stories are slightly fanciful, but they are completely math based and do not lend themselves to giving students the answer. I believe that the book would have been more coherent and beneficial for teachers if the stories had been better organized. Rather than arranged by story line, the stories could have been organized by concept (i.e., algebraic reasoning, geometry, probability, and so on). Overall this book can provide intriguing, useful, and challenging problems for a variety of students. (Jennifer G.

The first inmate reached the Death House on October 29, 1907. Six weeks later he was dead, his slumped body shaved and sponged down with salt water, the better to conduct the electricity. New Jersey continued to hang capital offenders for two more years. But soon enough the electric chair, with its wooden body, leather straps, and metal-mesh helmet, which discharged three mortal blasts of up to 2,400 volts, was seen as the most felicitous form of execution. <br> At least one infamous death gave the site a brief aura of celebrity. Richard Bruno Hauptmann, convicted of murdering Charles Lindbergh's baby, was electrocuted in the brightly lit chamber at 8:44 p.m. on April 3, 1936. In later years, sentences were carried out at 10 p.m., after the "general population" prisoners had been placed in total lockup. An outside power line fed the chair to ensure that a deadly jolt did not interfere with the penitentiary's regular lighting. On occasion, "citizen witnesses" crowded into a small green room, with only a rope between them and the chair about ten feet away. The observers watched the executioner turn a large wheel right behind the seated man's ear, thereby activating the lethal current. The body, penitent or obdurate, innocent or guilty, alive or dead, pressed against the restraints until the current was shut off. <br> The Death House confronted its own demise in 1972, when the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed the death penalty as cruel and unusual punishment. The electric chair, having singed the breath from 160 men, was suddenly obsolete. So prison officials found a new mission for the chamber: it became the Visiting Center. <br> Despite its macabre history, the VC was a huge hit with most of the prisoners. It marked the first time that Trenton State Prison, a maximum- security facility, had allowed contact visits. Inmates could now touch their spouses, children, or friends. The metal bars were removed from more than two dozen Death Row cells near the archaic chair, its seven electric switches still in place. The rooms were not exactly cozy hideaways, but they became the unsanctioned venue for conjugal meetings. Inmates seeking a bit of privacy tried to reserve cells farthest away from the guards, and the arrangement, as described by some old-timers, gave rise to Death House babies. <br> But Rubin Carter didn't care a bit. He refused to accept virtually anything the prison offered, and that included visits inside the reincarnated Death House. <br> He was repulsed by the prospect of sharing an intimate moment among the souls of 160 men, some of whom he knew. Transforming this slaughterhouse into a visiting center, Carter believed, was like turning Auschwitz or Buchenwald into a summer camp for children. It was another way for the state to humiliate prisoners, to express its contempt for the new law that pulled the plug on its chair. <br> Carter knew well that he could have been one of the chair's immolations. In 1967 he had been found guilty of committing a triple murder in Paterson, New Jersey. He adamantly claimed his innocence. The state sought the death penalty, but the jury returned a triple-life sentence instead. That conviction was overturned in 1976, but Carter was convicted of the same crime again later that year and given the same triple-life sentence. <br> By the end of 1980, Carter had gone for almost four years without a contact visit. Since his second sentencing in February of 1977, he had not seen his son or daughter, his mother, his four sisters, or his two brothers. Most of his friends were also shut out. He and his wife had divorced. He saw his lawyers in another part of the prison. <br> But now, on the last Sunday of the year, Carter had a visitor as the result of an unusual letter he'd received three months earlier. As a former high-profile boxer who was known around the country and even the world, he received hundreds of letters each year, but he rarely answered them. In fact, he didn't even open them, allowing them to pile up in his cell. Carter wanted nothing to do with the outside world. <br> Then came a letter in September, his name and prison address printed on the envelope. Carter could never explain why he opened it except to say that the envelope had vibrations. The letter, dated September 20, 19800, was written by a black youth from the ghettos of Brooklyn who, oddly enough, was living in Toronto with a group of Canadians. The seventeen-year- old, Lesra Martin, wrote that he had read CCCCCarter's autobiography, The Sixteenth Round, written from prison in 1974, and it helped him better understand his older brother, who had done time in upstate New York. Lesra concluded the letter: All through your book I was wondering if it would have been easier to die or take the shit you did. But now, when I think of your book, I say if you were dead then you would not have been able to give what you did through your book. To imagine me not being able to write you this letter or thinking that they could beat you into giving up, man, that would be too much. We need more like you to set examples of what courage is all about! <br>Hey, Brother, I'm going to let it go. Please write back. It will mean a lot. <br>Your friend, Lesra Martin Lesra's words, his efforts to reach out, touched Carter. He responded on October 7. The one- page typewritten note thanked Lesra for his "outpouring of hope, concern and humanness . . . The heartfelt messages literally jumped off the pages." More letters followed between Lesra, his Canadian guardians - who had essentially adopted the youth to educate him - and Carter in which they discussed politics, philosophy, Carter's own case, and his appeal. But when Lesra asked if he could visit the prison at Christmastime - he was going to be in Brooklyn seeing his family - Carter replied noncommittally. That did not deter Lesra. The bond between the two - and, more important, between Carter and this mysterious Canadian commune that typically shunned friendships with the outside world - had been sealed. <br> Winter's chill could be felt inside the Trenton State Prison on that last Sunday of December. Built in 1836 by the famed British architect John Haviland, the prison is a brooding, monolithic fortress. Haviland used trapezoidal shapes and austere giganticism to evoke a massive Egyptian temple. Scarab beetles, which symbolized the soul in ancient Egypt, were carved into the prison's pink limestone walls. Tributaries from the Delaware River flowed in front of the prison, in faint mimicry of the Nile. <br> But by 1980 the waterways had long since dried up and the pink limestone had turned brown. Loops of razor-ribbon wire topped twenty-foot-high concrete walls, and stone-faced guards stood in gun towers. The prison yard, with a softball field, weight machines, and handball courts, was said to sit over a cemetery. The yard's red dirt was so dry that it was regularly sprayed with oil, creating a viscous sheen that rubbed off on inmates in crimson splotches. <br> While the prison sought total control of its inmates, Carter defied the institution at every turn. He did not wear its clothes, eat in its mess hall, work its jobs, or participate in any organized activity. He refused to meet with prison psychiatrists, attend parole hearings, or carry his prison identification card. His rationale was simple: he was an innocent man; therefore, he would not be treated like a criminal. His defiance earned him several trips to a subterranean vault known as "the hole," where inmates were held in solitary confinement. He was also once banished to a state psychiatric hospital, where the criminally insane and other incorrigibles were disciplined. <br> But Carter had a predatory instinct for survival, and he was eventually allowed to live quietly in his fourth-tier cell. He continued to fight for his freedom in the courts, but by now he had immersed himself in books on philosophy, history, metaphysics, and religion. Searching for meaning in his own life, he turned his cell into "an unnatural laboratory of the human spirit." He studied, wrote, and tutored other inmates about the need to look within themselves to find answers to the world outside. <br> Carter had been on this personal journey for more than two years by the time a guard came to his cell and told him he had a contact visitor. Suspecting it was the letter-writing youth, Carter walked down his tier, through the center hub of the prison, and past the infirmary, which was conveniently next to the Death House. (The infirmary used to receive the electrocuted bodies.) Before entering the Death House, he gritted his teeth and disrobed for a strip search - standard procedure for every prisoner before and after a contact visit. Searching for contraband, a guard ran his hand through Carter's hair and looked inside his mouth, under his arms, beneath his feet, and up his rectum. This degrading invasion was another reason Carter avoided contact visits. <br> Once inside the chamber, Carter reserved a cell on the lower tier, placing his plastic identification tag and a pack of Pall Malls on two chairs. The prison visitors soon filed in and quickly joined their friend or loved one. Finally, only two people were left - Carter and a slip of a youth. The young man was trembling. <br> Growing up in the slums of Brooklyn, Lesra Martin knew plenty of people who had gone to prison, but this was his first time inside a pen. The high stone walls, metal gates, and claustrophobic corridors were imposing enough, but the brusque security checks were even more unnerving. He emptied his pockets, was frisked, was scanned by a hand-held metal detector, and had his right hand stamped with invisible ink. He had brought a package of Christmas cards, socks, and a hat from his Canadian guardians but was not allowed to deliver it because all packages have to come through the mailroom, where they are opened and inspected. Lesra registered and was given a number, but as he passed through the prison in single file, he was jarred by the guards' shrill orders. <br> "Get back in line!" "Don't speak to the person in front of you!" "Have your ID ready!" "Put your things in your locker!" As Lesra stood in the waiting room, he finally heard "four-five- four-seven-two, up!" That was Carter's prison number. Lesra waited before a dim holding bay. As the steel doors opened and visitors began walking in, several women took deep breaths while others held hands. A guard checked the right hand of each visitor with a blue fluorescent light. After about twenty people filed in, the guard yelled, "Bay secure!" The doors shut, and there was a long moment of helplessness, of captivity. Then doors on the other side opened, and everyone moved out. The experience dazed Lesra, who had arrived wanting to cheer up a prisoner but was made to feel as if he had done something wrong himself. <br> Rubin Carter understood the feeling. <br> "You must be Lesra," Carter said. He saw a frightened but goodlooking young man about six inches shorter than he. (Carter was only five foot eight.) The prisoner's appearance stunned the teenager. Every picture Lesra had seen of Carter showed him with a clean-shaven head, a thick goatee, and a menacing stare. Now he had a full Afro, a mustache, and a smile. The two embraced, then walked to the cell Carter had reserved. They sat facing each other and leaned forward so passing guards could not hear their conversation. <br> Lesra recounted his harrowing experience getting to the Visiting Center. "How do you survive in here?" he asked. <br> "I don't acknowledge the existence of the prison," Carter said. "It doesn't exist for me." Lesra noticed that the guards patrolling the corridor did not walk as closely to their cell as to other cells, giving them a bit more privacy as a sign of respect. Lesra also heard inmates as well as guards refer to Rubin as "Mr. Carter." When Lesra called him "Mr. Carter," he laughed. "You can call me Rubin, or better yet, Rube." As the inmate explained his refusal to participate in prison activities, Lesra remembered the words of Bob Dylan's song "Hurricane," which had been released in 1975 amid an outpouring of celebrity support: <br> <br>But then they took him to a jailhouse Where they tried to turn a man into a mouse. <br> <br> The jailhouse, Lesra realized, had failed. <br> He described how he left his home in Bedford- Stuyvesant and moved to Toronto, where his new Canadian family was educating him. The arrangement puzzled Carter, and he told Lesra he need not worry about being alone. "I know they're treating you well because of your smile, but if you're ever not happy there, you let me know," he said. The young man gave him the phone number to his home in Canada. <br> About an hour passed. As the visit was about to end, a prisoner who had a Polaroid camera approached them. <br> "You like me to take a picture of you and your son, Mr. Carter?" "Absolutely!" he responded. <br> Lesra turned and began walking toward a wall that he believed would make a fine backdrop. Carter yanked him back. <br> "We don't go that way," he said. "That's where the chair was." The electric chair had been removed a year or so earlier and was now in the Corrections Department Museum in Trenton. But the bolts were still in the ground, and the imprint of the chair was visible. The picture was taken against a different wall, with the two standing next to each other, smiles creasing their faces, Carter's arm draped across Lesra's shoulders. <br> As the two walked toward the holding bay, Lesra said, "I wish I could just walk you right on out." "Don't worry," Carter said. "I'm with you." This encounter marked the beginning of Carter's reemergence from his self-imposed shell. He would always have a special bond with Lesra, but he would develop far more important ties with the Canadian commune, and its members would provide vital support on Carter's journey through the federal courts. At the same time, the group's strong-willed leader, Lisa Peters, and Carter would become intense but doomed soulmates in an unlikely prison love affair. But all that was in the future. After his visit to the Death House, Carter returned to his cell, lay down on his cot, and stared at the picture of Lesra and himself. <br> <br>Copyright (c) 2000 by James S. Hirsch.

But alongside these encouraging signs, Thomas Shapiro argues in <em>The Hidden Cost of Being African American</em>, fundamental levels of racial inequality persist, particularly in the area of asset accumulation--inheritance, savings accounts, stocks, bonds, home equity, and other investments. Shapiro reveals how the lack of these family assets along with continuing racial discrimination in crucial areas like homeownership dramatically impact the everyday lives of many black families, reversing gains earned in schools and on jobs, and perpetuating the cycle of poverty in which far too many find themselves trapped.<br> Shapiro uses a combination of in-depth interviews with almost 200 families from Los Angeles, Boston, and St. Louis, and national survey data with 10,000 families to show how racial inequality is transmitted across generations. We see how those families with private wealth are able to move up from generation to generation, relocating to safer communities with better schools and passing along the accompanying advantages to their children. At the same time those without significant wealth remain trapped in communities that don't allow them to move up, no matter how hard they work. Shapiro challenges white middle class families to consider how the privileges that wealth brings not only improve their own chances but also hold back people who don't have them. This "wealthfare" is a legacy of inequality that, if unchanged, will project social injustice far into the future. <br> Showing that over half of black families fall below the asset poverty line at the beginning of the new century, <em>The Hidden Cost of Being African American</em> will challenge all Americans to reconsider what must be done to end racial inequality.<br></p><p><br><strong>Thomas M. Shapiro</strong> is Pokross Chair of Law and Social Policy, Heller School of Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University. <em>Black Wealth/White Wealth</em>, which he wrote in collaboration with Melvin Oliver, received widespread acclaim and won several awards, including C. Wright Mills award, the American Sociological Association Distinguished Scholarly Award, and The Myers Center Award for Human Rights.<br><p> African Americans often seem cut off from the economic mainstream. They face higher risks of poverty, joblessness and incarceration than their fellow citizens do. Community organizing, civil rights legislation, landmark court decisions and rising education have advanced the cause of racial equality. Overt bigotry has been banished from public places, and polls show that whites harbor fewer prejudices than they used to. But these improvements have not been enough.</p><p>How can disadvantage persist so long after most laws, minds and practices have changed? Thomas M. Shapiro argues in this sober and authoritative book that we should look to disparities of wealth for the answer. Whites are wealthier than African Americans, and whites' wealth advantage is much bigger than their advantages in either income or education (the point of Shapiro's earlier study, Black Wealth/White Wealth, co-authored with Melvin Oliver). Whites start out ahead because they inherit more from their parents, and America's racially segregated housing markets boost whites' home equities, while depressing those of African-American families. Shapiro, a professor of sociology at Brandeis, takes readers through the implications of these inequities and concludes that African Americans will not gain significant ground in the wealth divide until inheritance and housing policies change.</p><p>Wealth is the sum of the important assets a person or family owns -- home equity, pension funds, savings accounts and investments. Wealth is better than income because it is durable. People use income to meet daily expenses, whereas wealth accumulates. People who have wealth tap it only to deal with emergencies or to take advantage of opportunities -- opportunities that usually build more wealth.</p><p>Wealth passes down from generation to generation. The main reason African Americans are currently worse off than whites, according to Shapiro, is that today's African Americans inherited less wealth from their parents than today's whites did. It is not hard to see why: The generation of African Americans now passed away accumulated less wealth because discrimination in their day kept most of them poor and denied them opportunities other Americans enjoyed.</p><p>The disparity in wealth not only persists, it mushrooms. Without a cushion of inherited wealth, emergencies hit harder, and people who have no nest egg have to let opportunities pass by. Because of the wealth deficit, African Americans find themselves more vulnerable to shocks and less able to capitalize on breaks than whites with the same income. So the next generation will inherit less, too. The wealth gap will not close anytime soon.</p><p>Shapiro blends statistical analysis and case studies of selected families in Boston, St. Louis and Los Angeles, showing the relative importance of wealth and the disparities in inheritance by class and race. He also supplies some individual case studies, which give depth and humanity to the numbers.</p><p>Wealth begins at home. A home-equity loan can see a family through a spell of unemployment or leverage an investment. Millions of middle-class Americans use tax-deductible home-equity loans to pay for their children's educations. Others buy rental property.</p><p>Because neighborhoods are racially segregated, African Americans' homes do not grow in value as fast as whites' homes do. Shapiro calculates that housing segregation costs African Americans tens of thousands of dollars in home equity. Homebuyers look for amenities commonly found in predominantly white neighborhoods. They pay extra for parks, convenient shopping and attractive views. Parents pay huge premiums for what they perceive to be good schools. Few parents can judge schools objectively. Instead, they use easy-to-observe markers, including the race of the students. These preferences raise the costs that first-time homebuyers face when they attempt to buy houses in those mostly white neighborhoods. Economic theory implies that if whites continue to waste money on irrational prejudices like this, market forces will eventually undo the racial disparity in wealth. But the experience of the last 50 years suggests otherwise. Inequality has grown because each new generation has been willing to pay a higher premium for these amenities. The market doesn't punish discrimination; it rewards it.</p><p>Whites fail to see any injustice in these differences. Shapiro's interviews convinced him that whites hide their privilege from themselves and, accordingly, feel no guilt for the hidden costs they impose on African Americans. People who inherited tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars nonetheless told Shapiro that they were self-made and self-reliant. They proudly told him how the assets they inherited grew under their stewardship. White parents use wealth to send their children to private schools or to give their adult children down payments for homes. They do not see how such practices hand today's inequalities on to the next generation.</p><p>Shapiro argues convincingly that these private matters spill over into public investment, too. He interviewed one upper-middle-class woman who told him that she was unconcerned with troubles in the local public school because she never intended to send her children there. Shapiro points out that her indifference -- and that of others like her -- is just one more obstacle in the path of people trying to improve local public education.</p><p>Families and generations are at the core of Shapiro's analysis. So I was surprised that he did not directly address how marriage and family structure fit into the cycles of accumulation, inheritance and investment. Married couples accumulate more wealth than single parents do, according to other researchers. That suggests to me that African-American family issues must play a role in the wealth gap.</p><p>Shapiro does connect the wealth gap to public policy. Today's tax law exacerbates the inequality of wealth in the United States. Coming out of World War II, the federal government encouraged home ownership for all and increased the country's rate of homeownership from 44 percent in 1940 to 62 perent in 1960. (It inched up to 68 percent in 2003.) Since 1982, national tax policy has turned conservative in ways that foster what Shapiro labels "opportunity hoarding." He floats several proposals -- such as overhauling inheritance laws -- that might help the country get back on the track of broadening opportunity. Few of his proposals may be tried in the current political climate, where far more pressure goes toward abolishing inheritance taxes altogether. Yet by giving such a frank and probing appraisal of the long-term damage wrought by unequal wealth, Shapiro continues to press the case for resolving America's most stubborn and profound source of racial division. </p><p> </p><p>Reviewed by Michael Hout</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

A hairy, barrel-chested, fortysomething guy with gold chains, a mean grimace, and a stack of papers in a folder stared down at me.<br><br> He asked, "Are you Rand Fishkin?"<br><br> I was twenty-five years old, disoriented by his arrival, intimidated by his appearance and tone, and utterly panicked. I'm usually a terrible liar, so was taken aback by how quickly a response left my mouth:<br><br> "Sorry, I don't think he's here."<br><br> We exchanged a few more words, but I remember none of them. My heart was pounding. I hated lying, but I also had no idea what might happen if I identified myself. Matt just put on his headphones and pretended to be engrossed in whatever website he was working on. When the extra from The Sopranos left, I called Gillian, president of our three-person firm (who also happens to be my mom). I told her about the unexpected visitor. She guessed he was a debt collector, sent by one of the firms to whom a bank had sold our debt.<br><br> Oh, right. The debt. The $500,000 we owed, in my name, to finance our struggling consulting business.<br><br> Ten minutes after I returned to my apartment (actually, Geraldine's apartment-I was unable to pay my half of rent with my sometimes tiny, sometimes nonexistent paychecks, and couldn't pass a credit check, either), I heard a knock on the door. Assuming it was Geraldine carrying something she didn't want to put down to turn the key, I opened up without looking through the peephole.<br><br> It was the debt collector.<br><br> "Ha! Gotcha," he said.<br><br> I was mute.<br><br> "You're pretty good, kid. I totally bought that act today. . . ."<br><br> Scared senseless, I just stared at him.<br><br> He handed me the folder of papers I'd seen in his hands earlier and said, "Rand Fishkin, you've been served."<br><br> I couldn't even reach out to take them. He dropped them on the ground and walked away.<br><br> Oops, I Accidentally a Startup<br><br> In the summer of 2000, I was twenty-one with a year of college to go at the University of Washington in Seattle. I'm one of those lucky kids whose parents paid his tuition so he could "focus on his studies, not on work."<br><br> That is, until I got into a fight with my dad and he threatened to cut me off. I was too prideful and stubborn to back down, apologize, or reconcile, so, for the next two quarters, I had to pay my own way.<br><br> I worked part-time at the Wizards of the Coast Game Center, a giant arcade, gaming events center, and retail shop around the corner from campus. My $4.75/hour salary was supplemented by buying Pok&#x17d;mon cards with my employee discount and reselling them on eBay and Craigslist for a tidy profit. I designed and built a few websites on the side for some extra cash. And, thankfully, in the early 2000s, college tuition hadn't yet skyrocketed past the point of absurdity. A full quarter, including books, only cost around $3,000-a sum I scraped together while still managing to have enough to go out to the movies, buy the occasional used video game, and pay the rent on my small, shared apartment.<br><br> But two classes away from graduating, I threw in the towel. Part of it was the cost, part of it was the lack of value I perceived from school, but a lot of it was because of a failed romantic relationship (long distance + breakup = broken heart). I wish I could say entrepreneurship was the catalyst for dropping out, but the truth is the other way around. I wallowed in a little self-misery, watched a lot of X-Files reruns, and only then realized I needed something to do besides work retail. Web design was my path of least resistance.<br><br> In 1981, my mom, Gillian, started a marketing consultancy in Seattle, helping small businesses with their logos, Yellow Page ads, brochures, and other print and advertising materials. In the late 1990s, her clients started asking for websites, and she recruited me to learn FrontPage, Dreamweaver, and HTML so I could help out. I liked the work, and the extra money, and when I told my mom I wanted to work with her full-time and not go back to college, she obliged.<br><br> Over the summer of 2001, we dreamed big. Seattle's tech scene was booming in Microsoft's backyard. Startups like Amazon, Kozmo, and HomeGrocer dominated the local news. Everyone was switching from slow, dial-up modems to high-speed broadband. We thought we had an amazing opportunity to design sites for local businesses that needed a presence on the soon-to-be-ubiquitous Internet. When the dot-com crash hit, I barely noticed. Our clients still needed websites, and I didn't pay much attention to the falling prices, the late payments, or the commoditization of web design.<br><br> For the next three years, we struggled against increasing competition, pervasive doubt about the web's future, the challenges of getting our clients to pay their bills on time, and, worst of all, our own foolish beliefs about what would help our company grow. We were trying to sell our services in a crowded marketplace without a competitive differentiator. We wasted money on advertising that didn't bring in business. We leased high-priced office space, convinced that an impressive building would help us close deals. We hired contractors and employees who didn't work out. We rented booth space at events that didn't even pay for themselves. And, worst of all, we went into debt to do it.<br><br> When I started working with my mom, she had a small amount of debt on the business-less than $20,000 in total. But three years later, we'd amassed an additional $100,000 of debt, much of it from the aforementioned missteps. The great thing about a consulting business is supposed to be the low-capital requirements-smart operators often make their consultancies profitable from day one. We went the other direction, and in 2004, after we'd failed to secure yet another client project we thought could put us on the path to success, we defaulted.<br><br> It's hard today to imagine the pre-2008-financial-crisis world of personal debt, where banks would extend loans of $50-$100,000 to a college dropout with a tiny salary. At the time, credit card offers arrived almost weekly, promising $10,000 limits that would quickly rise to $15,000 or $20,000. Lending institutions were happy to offer us lines of credit and equipment loans despite our meager track record and nonexistent collateral. Promotional interest rates in the &lt; 2 percent range were available for the first two to three years of an account. Seduced by these offers and in desperate need of cash just to make payroll and rent for three people, we went whole hog, racking up a balance that eventually came back to bite us.<br><br> We took out loans and put them in my name because I had, at the time, nothing to lose. My mom had her and my dad's assets on the line. They owned not only their home in Seattle's suburbs but my grandmother's house in Connecticut as well, which could have also been on the chopping block as collateral. So it was my social security number and my signature on the loans-something that, at the time, didn't really scare me. Defaulting on these loans never really crossed my mind.<br><br> Two of the most memorable days in my early career came that fall, of 2004.<br><br> The first was on a Sunday. Gillian had told me and Matt, my friend and our programmer, that we'd no longer be able to afford the rent at our pricey high-rise office tower. Moving out was our only option. We found a tiny shared office space in a run-down part of Seattle above an old movie theater for only a few hundred dollars a month (versus the $2,000-plus we had been paying), but we'd need to break our lease. That meant the landlord could potentially hold our equipment-including our computers, desks, chairs, and furniture-as collateral. We had to get it out of the tower and over to the new space fast, without anyone from the building noticing. This part's straight out of a movie.<br><br> Matt and I recruited a pair of friends-Marshall and Todd, a couple with two sets of big arms, strong backs, and a spacious truck to whom we promised dinner-and quietly entered the building via the loading garage.<br><br> We were halfway through loading up when the tower's security guard arrived. Cue heart falling into stomach.<br><br> After a brief, tense discussion on either side of our locked office door, we had the guard make a phone call to Gillian. Somehow, she convinced him to let us finish moving some of the items, but we had to leave a good deal behind to make it seem that we weren't actually "moving out" but rather "moving some things around." With our pulses racing, we took Todd's half-full truck out of the loading dock and across Lake Washington to our new, tiny, bare-bones but safe-from-seizure office. We'd sacrificed a good dozen pieces of unwieldy office furniture and some cheap supplies but felt lucky just to make it out with our computers and essentials. The next week, the company my mom had run for twenty-three years officially closed, and we started a new business under a new name.<br><br> But though we'd moved and changed our name, we were far from starting fresh. A couple of months later, that gold-chained debt collector showed up, and I called my mom in a panic.<br><br> Even though the debt was being used for business purposes, the creditors would be coming after me personally because it was my signature and my social security number on the applications. Gillian told me she'd try to take care of it. That was the first day I truly understood that most of the money our company owed was actually money I owed personally.<br><br> It made sense. If Gillian had used her name and her credit to take out even more of those equipment loans and low-interest credit cards, she and my dad could be held liable for repayment, and she already had some debt of her own. They could lose their assets and be forced into bankruptcy. My grandmother could lose her house.<br><br> That evening, walking home from work, I started processing our nerve-racking situation and my role in creating it. I'd willfully chosen to ignore and not ask questions about the financial problems we were in, ostensibly so I could concentrate on my part of the work but, in honesty, because I didn't want to deal with it. My mom could handle it. That was her job, right? I was just the web design guy. . . . That's what I'd told myself. But slowly I came around to the idea that sticking my head in the sand about our debt in the hopes it would go away was an untenable path.<br><br> When You're in Debt to the Truth, the Interest Rate Sucks<br><br> Considering the onslaught of "final notice" letters, threatening phone calls, and the visit from gold-chains-and-chest-hair guy (let's go with "Rocco," as he already fit every other debt-collector stereotype), the logical move would have been to declare bankruptcy. Most of the debt was in my name, a little was in Gillian's, and, because we had defaulted on the bigger chunks in my name, the black marks I was racking up on my credit report were having a similar effect to a bankruptcy (as of this writing, my creditworthiness is still in the toilet). But we had another impediment.<br><br> During the four years we built up debt, we'd been lying.<br><br> We'd never told my dad, Scott (to whom my mom was, and remains, married), that we had any financial problems, any outstanding loans, or any debt collectors breathing down our necks. We both feared, rightly or wrongly, that if he found out, he'd divorce my mom and break up our family.<br><br> It sounds too dysfunctional to be real, but this lie of omission wasn't without precedent. Growing up, my parents lied to each other all the time-mostly about little stuff (or, at least, those are the only things I knew about). Dad would say, "Don't tell your mom we did this" or, "If anyone asks, tell them you are only seven years old/were promised a discount/were told by the staff it was okay." Mom would say, "If your father asks, tell him we used a coupon/had to because of your school/went here on behalf of a client."<br><br> These were mostly innocent lies, crafted in order to prevent an altercation and keep relationships smooth. As an adult, reflecting on these memories makes me realize how profoundly unhealthy the dynamic between my parents was, but as a child and teenager, it made reasonable sense. The goal was to limit anyone getting angry or feeling hurt or left out or ignored. We were lying to keep the peace and maintain the veneer of a happy family unit.<br><br> That debt, however, was a much bigger lie than anything I'd ever been part of. I remember Geraldine and I talking about it at the time and for years after. We wondered how my mom could stand to be around my dad, day after day, holding in this giant secret, rushing to get home before him so she could shred any potentially incriminating mail, pretending that the debt-collection calls were wrong numbers, keeping up the appearance that things were fine at work-even bringing home an occasional paycheck to make him think things were okay when we probably should have used that money to stave off the next bank that might sell our debt to collections.<br><br> Gillian, ostensibly to keep us from worrying and to help us focus on our tasks, kept some of the details and progress of our struggle against debt hidden from me at the time. It wasn't until years later that I learned how she managed to dodge some of the worst debt collectors by proactively calling the issuers of the debt (Washington Mutual, Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo), sharing the details of our situation, and offering a smaller sum than what was owed in exchange for the creditor writing off the debt rather than selling to collections. Because a collections agency would typically pay the debt holder 5-10 percent of the actual amount owed, then try to collect the full amount and profit from the delta, my mom's tactic was often successful.</p><h2>Wild Cat (A Leopard Novel)</h2><p><b>In this Leopard novel by the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Christine Feehan<i>,</i>&nbsp;passions explode like wildfire when a young woman&#x2019;s feral instincts are ignited by a man who&#x2019;s too dangerous not to desire...<br><br></b>A simple request for Siena Arnotto: deliver a gift to her grandfather&#x2019;s friend. One look at Elijah Lospostos, hard-bodied and stripped to the waist, and Siena succumbs to a feline stirring she never felt before, and to Elijah&#x2019;s reckless and pleasurable demands. But when that pulse-throbbing moment ends in the murder of an unexpected intruder, Elijah accuses the shaken and confused Siena of setting him up.<br><br>Then Siena discovers the truth of her Leopard heritage, of the secrets in her grandfather&#x2019;s inner circle, and the sinister plot of revenge that has put her in jeopardy. When Siena&#x2019;s grandfather is assassinated, she realizes the only man she can trust is Elijah. Now as her Leopard rises from within, Siena and Elijah share not only an animal instinct for survival&#x2014;but a desire so raw and wild it may be the only thing that can save them.</p><p><b>Christine Feehan</b> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Carpathian series, the GhostWalker series, the Leopard series, the Shadow Riders series, and the Sea Haven novels, including the Drake Sisters series and the Sisters of the Heart series.<b><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><br></b><p>&#x201c;Siena,&nbsp;<i>bella</i>, come see your old <i>nonno</i> for a minute.&#x201d;</p><p>Siena obediently dropped her car keys on the table and hurried into the sitting room her grandfather preferred. The room was cozy and always just a little too warm. As a rule that didn&#x2019;t bother her, but for some reason lately, her body seemed overheated. She was restless and edgy and <i>hot</i>. Very hot. Her skin ached, felt too tight, stretched over her frame. Even her jaw hurt. Her breasts felt swollen and achy, and for the first time in her life, she burned between her legs. Like crazy. It was awful.</p><p>The condition seemed to come and go at will for no apparent reason. It had started a couple of weeks earlier and was getting significantly worse. She was grateful she had just earned her masters of science in oenology and had come home, although being in the same room with her beloved grandfather when her body was on fire was decidedly uncomfortable.</p><p>She needed to get out of the house&#x2014;immediately. Lately, the condition had gotten so bad she was seriously thinking about visiting an adult store and getting herself a toy. A really good one. Sheesh. She&#x2019;d never looked at a man like that. Well, that wasn&#x2019;t strictly the truth. She&#x2019;d once seen Elijah Lospostos when she was fifteen. They sat across from each other at a dinner when she&#x2019;d been home from boarding school. He was at least eight years older than her. Maybe ten. It hadn&#x2019;t mattered. The moment she&#x2019;d laid eyes on him, something wild unfurled deep inside of her. She&#x2019;d barely been able to keep her eyes off of him. He was the most gorgeous man she&#x2019;d ever seen. <i>Ever.</i> And her grandfather employed a lot of men.</p><p>She tried as hard as she could not to stare at him, but sometimes she&#x2019;d felt his gaze on her, and every time she&#x2019;d looked up, his eyes were looking at her. There was no mistake. He smiled. She didn&#x2019;t. She blushed. A horrible reaction. He&#x2019;d tried to engage her in conversation and she&#x2019;d stammered. Blushed more. It had been horrible. She was smart. Brilliant. She was already doing college courses. And she couldn&#x2019;t say a single intelligent word to him. Even the memory embarrassed her.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it, Nonno?&#x201d; she asked, bending to brush a kiss along his jaw. She ruffled his hair. He still had a wild mane of hair. All silver, but thick as a cat&#x2019;s pelt. His eyes, a dark chocolate, were faded, but still sharp. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m off to the gym.&#x201d; Because she really, really needed to work out hard. Tire herself to the point of exhaustion so she could actually get some sleep. She was desperate for sleep.</p><p>&#x201c;I need a favor, <i>bella</i>, a small one for an old man, eh?&#x201d; he coaxed.</p><p>As if she had ever in her life turned him down when he asked her for something. She was rarely at the house. She had been in boarding school most of her life and then college, but she treasured her times at home with him. He was her only living relative. It was just Antonio Arnotto and his granddaughter. The two of them.</p><p>&#x201c;What would that be, Nonno?&#x201d; she asked, trying to sound stern. She knew she failed when the laugh lines around his eyes crinkled. She sank down onto the arm of his chair and ruffled all that silver hair again.</p><p>&#x201c;I want you to take a case of my best reserve to a friend. His birthday was last week and I forgot to send a gift around. My beautiful granddaughter delivering it personally will make up for this mistake, no?&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed. &#x201c;It seems you have a lot of friends with birthdays and anniversaries you forget until your granddaughter comes home.&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not getting any younger, Siena, and you might start thinking about marriage and babies. Come to think of it, Elijah isn&#x2019;t married, and <i>he&#x2019;s</i> not getting any younger. He&#x2019;s quite good-looking.&#x201d; He winked at her.</p><p>She bit down on her lower lip to try to keep from blushing. Just the mere mention of Elijah&#x2019;s name set her heart pounding and her stomach whooshing a slow somersault. He <i>was</i> good-looking. Hot. Gorgeous. And way out of her league. She wasn&#x2019;t going to tell her grandfather that.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop being a matchmaker. You&#x2019;ll get your babies in due time, I promise.&#x201d; Maybe sooner than he wanted if her body didn&#x2019;t stop with the meltdown-frantic-for-sex-<i>now</i> routine.</p><p>She&#x2019;d taken to looking at her grandfather&#x2019;s bodyguards. And his number one man, Paolo, the man her grandfather dreamed of having her marry. Paolo watched her all the time. He always had. His gaze burned through her. He was good-looking and always very polite to her, but she knew he was a hound dog. He went through women, and word was, he wasn&#x2019;t very nice about it. She&#x2019;d heard rumors from some of the maids and the cook that he ruled his women with an iron fist. She wasn&#x2019;t hooking up with him, even though she knew he was more than willing.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not getting any younger,&#x201d; he repeated, patting her hand. &#x201c;Be a good girl and deliver the wine for me. Give Elijah my best. Tell him not to be such a stranger and to drop by once in a while to see an old man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will, Nonnino,&#x201d; she murmured and kissed the top of his head.</p><p>The hair on the back of her neck stood up and her stomach tightened. She knew without turning her head that Paolo Riso had stepped into the room. He was all roped muscle and fluid grace, and for such a big man he moved in complete silence. She knew he was very intelligent, and her grandfather relied heavily on him. She had always gotten along with him, even liked him when she was younger, but the last few years she&#x2019;d visited home, he made her very uncomfortable.</p><p>She turned her head and forced a smile. His eyes were on her. Gleaming. Watching. Hooded. Holding secrets. Secrets she was certain involved her&#x2014;none of them good. He was very close to her grandfather, and her grandfather treated him as he might a son. She wanted to love him for that alone, but instead, each time she came back home, she found herself becoming more and more uneasy around him.</p><p>Not like her grandfather&#x2019;s second-in-command. Alonzo Massi made her entire body tense, shiver even, with revulsion. The man&#x2019;s body was massive with ropes of muscle, and he was just plain scary. His eyes were always following her around, and he appeared as cold as a snake. She wasn&#x2019;t certain what kind of job he actually did for her grandfather, but she was fairly certain it had nothing to do with the winery.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Paolo.&#x201d; She gave him a smile. She was very good at smiling and making it seem genuine. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good, <i>bella</i>.&#x201d; Paolo moved right to her.</p><p>She forced air through her lungs, knowing what was coming. He was getting bolder and bolder, and always in front of her beaming grandfather, who clearly approved. He took both hands and pulled her to her feet. Pulled her into him. He leaned down, and she turned her face slightly so his lips brushed her cheek rather than her lips.</p><p>Deep inside something that was out of control and wild leapt toward the surface. She was shocked and pulled back, although Paolo didn&#x2019;t release her hands. He stared down at her face and there was speculation there. His eyes changed color, yellow flecks spreading through the dark brown until they almost looked like a cat&#x2019;s. Wholly focused on her. Unblinking.</p><p>Heat moved through her body. This wasn&#x2019;t good. She tugged on her hands to get him to release her.</p><p>&#x201c;I have to go. Nonno asked me to run an errand for him, and I want to get to the gym tonight as well.&#x201d;</p><p>Paolo frowned. He didn&#x2019;t release her hands, but looked over his shoulder at her grandfather. &#x201c;Perhaps someone else should run the errand, Antonio.&#x201d;</p><p>There was something very subtle in his voice. A warning. An order? Whatever it was, she didn&#x2019;t like it. Siena very firmly pulled her hands away, not bothering with being polite. She always thought the infamous Arnotto temper had skipped her, but right then she knew it hadn&#x2019;t. Edgy and restless turned to fierce and formidable. She drew herself up&#x2014;and wished she was wearing her heels&#x2014;but she could look haughty without them and she gave Paolo her best princess to peasant look.</p><p>&#x201c;I told Nonno I would take the gift to Signor Lospostos and I will.&#x201d; She tossed her head, the long mane of very thick hair flying around her face and down to her waist. Bending down, she skimmed another kiss on her grandfather&#x2019;s head and then left the room with a small wave. &#x201c;<i>Addio</i> Nonnino. <i>Addio</i>, Paolo, please take care of Nonno for me.&#x201d;</p><p>She ran back upstairs to her room without a backward glance. If she was delivering wine to Elijah Lospostos, arguably the hottest man in the universe, then she was going to take a little care with her appearance. She quickly stuffed her gym clothes in a bag and changed. She didn&#x2019;t want to look like she went all out. He probably wouldn&#x2019;t even notice her, but still, she was going to look good.</p><p>Siena knew she was pretty. She looked in the mirror, and she knew. She had great skin. Perfect skin. Italian skin. Her eyes were unusual. Very large, shaped like a cat&#x2019;s, so she looked exotic to people. They were green. Not just any green; a deep, pure brilliant green, and she had lush, thick, very black eyelashes. She was blessed with those eyes.</p><p>She had the most annoying hair in the world, although even she had to admit it was beautiful. There just was too much of it. It grew and grew and never seemed to stop. She&#x2019;d tried cutting it, but that seemed to make it grow faster and even thicker than ever, so she gave up and just went with the old-fashioned look. Thick, rich, luxurious, her hair fell well past her waist in waves. It was impossible to tame, so she mostly wore it up when she was home, pulled back in a ponytail or braid. At school, of course, she had to appear a little more sophisticated so she used updos of intricate braids spun in all kinds of lovely knots.</p><p>Her nose was straight, her cheekbones high and her mouth a little too generous, but she did have straight teeth without having to go to the orthodontist. She was short. There was no getting around that. She had tried to gain a few inches by hanging upside down on the bars when she was a child, but that hadn&#x2019;t helped at all. She had a small waist and a narrow rib cage, but along with that generous mouth, her hips and breasts were a little bit on the generous side too. No matter how much she worked out or watched what she ate, she had curves. Lush curves.</p><p>She sighed. She&#x2019;d seen Elijah with a tall, thin model once, coming out of a coffee shop. The woman had blond hair and blue eyes. His arm was around her and they were laughing together. She saw him in the distance at another party her grandfather had thrown when she was sixteen, and another one at nineteen, and he&#x2019;d had a different model on his arm. Tall. Thin. Beautiful. Blond. And yet again, a few years later in a magazine. Tall. Thin. Beautiful. Blond. <i>Again</i>. He had a type and that type was <i>so</i> not her. She was short and dark and totally curvy. She looked even younger than she was, not at all sophisticated. She knew when she delivered the wine, Elijah would look at her like she was a little kid, like he always did. Antonio Arnotto&#x2019;s little granddaughter. Still, she was determined to go looking her best.</p><p>She chose soft, vintage faded jeans and a camisole that was pale green with satiny straps. The camisole emphasized her small rib cage and tucked-in waist. The color was great against her skin and really brought out her eyes. The only real problem was shoes. She wore heels all the time. She hesitated, looking at a pair of strappy green designer heels, her favorite paired with the camisole. She didn&#x2019;t want to look as if she were trying to be his type. Still, she needed confidence and heels gave her that. She shrugged and strapped them on.</p><p>Biting her lip, she stared at her wild hair. How in the world was she going to tame all that hair? There was nothing else for it on such short notice. She swept it all back away from her face into a long ponytail. She left all jewelry off.</p><p>Looking into the mirror she practiced. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my way to the gym and just stopped by to deliver your birthday gift from Nonno. I&#x2019;m sorry it&#x2019;s late, but my school didn&#x2019;t let out until this week and Nonno likes me to personally deliver . . .&#x201d; Siena groaned. That made her sound like a silly schoolgirl when she was twenty-four. &#x201c;Damn it,&#x201d; she whispered, and turned away from her image. She <i>looked</i> like a silly schoolgirl. She needed a lot more inches and a lot less curves to be the type Elijah Lospostos went for, so really, why was she bothering?</p><p>She caught up her gym bag and hurried down the stairs before she did something crazy like change her clothes again. She rushed back toward the sitting room her grandfather seemed to occupy more than ever these days, but stopped abruptly when she heard the whispered but furious conversation between her grandfather and his first-in-command. They kept their voices low, but lately she&#x2019;d noticed her hearing seemed to be very acute. At the same time, her vision messed up, so that she saw in weird bands of color. Whenever that happened, she felt restless. Edgy. Need burned hot and wild between her legs.</p><p>She held the back of a chair just outside the sitting room, her grip so hard her knuckles turned white. She took in long, deep breaths, trying to regain some semblance of control. Her bones ached. Her fingers curled, and she felt that strange feral entity unfolding deep inside of her. Her skin itched, a terrible wave that refused to stop, and she swore something was pressing on her from the inside out, needing to escape. She was afraid of that something. It was wanton, hungry and in terrible need.</p><p>She put her head down and breathed more, desperate for the feeling to pass. She was very happy Paolo was nowhere near, because the sound of his voice seemed to trigger a deeper reaction in her.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, Tonio, this is not a good idea. Something could go wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You worry too much, Paolo. Always you worry. She&#x2019;s young. Beautiful. His mind will be on her. Not my reserve. Not what day of the month it is. On her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why you have such an obsession with making certain you exact your revenge. You are putting not only Siena in jeopardy, but you as well. If evidence is left behind . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Marco knows what he is doing. Always you worry,&#x201d; her grandfather repeated.</p><p>&#x201c;She is close to the Han Vol Dan. I feel it. My other feels it. She&#x2019;s <i>very</i> close.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You saw evidence of this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No evidence, just a feeling. She can&#x2019;t do this, Tonio. Stop her. I&#x2019;m telling you, something could go wrong. If the timing is off, if she lingers . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a good girl. She will do as she&#x2019;s told and then go to her gym where many witnesses will see her there.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Witnesses? She is close?</i> What did that mean. <i>Evidence?</i> What were they talking about?</p><p>&#x201c;Tonio.&#x201d; Paolo bit out the name between his teeth.</p><p>&#x201c;Paolo.&#x201d; Her grandfather did the same. &#x201c;The subject is closed. Go find her. Tell her the wine is in her car and she must go now.&#x201d;</p><p>Paolo swore in Italian, but she knew he would obey. Everyone obeyed her grandfather. He&#x2019;d built an empire with his wineries and his amazing grapes. He had more money than he knew what to do with, and he&#x2019;d made good friends and many enemies along the way.</p><p>The breathin...</p></p><h2>Gotham Academy 1: Welcome to Gotham Academy</h2><p>Welcome to Gotham Academy, the most prestigious school in Gotham City.

Collects GOTHAM ACADEMY #1-6.</p><p>Becky Cloonan is an American comic book writer and artist known for her manga-influenced artwork. Her first major comics work came when she teamed with writer Brian Wood to create <i>Channel Zero: Jennie One</i>.&nbsp; However, she is best-known for her second collaboration with Wood, DEMO, a 12-issue limited series that was named "Indie of the Year" by Wizard Magazine in 2004 and nominated for two Eisner Awards including Best Limited Series. In 2009 Cloonan and Wood expanded DEMO and re-published it through DC Comics' Vertigo imprint. Cloonan's first solo graphic novel, <i>East Coast Rising Volume 1</i>, earned her a third Eisner Award nomination for Best New Series. Her other work for DC Comics includes AMERICAN VIRGIN, co-created with writer Steven T. Seagle, and NORTHLANDERS for Vertigo as well co-writing GOTHAM ACADEMY with Brenden Fletcher.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;This slick volume collects the first six issues of the DC comics set in a prestigious school in Gotham City. After a traumatic summer, Olive Silverlock struggles to get back into her school routine while showing around new student Maps Mizoguchi and trying to avoid her ex, Kyle, Maps's older brother. But with a possible ghost knocking on the walls and secret societies roaming the halls, Olive isn't coping well with the knowledge of her mother's precarious health condition, her studies, and her classmates' bullying. When the teen begins to recover strange memories about a fire and keeps running into a mysterious stranger with glowing eyes who seems to know her more than she knows him, she bands with other school misfits to uncover some of Gotham Academy's dark secrets. Filled with spunky and quirky characters and unexpected plot turns, this work adds an intriguing and fresh layer to the Batman mythos. In this tale, Bruce Wayne, the school's benefactor, is treated with disdain by Olive and the Batman signal is a daily occurence. Kerschl's campy art is by turns luminous and gloomy, enhancing Cloonan and Fletcher's energetic and sometimes contemplative text. The size and shape of the panels are used to great effect, adeptly building momentum with panache and verve. VERDICT The emphasis on friendships and high school drama mixed with action-packed sequences and an otherworldly tone makes this graphic novel perfect for not only fans of the franchise but those who enjoy boarding school fiction.&#x2014;Shelley Diaz, School Library Journal</p><h2>Every Dark Corner (The Cincinnati Series)</h2><p><b>In this nerve-shattering novel in <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Karen Rose's Cincinnati series, two FBI Special Agents are on the trail of a depraved criminal...</b><br><br>When FBI Special Agent Griffin "Decker" Davenport opens his eyes after several days in a coma, there is unfinished business still on his mind.

Kate reached out a tentative hand to nudge Dani&#x2019;s shoulder, just to be sure she wasn&#x2019;t still dreaming. The shoulder was solid and real.</p><p>Kate exhaled sharply. &#x201c;Dani,&#x201d; she said, just to hear her own voice. It was raspy, like sandpaper. Like she&#x2019;d been screaming. <i>Oh God, don&#x2019;t let me have been screaming.</i></p><p>Dr. Dani Novak spoke calmly, like one might speak to a feral animal. Or a wild-eyed woman just coming out of a nightmare. &#x201c;Yes. I&#x2019;m real. And yes, you&#x2019;re awake.&#x201d;</p><p>She was kneeling in front of Kate, holding the cord to her earbuds in one hand and her laptop in the other while Kate clutched the blanket she&#x2019;d been knitting to her chest like a shield.</p><p>&#x201c;You nearly lost your computer,&#x201d; Dani explained in that same calm voice. &#x201c;I came in as it was slipping off your lap. You were dreaming.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate let the knitting fall to her lap so that she could press her fingertips to her temples. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; was all she could muster. She hated waking up from that dream. Hated feeling fuzzy and disoriented. Hated the pounding of her pulse in her ears. Hated that the last thing she&#x2019;d seen was a man&#x2019;s head exploding. &#x201c;Wish you&#x2019;d come in a few seconds earlier,&#x201d; she muttered.</p><p>Dani made a sympathetic noise. &#x201c;Me, too. You were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. talking in your sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate&#x2019;s eyes widened, a different kind of fear giving her a hard jolt that woke her right up. &#x201c;What did I say?&#x201d; <i>Please don&#x2019;t let it have been too much.</i></p><p>Dani&#x2019;s voice dropped to a whisper. &#x201c;Just &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, Jack. So sorry.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;</p><p>A single nod set Kate&#x2019;s mind at ease, because even though she didn&#x2019;t know Dani all that well, she did know the woman didn&#x2019;t lie. Dani Novak was the sister of Kate&#x2019;s close friend and former Bureau partner, Deacon, who was as honest as any man she&#x2019;d ever met.</p><p>Deacon Novak was a rare find&#x2014;a male colleague who was simply a good friend. And that was all. There had never been a hint of anything else, not even once. The attraction hadn&#x2019;t been there for either of them, and Kate had been so very glad. She hadn&#x2019;t needed a lover then. She might never need one again. But she had desperately needed a friend, and Deacon had been one of the best.</p><p>When Deacon had transferred to Cincinnati from Baltimore, Kate had missed him&#x2014;his professional skill along with his sarcasm and blunt honesty. She&#x2019;d missed her friend. So when a position opened up in Cincinnati, she would have taken it even if it had meant a demotion. Luckily it had been a move up the ladder. She&#x2019;d told everyone that she&#x2019;d taken the job because of the promotion, but the real reason she&#x2019;d chosen Cincinnati out of all the possible transfers was because of Deacon Novak.</p><p>They&#x2019;d no longer work side by side&#x2014;Deacon had been assigned to a joint task force with Cincinnati PD, while Kate was squarely owned by the FBI&#x2019;s field office&#x2014;but just knowing he was close by, that she had a friend watching her back again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that was enough.</p><p>The news that Deacon had found love here in Cincinnati soon after he&#x2019;d arrived had made Kate incredibly happy. She&#x2019;d found her soulmate once upon a time, long before she&#x2019;d ever met Deacon Novak. Deacon deserved his turn now, and Kate heartily wished him and his fianc&#x41e;e, Faith, the happiness she&#x2019;d once known.</p><p>But she hoped Deacon and Faith would know their happiness for a whole lot longer than Kate had known hers, because the few years she&#x2019;d actually been happy wasn&#x2019;t much in the grand scheme of a life. Heartbroken and lost when she&#x2019;d moved to Baltimore three years ago, she hadn&#x2019;t realized how much she&#x2019;d needed a friend until she&#x2019;d met Deacon. Now&#x2014;</p><p><i>Mocking smile, barrel in his mouth, gunshot&#x2014;</i></p><p><i>Stop it.</i> Viciously she shoved the image away. But it would be back. It never went far, a nearly constant taunt. But also a constant reminder of exactly how much she needed friends. And pathetically needy as it was, Kate hoped that Deacon&#x2019;s sister might become one, too.</p><p>The Novak siblings had always seemed carved from the same rock, so Kate believed Dani when she murmured, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think anyone else heard what you said. You were more mumbling than speaking. Are you okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Kate nodded, still shaken from the dream. From the knowledge that she&#x2019;d spoken in her sleep, when she couldn&#x2019;t control her words. At least &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Jack&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t so bad. It could have been much worse. <i>At least I didn&#x2019;t scream.</i></p><p>But was she okay? <i>Hell, no.</i> She might never be okay again.</p><p>&#x201c;I will be,&#x201d; she lied. Pasting a smile on her face and willing her hands not to tremble, she relieved Dani of the computer and earbuds. &#x201c;Thanks for saving my piece-of-shit laptop.&#x201d; She put it on the floor under her chair. &#x201c;As much as I want a new one, this one can&#x2019;t break until I&#x2019;ve at least backed up my notes on the audio files I&#x2019;ve been transcribing all afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>Dani shrugged. &#x201c;The audio file was either finished or it was just a lot of dead air.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate stared at her. &#x201c;You <i>listened</i>? It was private.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not intentionally.&#x201d; Remaining calm, Dani grabbed the earbuds&#x2019; cord and held up the tail end. &#x201c;It came unplugged when I grabbed your piece-of-shit computer.&#x201d;</p><p>Now Kate felt bad. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Thank you again,&#x201d; she said humbly. &#x201c;I was being surly. I don&#x2019;t wake up very nice.&#x201d;</p><p>Dani waved the apology away. &#x201c;Neither do I. Anyway, all I could hear was static.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because the speaker&#x2019;s a piece of shit, too,&#x201d; Kate grumbled, grateful nonetheless that she hadn&#x2019;t inadvertently shared the contents of an ongoing investigation with every nurse, patient, and family member in the ICU.</p><p>&#x201c;What were you listening to?&#x201d; Dani asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201c;Recordings he made while he was undercover.&#x201d; With a quirk of her head, Kate indicated the man in the hospital bed.</p><p>Special Agent Griffin Davenport had been placed in an induced coma the week before so that he could heal after a bullet had bruised his lung, cracked a rib, and filled his chest cavity with blood. He&#x2019;d been in intensive care all that time, a ventilator breathing for him, the steady rise and fall of the man&#x2019;s massive chest evidence that the machine was doing its job.</p><p>Telling Dani that Davenport had made the recordings wasn&#x2019;t an issue. The man&#x2019;s cover had been blown sky-high while rounding up a group of human traffickers who&#x2019;d retaliated by putting him here in ICU. It had been an ER nurse who&#x2019;d found the envelope full of CDs in a pocket sewn onto the inside of his pants and turned them over to the police.</p><p>And truthfully? The contents of the CDs themselves hadn&#x2019;t been terribly damning so far, and Kate had been listening to them for days.</p><p><i>Only days? Feels like weeks.</i> There had been a lot of thug chatter, but most of it wasn&#x2019;t anything new. Nothing to warrant Davenport getting shot over, certainly.</p><p>&#x201c;Why you?&#x201d; Dani asked.</p><p>Kate jerked her gaze away from Davenport down to Dani, who was still watching her carefully from her kneeling position. &#x201c;What do you mean, why me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you listening to his recordings?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because there&#x2019;s something important on one those CDs.&#x201d; Of that she was certain. &#x201c;Davenport took a huge risk trying to get them out.&#x201d;</p><p>The envelope containing the CDs had been addressed to his handler in the event that he was unable to deliver them personally, which, in the end, was exactly what had happened. Except they hadn&#x2019;t gone to Davenport&#x2019;s handler, because he was dead, shot by members of the same ring. So Kate had listened while Davenport healed.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I mean why are <i>you</i> listening? There are a lot of agents in that office and Deacon said that you&#x2019;re one of the bigger fish in the pond now. Why not have a smaller fish do the listening?&#x201d;</p><p>Kate shrugged uncomfortably. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the new kid on the block. A week in the job and I don&#x2019;t have a caseload yet. Besides, I do have a few of the smaller fish listening, too.&#x201d;</p><p>Dani tilted her head thoughtfully, just like Kate had seen her brother do a thousand times. &#x201c;Why do you visit every day?&#x201d; She chuckled at Kate&#x2019;s look of consternation. &#x201c;You think the ICU nurses haven&#x2019;t noticed? You think they didn&#x2019;t just try to pump me for information the moment I walked in the door?&#x201d;</p><p>That the nurses would ask Dani questions wasn&#x2019;t a surprise. The woman was an ER doctor in this very hospital, although currently on a leave of absence. That they&#x2019;d ask about Kate was the mystery. &#x201c;Pump you for information about what?&#x201d;</p><p>Dani rolled her eyes. &#x201c;They all but have you two as star-crossed lovers, tragically separated but reunited when he got shot and you raced to his aid.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;You are kidding me, right? Me and Davenport?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You <i>do</i> visit every day, Kate.&#x201d;</p><p>That was true. Some of the time she&#x2019;d listened to the recordings from the privacy of her desk at the Cincinnati Field Office, but she had made a point of visiting him every day. She thought she was the only one who did, and that bothered her. She hated the thought of him being so alone after being deeply undercover. The life of an operative tended to be very lonely.</p><p>So sometimes she talked to him about trivial things&#x2014;the unrelenting heat and humidity, her search for an apartment. A few times she&#x2019;d shared her frustration at not hearing anything of value on the damn CDs. She&#x2019;d played him tunes from her iPod and read to him from the book she&#x2019;d thrown in her carry-on when she&#x2019;d left for Cincinnati last week. But mostly she simply sat with him and caught up with her knitting while she listened to the recordings he&#x2019;d risked his life to share.</p><p>&#x201c;I met him for the first time less than an hour before he got shot, and that&#x2019;s the truth.&#x201d; She sighed when Dani just waited for more, saying nothing. &#x201c;Deacon was on the team who breached the traffickers&#x2019; compound and he brought me in as one of their snipers.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d been in town all of two days, but had jumped at the chance. She didn&#x2019;t get to use her sharpshooting skills as often as she would have liked, and Deacon&#x2019;s case had been right up her alley. &#x201c;I was doing recon and saw Davenport attempting to slip away. He was trying to get the CDs out, but I didn&#x2019;t know that then. I dropped down on him from a tree.&#x201d;</p><p>Dani moved to sit in the chair beside her, her delighted grin surprising Kate more than the nurses&#x2019; gossip. &#x201c;You <i>dropped</i> him? Took him down? Goddamn, girl. You really are a super-chick. I thought Deacon was exaggerating.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate&#x2019;s cheeks heated at the praise. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t actually drop <i>on</i> him. I don&#x2019;t think I could have taken him down, even from a tree.&#x201d; Because Griffin Davenport was built like a freaking tank.</p><p>&#x201c;Hell, maybe not even from a helicopter,&#x201d; Dani murmured. &#x201c;So what did you do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I landed behind him, stuck my rifle in his back, and took him by surprise. But he wanted to be found, so he cooperated, which was a good thing. I would have hated to have to shoot him. Unfortunately the traffickers didn&#x2019;t have that concern.&#x201d;</p><p>Dani nodded soberly. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had a chance to thank you yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate frowned. &#x201c;For what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For saving Deacon&#x2019;s life. He was standing next to Davenport when the bullets started flying. If you hadn&#x2019;t stopped the shooter the way you did, there might be more patients filling these ICU beds. Or bodies in the morgue. So thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate fidgeted. &#x201c;I was just doing my job. Any of the other agents there would have done it.&#x201d;</p><p>Dani lifted one dark brow. &#x201c;The way I heard it, none of the other agents there had the skill with a rifle to stop a speeding car half a mile away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Deacon exaggerates,&#x201d; Kate mumbled, now very uncomfortable even though it was true. She was a skilled shot, but she wasn&#x2019;t a fathead. &#x201c;Besides, they were already fleeing the scene by then. I didn&#x2019;t mean to kill them. I wanted them alive for questioning.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d stopped them, but she&#x2019;d also taken out the shooter and one of his trafficking partners. The only passenger who&#x2019;d survived knew so little about the trafficking business itself that he was all but �useless.</p><p>Dani shook her head. &#x201c;You may have wanted them alive for questioning, but I&#x2019;m glad my brother is alive <i>period</i>. I owe you one, Kate. Seriously.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate started to laugh it off, but then she realized that Dani Novak really was very serious. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s my friend,&#x201d; she said simply. &#x201c;I would have done the same for any other agent, but the fact that it was Deacon made it easier to sleep that night.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Good Girl&#39;s Guide to Getting Lost: A Memoir of Three Continents, Two Friends, and One Unexpected Adventure</h2><p>Rachel Friedman has always been the consummate good girl who does well in school and plays it safe, so the college grad surprises no one more than herself when, on a whim (and in an effort to escape impending life decisions), she buys a ticket to Ireland, a place she has never visited. There she forms an unlikely bond with a free-spirited Australian girl, a born adventurer who spurs Rachel on to a yearlong odyssey that takes her to three continents, fills her life with newfound friends, and gives birth to a previously unrealized passion for adventure.&nbsp; <br><br>As her journey takes her to Australia and South America, Rachel discovers and embraces her love of travel and unlocks more truths about herself than she ever realized she was seeking. Along the way, the erstwhile good girl finally learns to do something she&#x2019;s never done before: simply live for the moment.</p><p>[1]<br><br>Our heroine, verily drowning in self-pity at the tender age of twenty, embarks on a grand adventure that is not yet either grand or an adventure but, rather, a hastily concocted plan to escape the confines of her current existence and the quotidian yet oppressive pressures contained therein.<br><br>The plane descends through a thick belt of clouds into blinding light. I haven&#x2019;t fully registered the transition from night to day until sun pours through the oblong windows, jarring me out of semi-consciousness. For the past eight hours, ever since I waved goodbye to my father at the airport and marched myself onto a plane bound for Dublin, I&#x2019;ve been wondering if I was in some altered state when I planned this trip, because the reality of it feels distinctly like a bad hangover. Being bathed in golden light only adds to my surreal arrival. Isn&#x2019;t it supposed to be raining in Ireland?<br><br>We thud against the tarmac, and my fellow passengers shuffle to life, folding in half to gather their belongings from beneath the seats. Eager to depart, the frizzy-haired girl in the row ahead of me springs up like a jack-in-the-box as soon as the seat-belt light clicks off for the last time. I remain belted in, doing my best deer-in-headlights impression. I might just stay on this plane all day, ride it round-trip like I did once when I was little and too frightened to get off the revolving ski lift at the top of the mountain. The elderly woman sitting next to me, a tiny person with papery hands and merlot-stained lips, leans over and taps the book sitting in my lap: Angela&#x2019;s Ashes.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, that poor Angela,&#x201d; she sighs in one of those lilting Irish accents that make a grocery list sound like a Yeats poem. &#x201c;Heaven knows she did the best for those boys, then Frank comes along and airs their business to the whole bloody world.&#x201d; Her tone is heavy with disdain, as if the author sold naked photos of his mother to the tabloids, not penned a Pulitzer Prize winner about his Irish childhood. Coming from the land of &#x201c;all publicity is good publicity,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d just assumed McCourt&#x2019;s native country embraced his memoir, proudly adding him to their long list (suspiciously long, really, considering Ireland&#x2019;s size) of distinguished writers. But like I was wrong about the weather, it seems I am mistaken about this, too.<br><br>Here are the facts of the present moment. It&#x2019;s 2002. I&#x2019;m twenty years old. I&#x2019;ve just embarked on four months in a foreign country alone. I&#x2019;m carrying six hundred dollars in traveler&#x2019;s checks, money saved up from waitressing last semester. I booked two nights in a Dublin hostel before I left. Other than that, I&#x2019;ve got no plan. And this greatly confounds me because I always have a plan. At least I used to be the kind of girl who always has a plan.<br><br>In a few months, I&#x2019;ll be a college senior. School has been the organizing principle of my existence for as long as I can remember, and I have no idea what comes after that. My academic parents raised me to be ambitious and goal-oriented. In particular, my father, a film professor, molded me into a second-wave feminist whose duty it was to burst forth into the world and crush the male competition. He used to routinely deconstruct the PG films we watched together to comment on the functioning of the male gaze, say, or to illustrate how gender is performative. I still remember his lecture on The Little Mermaid: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just not equitable. Ariel has to give up everything for this guy&#x2014;first her voice, then her home. On a very real level, Rachel, she has to give up who she is. What are we to make of this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jesus, Lester,&#x201d; my mother would sigh.<br><br>I was eight.<br><br>But I listened. I always listened.<br><br>I was a scholarship kid at a small, eccentric college-preparatory high school, the kind of place where you juggled two dozen AP classes at once. Much of my teenage world revolved around studying, carefully calibrated extracurricular activities, and endless rounds of practice SATs.<br><br>There was never a question of whether I would attend college&#x2014;only where. And I was desperate to go, both because my parents&#x2019; divorce when I was fifteen had left me without a place I truly identified as &#x201c;home&#x201d; and because I genuinely loved school, where the formula for success was straightforward. Study and you get good grades. Simple, safe. But no class has prepared me for the post-student leap I am facing now, and being an eternal overachiever who bases her self-worth on her GPA, I am woefully ill-equipped to take on the unpredictable, unscheduled life awaiting me after college graduation. I am terrified of this unknown.<br>In the Dublin airport, confident, purposeful travelers swirl around me, off to meetings and reunions and homes. All of them seem to know exactly where they are headed&#x2014;except me. For a few moments, I am frozen and directionless, lost amid the drifting crowds. My brain works in slow motion, registering my tasks: pick up suitcase, exchange money, find hostel.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve never been to a foreign country alone, though I&#x2019;ve been abroad a few times, starting with Germany when I was ten. My brother Dan was stationed there, and I flew over with my parents to visit him. We rented a car and dashed all over Europe. Ten days in at least as many cities, pausing just long enough to snap photos. It was exhausting, and I&#x2019;m told I didn&#x2019;t appreciate much of it. Every few years, my brother reminds me, shaking his head with renewed disgust, that I slept (slept!) through the pristine Alps.<br><br>After my sophomore year of high school, my parents discharged me to Israel with a temple youth group, even though I had recently articulated that I was &#x201c;so over Judaism.&#x201d; But it was difficult to stay pissed off for an entire summer, especially on a bus with twenty-five other teenagers and Yamud, our gigantic, hairy Israeli graduate-student guide who insisted on blasting &#x201c;We Built This City on Rock and Roll&#x201d; on his boom box every morning at six a.m. as we boarded the bus, still bleary-eyed. If you were drooping sleepily into the aisle, one of his enormous flailing wrists would smack you in the head. You might slip quietly into a window seat in the back and shut your eyes only to find his meaty fingers jabbing them open.<br><br>Each of us was assigned an identifying number and forced to shout it out (in order) at least twelve times a day, making our trip resemble one long Sesame Street episode. Peter, an unruly Canadian, insisted on substituting his name for his number. He was Rastafarian and claimed he was simply &#x201c;too burned out to remember my number, brotha.&#x201d; We found this, along with the dreadlock wig he wore over his shaved head and the fact that he smoked an invisible joint for hours at a time, across-the-board hilarious. Our Israeli guides, so unlike our regimented parents back home, just smirked and checked him off the list. They told the bus driver&#x2014;a skinny man with the same real cigarette burning out of the corner of his mouth, seemingly for days, as if fueled by miracle menorah oil&#x2014;that we were all accounted for and ready to go.<br><br>My souvenir from this first semi-independent trip to a faraway land was a small tattoo. I acquired it in a dingy corner of Jerusalem from one of those muscly guys who have inked every available nook of their flesh canvas. The tattoo is a simple quarter-sized blue flower on the lower-right side of my back: five blue petals with a hint of purple at the base, outlined in black ink. Tiny tendrils poke out like rays of sunlight. I arrived at the tattoo parlor with two quivering guy friends who insisted I go first. I smiled reassuringly up at their worried faces as the needle scratched into my bare flesh. I felt incredibly wild.<br><br>But this trip to Ireland is my first time alone in a foreign country: no family, no friends, no crazy Yamud making sure number twenty-eight is on the bus. I have only myself to rely on&#x2014;which is precisely what worries me. My friends&#x2019; and families&#x2019; collective concerns echo in my brain: Where will you live? How will you find work? Won&#x2019;t you be lonely? I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t know. All I knew was that I needed to get away. I hadn&#x2019;t actually pictured myself on the other side of that con- viction.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re so brave to go off on your own,&#x201d; my best college friend, Erica, told me a week ago, bestowing &#x201c;brave&#x201d; upon me with the distinct tone usually reserved for the word &#x201c;insane.&#x201d; Erica is interning at an art gallery in New York City this summer. It&#x2019;s the kind of thing I think I should be doing, trying out my career instead of skipping town for no discernible reason.<br><br>I can barely heave my massive red suitcase off the conveyor belt. It feels twice as heavy as when my father and I launched it into the trunk of his Hyundai before heading off to the airport. I&#x2019;m here for just over four months (an impossibly long time, now that I think about it) and have, I think, packed accordingly. Several outfits for day or night, flats for walking, sandals for warm days, sneakers for running, boots for trekking (will I be trekking anywhere? I don&#x2019;t trek back home), two pairs of pretty heels for nights out, though, of course, I don&#x2019;t know anyone in Ireland to go out with. I&#x2019;ve packed toiletries, twelve books, twenty pairs of underwear, ten pairs of socks, three sweaters, two jackets, three swimsuits, enough vitamin C to turn me into an orange, and two fluffy bath towels.<br><br>A guy with greasy blond hair and Atlantic-blue eyes hoists a backpack onto his shoulders. He snaps it around his waist. It&#x2019;s half the size of his body, and I could fit four of them inside Big Red. Surely, with such modest gear, he must be traveling only for a week or two. And he must be moving around a lot. I plan on staying right here in Dublin. My instinct, as always, is to settle down, dig my heels in, and work hard at something, even if that something is only waiting tables. But it will be waitressing in a foreign country, far away from home. The backpacker strides swiftly out the door, looking carefree and unencumbered, leaving me with the exhausting thought of maneuvering my monstrous luggage through an unfamiliar city.<br><br>Why Ireland? Well, for starters, four hundred dollars (my parents&#x2019; generous, hesitant contribution) is enough to purchase a student work visa, something available in only a handful of countries, two of them&#x2014;Australia and New Zealand&#x2014;instantly ruled out because they are too far to find cheap airfare. Also, the rainy Irish weather appeals to me. If I am going to be miserable, I want the skies to match my mood. Last fall I took a course on Joyce, and I&#x2019;ve been conjuring up long, dreary days wandering like Ulysses, rainy nights in caf�s punishing myself with Finne?gans Wake. This portrait appeals to my romanticized notion of melancholy, the kind I plan to undertake in Ireland, not at all like my current depressive state of pondering my postgraduate future, which consists of numbly attending lectures, sleeping twelve hours a day, and when I&#x2019;m feeling really ambitious, staring blankly at the wall. Most of all, I just want to be somewhere else. When it comes to Ireland, it&#x2019;s not so much a matter of Why here? as Will it be far enough?<br><br>It is not solely the post-graduation unknown that has unhinged me recently. It is also the fact that I was not expecting to be facing the abyss at all because I&#x2019;ve had a very specific plan for my life since fourth grade. Up until recently, I fully expected to transition smoothly into the &#x201c;real world,&#x201d; riding into the gloriousness of my adulthood on the coattails of my one true calling: music. Viola, to be specific, the instrument I devoted myself to since I was eight. I even spent my freshman year of college studying with the principal of the Boston Symphony. But somehow, everything fell apart that year, and I was no longer on my way toward being a professional musician."Friedman's coming-of-age memoir captures the excitement (and bewilderment) of testing out life's possibilities on the far side of the world.&nbsp; You'll laugh and empathize as you get lost with her." <br>--Rolf Potts, author of Vagabonding<br><br>"Curious, candid, energetic, and witty, Rachel Friedman is the ideal travel mate, and her sense of humor makes every page of this book a pleasure to read.

"Mantle's life story has been told many times, but it's never received as loving a treatment as this one," raves&nbsp;<i>Booklist</i> in its Starred review.<br>&nbsp;<br>Castro offers illuminating new insight into Mantle's extraordinary career, including the head-turning conclusion based on the evolution of analytics that the beloved Yankee switch-hitter may ultimately win acclaim as having fulfilled the weighty expectations once placed on him: of being greater than even Babe Ruth.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I was attracted to the double tragedy of Mickey's youth and his death hanging over him and how he loses the only person who meant anything to him&nbsp;--&nbsp;his father," writes Castro, who is also the biographer of literary giant Ernest Hemingway and who knew Mantle personally.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Mutt Mantle, the center of Mickey's universe, died tragically young in the spring of 1952, Mantle's second season as a Yankee. And, in his own way, Mickey goes mad with grief and rage. How could you not be moved by that story?<br>&nbsp;<br>"Set in the epic world of baseball in which Mantle has a grand destiny, Mickey's story&nbsp;is just an updating of one of the oldest classics in literature. Whether it's Achilles going mad with grief and rage after the death of his cousin and friend Patroclus. Or Hamlet going mad with grief and rage after the murder of his father.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Achilles used his rage to help conquer Troy, and Hamlet's rage drove him to destroy the kingdom that had been stolen from his father.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"Mantle? Though he, too, was doomed and without giving much thought to his own health, Mickey led a New York Yankees wrecking crew to championship after championship, becoming certainly the greatest switch-hitter in baseball and arguably&nbsp;--&nbsp;certainly in the minds of his legion of fans&nbsp;--&nbsp;the greatest player in the game.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Mickey's is the definitive father-son story of our time."&nbsp;mickeymantle.live<b><b> </b> </b></p><p>My late friend Carlos Fuentes, the Mexican writer and diplomat, used to say that the only way you can come to know someone is by making sure you have figuratively closed off all doors to what you have known of them in the past. This becomes almost impossible for someone like Mantle whose life transcends decades and has become a national institution, as if his image has been carved into our Olympus of pop culture.<br><br>I first met Mickey Mantle in 1970, the year after his retirement and shortly after he had returned to Dallas from a frustrating season as a coach of the New York Yankees. Mickey had lived in Dallas since the late 1950s, and only earlier that year I had joined the reporting staff of the&nbsp;<i>Dallas Times Herald</i>right out of college. One of the first things I did upon going to work at the&nbsp;<i>Times Herald&nbsp;</i>was to check the Mickey Mantle files at the newspaper's morgue. I was stunned to see the scarcity of any Mantle clips since his retirement. No lifestyle pieces, no Mick-in-retirement articles. You would have thought Mantle didn't reside in Dallas. A couple of national pieces had been written about Mickey in retirement, but nothing locally. I lobbied for an assignment to interview Mantle, which came my way because no one else was interested. Heck, my editors themselves weren't interested.<br><br>When I first contacted Mantle, I started getting a sense of why no one was writing about him. Even after I explained that his home telephone number had been in our City Desk files, Mickey seemed miffed. I remember his words as something that might have come from Yogi Berra.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Mickey said over the phone, "I only gave out that number so that I could be reached whenever someone needed to talk to me."<br><br>Mickey was close to an hour late to our lunch interview. As I write in the book, he had wanted to meet at a trendy burger shop in the Turtle Creek section of North Dallas. When he finally arrived, Mickey apologized in a matter-of-fact manner. He said, "There was a screw-up on our tee time this morning."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I was immediately blown away. Not because I was finally meeting my boyhood hero, face to face, but because as I saw him&nbsp;--slightly red-eyed, smiling crookedly, slurring some of his words -- I thought to myself, my God, it's like meeting my father. They both were heroes, and they both were drinkers. And not happy drunks either. Of course, I didn't tell Mickey he reminded me of my father. Nor did I tell my father that he reminded me of Mickey. But from experience, I had an understanding of how to deal with Mantle. An interview, a formal question and answer interview, was out of the question. Instead, over charbroiled cheeseburgers and beers, Mickey rambled in a disjointed exercise of free association for which I wasn't prepared.<br>&nbsp;<br>We talked for close to two hours that afternoon, and I remember being panic-stricken the longer we talked because I feared that I actually had little to use in a traditional story about Mickey in retirement. He would clam up when the conversation turned to things he was doing now. A bowling alley bearing Mickey's name in Dallas had closed down, and then re-opened, and Mickey was unclear as to what the status of it was. He didn't want to talk about his investments, and he was equally evasive on questions about his life with his sons. There was one comment I wrote several times in my notebook: "We're doing a lot more things together now, that's for sure."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>My time with Mickey might have ended that afternoon had we not started talking about the one thing that eventually got him to open up -- golf.In 1970, an unhappy, often drunk, faded baseball hero Mickey Mantle was adjusting poorly to his discontentment in retirement in football-crazed Texas where his bad temper and ill-manners had alienated both sportswriters&nbsp;and sports fans whose darlings in this post-Sixties disco age were the new "America's Team," the Dallas Cowboys.<br>It was against that backdrop that Mantle met a young Dallas newspaperman, Tony Castro, a recent college graduate who could play golf often and whose hard-drinking father's frequent carousing had groomed him well to dealing with profane, mean alcoholics who needed looking after as well as driving home to sleep off their drunken stupors. He even had a pretty young bride who sadly reminded Mantle of his tragic first love.<br>In this time of reckoning to his premature demise from stardom and fame, Mantle opened up to his young friend during drunken rounds on the golf, on drives along dusty Texas roads, and even on a visit to the home of a <i>Santeria</i> priestess. Castro also got to know Merlyn, whom Castro often drove to recover Mickey's El Dorado wherever he might have abandoned it.<br>Eventually Castro, who otherwise reported on civil rights and politics, wrote his best-selling classic <i>Mickey Mantle: America's Prodigal Son</i> (Brasseys, 2002), which The New York Times has called the best biography ever written about The Mick. Castro assumed Merlyn hadn't liked it. He was wrong. She had, she told him when they spoke several years later.&nbsp;<br>"Why didn't you say it," she said in her only criticism, "that Mickey was greater than Joe DiMaggio and that his accomplishments, when you consider different eras and that Mickey played his entire career on only one healthy leg, were right up there with Babe Ruth? All these new ways of looking at statistics in baseball are pointing to that. Look it up. That day is coming. And now that's on you. You have to be Mickey's voice from the grave."<br><i>Mantle: The Best There Ever Was</i> is now that book.</p><h2>Duck Decoys: Classic Carving Projects Made Easy (Fox Chapel Publishing) Carve a Traditional Mallard Drake from Start-to-Finish, including Patterns, Paint Swatches, and Expert Step-by-Step Instruction</h2><p><p> <strong>Learn to carve a traditional mallard decoy from start-to-finish!</strong> </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Step-by-step</strong> instructions to carving a mallard drake </li> <li> <strong>Carving pattern included</strong> along with paint swatches </li> <li> <strong>Hundreds of photos</strong> illustrate every step of the process </li> <li> <strong>Author Tom Matus</strong> is a world champion wildfowl carving and has won over 75 Best of Show awards for his hunting decoys nationwide </li> </ul> <p> Learn to carve a traditional mallard drake decoy from start-to-finish with the expert instruction provided in this book. </p> <p> The duck decoy has a long tradition as a classic carving project.

In issuing his argument for this society, Kropotkin critiques the various economic systems, from pure capitalism to state-run socialism to collectivism. Additionally, he provides the reader with a history of the revolution, analyzing the failures and successes of past revolutions, including the French revolutions of 1789, 1848, and 1871. Throughout, Kropotkin emphasizes humanity's ability to cooperate and advance through mutual aid and science &#x2013; abilities critical to the success of the revolution and post-revolution society. The Conquest of Bread is an important and enduring work of political theory and anarchist thought.</p><p>This Dialectics edition includes nearly 100 new historical and biographical footnotes and notes on the English translation from the original French text. Also included are nine historic lithographs, etchings, and woodblock prints depicting the periods discussed in the book. These notes and illustrations help to make The Conquest of Bread as relevant today as when it was first published.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>Peter Alexeyevitch Kropotkin (1842&#x2013;1921) was born into Russian nobility but abandoned his princely title at the age of twelve. An ardent intellectual, he read widely in politics and science. As his education progressed&#x2014;and his exposure to revolutionary writings&#x2014;he became more concerned with the plight of the peasants and workers. After graduating from an elite military school, he pursued geography, undertaking important research expeditions and becoming a member of the RussianGeographical Society.</p><p>In 1872, he traveled to Switzerland, where he briefly joined the International Working Men&#x2019;s Association. He also stayed with the Jura Federation, coming away deeply influenced by that unique association and taking up the anarchist cause.</p><p>He returned to Russia and was arrested in 1874 for belonging to a secret, revolutionary group. After two years in prison, and just before his trial, he escaped with the help of friends, fleeing to England. He lived in exile until the overthrow of the Tsar in 1917.</p><p>He settled in with the Jura Federation, where he edited the newspaper Le R�volt�. In 1881, he was expelled from Switzerland. He went to England, and then France. In France he was arrested and imprisoned at Clairvaux until an early release in 1886. Again, he returned to England, where he stayed until his final return to Russia. In England, he started the anarchist newspaper, Freedom, and restarted Le R�volt� as La R�volte. The Conquest of Bread first appeared in these papers.</p><p>In The Conquest of Bread, Kropotkin details an anarcho-communist society. The book is not only a rejection of government in all forms, but also a rejection of the wages system, including the labor-based wages system that the Collectivists espoused. Further, his lifelong passion for science is evident in the vision that he brings forth.</p><p>With the February Revolution of 1917, Kropotkin was finally able to return to Russia. He took interest in the Revolution and briefly stayed in Moscow. However, the Bolsheviks took power during the October Revolution of 1917, and Kropotkin moved to the town of Dmitrov where he did not participate in the local Soviet. He died in 1921 at the age of seventy-eight.</p><p>In an effort to bridge the gap between the original publication of The Conquest of Bread and today, Dialectics has included footnotes that give brief biographies, histories, and commentaries on the translations.</p></p><p>Peter Kropotkin (1842 &#x2013; 1921) was born a Russian prince, but abandoned his title at the age of twelve. He escaped from his first imprisonment and lived the bulk of his life in exile. Though he was a skilled geographer, he is most known for being an important theorist of anarchism and anarchist communism.</p><h2>Planet of Twilight (Star Wars)</h2><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Barbara Hambly returns to the Star Wars(r) universe to tell a breathtaking tale of a mysterious world where the battle between the New Republic and the Empire takes a shocking new twist....<br><br>Nam Chorios is a barren backwater world--once a dreaded prison colony, now home to a fanatic religious cult. It is here that Princess Leia has been taken captive by a ruthless and charismatic warlord bent on destroying the New Republic. Meanwhile, Luke lands on a mysterious planet in search of his lost love, Callista, only to discover the Force is his own worst enemy. But worst of all, as Han, Chewie, and Lando leave Coruscant on a desperate rescue mission, a strange life-form, unlike any the galaxy has ever seen, awakens...a life-form so malevolent it will destroy everything--both Empire and New Republic--on its path to domination.</p><p>Prepare yourself for a nonstop Leia-fest. The New Republic's new leader is back in bondage again, but at least this time she doesn't have Jabba the Hut slobbering all over her. Kidnapped after a clandestine mission to the former prison-planet Nam Chorios goes awry, Leia relies on her wits, her ever-developing Jedi powers (including some mean saber-swinging), and her pals to escape, survive, and resolve the conflict on the desolate planet. Han, Chewie, and Lando may get short shrift in <i>Planet of Twilight</i>, but Luke gets in some good scenes on the trail of Force-sensitive babe Callista, and the droids provide more than their share of laughs. While veteran writer Hambly doesn't subscribe to the admittedly entertaining shut-up-and-start-blasting school of <i>Star Wars</i> writing, her skilled characterizations and more literary stylings are a welcome addition to the fold. <i>--Paul Hughes</i>The <i>Star Wars</i>� saga continues in hardcover. Renat Chorios is abackwater land that serves as a sanctuary for a peaceful religious cult. Butpeace is threatened with the rise of a sinister warlord who takes Princess Leiahostage by tricking her into attending a diplomatic meeting.

Little wonder, as they were thought to be descended from the Fallen Angels and to have the power to destroy the world itself. Despite their modern image as gauzy playmates, fairies caused ordinary people to flee their homes out of fear, to revere fairy trees and paths, and to abuse or even kill infants or adults held to be fairy changelings. Such beliefs, along with some remarkably detailed sightings, lingered on in places well into the twentieth century. Often associated with witchcraft and black magic, fairies were also closely involved with reports of ghosts and poltergeists.<br><br> In literature and art, the fairies still retained this edge of danger. From the wild magic of <i>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i>, through the dark glamour of Keats, Christina Rosetti&#x2019;s improbably erotic poem &#x201c;Goblin Market,&#x201d; or the paintings inspired by opium dreams, the amoral otherness of the fairies ran side-by-side with the newly delicate or feminized creations of the Victorian world. In the past thirty years, the enduring link between fairies and nature has been robustly exploited by eco-warriors and conservationists, from Ireland to Iceland. As changeable as changelings themselves, fairies have transformed over time like no other supernatural beings. And in this book, Richard Sugg tells the story of how the fairies went from terror to Tink.</p><p><b>Richard Sugg</b> is the author of eight books, including <i>Mummies, Cannibals and Vampires</i>; <i>A Century of Ghost Stories</i>; and <i>A Singing Mouse at Buckingham Palace</i>."Engrossing." (Mary Ann Gwinn <i>Seattle Times</i>)<br><br>"Sugg&#x2019;s book is in itself a kind of bewitchment, shimmering and eloquent, written with a certain ironic awareness and in the spirit of surrender to unknowing. As he notes: 'Magic was before science and will be after it. Fairies live longer than pedagogues.'" (<i>Australian</i>)<br><br>"[Delves] at length, and with admirable knowledge and insight, into contemporary media spins on [its] respective totems. . . . Thoroughly researched and richly illustrated chronicles of the folkloric and literary pedigrees of [its] subject creatures." (Bob Duffy <i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Sugg . . . wants to disabuse you of any nonsense you may harbor about fairies being small, whimsical, and affectionate. The fact is, for much of recorded history they were regarded as dangerous and malicious. Traditional fairy belief has it that they were the original fallen angels, who accompanied the Proud Angel to a realm between Heaven, Hell, and Earth. Sugg writes well, and amusingly, about the evolution of fairies from Terror to Tinkerbell." (Sarah Murdoch <i>Toronto Star</i>)<br><br>"[A] bulging field guide to fairy lore. Taking readers on a tour of the brownies, hobs, changelings, kelpies, selkies, sea trows, and various other fairy types of the British Isles and beyond, Sugg investigates 'the great heresy of fairyland' in folklore, the arts, and historical testimony. This panoramic guide to the sights, sounds, and even smells of fairies . . . begins sensibly enough with the question of fairy geography, charting real-world locations of fairy sightings . . . The book continues with an absorbing range of reports from those claiming to have seen fairies . . . as well as the more scholarly accounts of figures such as Arthur Conan Doyle and the composer Thomas Wood." (Elizabeth Dearnley <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>"Far from the innocuous flutterings of Disney films, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries fairies were often regarded as dangerous creatures. Abduction, murder, being forced to dance to death: these were only a few of the fates they could hand out, and people lived in real fear of their otherworldly strangeness. This account of apparent 'sightings,' and what they tell us about wider society, makes for compelling reading."

In The Burden of Bad Ideas, Heather Mac Donald reports on their disastrous effects throughout our society. At a Brooklyn high school, students perfect their graffiti skills for academic credit. An Ivy League law professor urges blacks to steal from their employers. Washington bureaucrats regard theft by drug addicts as evidence of disability, thereby justifying benefits. Public health officials argue that racism and sexism cause women to get AIDS. America&#39;s premier monument to knowledge, the Smithsonian Institution, portrays science as white man&#39;s religion. Such absurdities, Ms. Mac Donald argues, grow out of a powerful set of ideas that have governed our public policy for decades, the product of university faculties and a professional elite who are convinced that America is a deeply unjust society. And while these beliefs have damaged the nation as a whole, she observes, they have hit the poor especially hard. Her reports trace the transformation of influential opinion-makers (such as the New York Times) and large philanthropic foundations from confident advocates of individual responsibility, opportunity, and learning into apologists for the welfare state. In a series of closely reported stories from the streets of New York to the seats of intellectual power, The Burden of Bad Ideas reveals an upside-down world and how it got that way.</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesHeather Mac Donald, a nonpracticing lawyer, is a John M.

Her first book, <i>The Burden of Bad Ideas</i> (also published by Ivan R. Dee), was enthusiastically praised and is now in a sixth printing. She lives and writes in New York City.</p><h2>Star Of The Sea</h2><p>In the bitter winter of 1847, from an Ireland torn by famine and injustice, the Star of the Sea sets sail for NewYork. On board are hundreds of refugees, some optimistic, many more desperate. Among them are a maid with a devastating secret, the bankrupt Lord Merridith, his wife and children, and a killer stalking the decks, hungry for the vengeance that will bring absolution. <br><br>This journey will see many lives end, others begin anew. Passionate loves are tenderly recalled, shirked responsibilities regretted too late, and profound relationships shockingly revealed. In this spellbinding tale of tragedy and mercy, love and healing, the farther the ship sails toward the Promised Land, the more her passengers seem moored to a past that will never let them go. <br><br>As urgently contemporary as it is historical, this exciting and compassionate novel builds with the pace of a thriller to a stunning conclusion. <br></p><p>Joseph O'Connor's impressive historical novel, <i>Star of the Sea</i>, examines the unsettled personal tragedies among a group of interrelated characters and their difficulties in disregarding the past. Lord Merridith and his family board the titular ship in 1847, bound for New York, leaving behind an Ireland devastated by famine and strife. The family's beautiful nanny, Mary Duane, is with them, having fled a life of poverty, prostitution, and extreme tragedy. Another passenger, American journalist Grantley Dixon, is lured to America by business and his thinly veiled affair with Lady Merridith. Mary Duane discovers that Pius Mulvey, her former fianc� and the brother of her deceased husband, is among the overcrowded group of disease-ridden steerage passengers. A renowned thief and murderer, Mulvey abandoned Duane, only to return and sabotage her life in Ireland. Despised by his countrymen, Mulvey has been ordered by a group of steerage thugs to assassinate the demonized Merridith or face his own death. <p> Conflict is inevitable, but O'Connor is more interested in the complexity of history and relationships and how each makes reinvention and resolution impossible. O'Connor presents the story as a work of journalism written by Dixon, composed in the era's tabloid style, even including passages from the captain's register and crew interviews. These devices lend the work a sense of authenticity, reinforced by the author's intimate knowledge of the period and his evocative, realistic prose: "At night one sensed the ship as absurdly out of its element, a creaking, leaking, incompetent concoction of oak and pitch and nails and faith, bobbing on a wilderness of viciously black water which could explode at the slightest provocation." O'Connor conveys a sense of immediacy and dimension in his ambitious story, providing this uncertain voyage with an ultimate sense of direction. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2003, 0-15-100908-2 <br></p><h2>Answering Atheism: How to Make the Case for God with Logic and Charity</h2><p>Today&#39;s New Atheists don&#39;t just deny God&#39;s existence (as the old atheists did) - they consider it their duty to scorn and ridicule religious belief. We don&#39;t need new answers for this aggressive modern strain of unbelief: We need a new approach. In Answering Atheism, Trent Horn responds with a fresh and useful resource for the God debate, based on reason, common sense, and more importantly, a charitable approach that respects atheists sincerity and good will making this book suitable not just for believers but for skeptics and seekers too. Meticulously researched, and street-tested in Horn s work as a pro-God apologist, it tackles all the major issues of the debate, including: -Reconciling human evil and suffering with the existence of a loving, all-powerful God -Whether the empirical sciences have eliminated the need for God or in fact point to him -How atheists usually deny moral laws (and thus a moral lawgiver) in theory but seldom in practice -History s best arguments for the existence of God and how to answer objections to them Read Answering Atheism and become thoroughly equipped to rebut atheists challenges and to share with them the good news that God is real.</p><p>Trent Horn is an apologist at Catholic Answers. Since he converted to Catholicism at the age of 17, Trent has had a passion for explaining and defending the Faith. After college, Trent traveled the country training pro-life advocates on college campuses to engage opponents in compassionate and persuasive dialogue. Trent then earned a master s degree in theology at Franciscan University of Steubenville and before joining Catholic Answers served as a respect life coordinator for the Diocese of Phoenix. A dynamic speaker and debater, Trent is also the author of Answering Atheism and Persuasive Pro-Life.Answering Atheism gets high grades on the three R's: It is readable, reasonable, and researched. Its defense of the cosmological argument has depth and detail, yet it is not so technical that you need to take a philosophy course to comprehend it. --Peter Kreeft, professor of philosophy, Boston College<br><br>I've read many works of popular apologetics; this is the best! --Stephen Bullivant, editor, The Oxford Handbook of Atheism<br><br>This compelling book deserves the widest possible audience of theists and atheists alike. Both groups will benefit by considering the serious, sophisticated, and intellectually satisfying case for the Christian world view that Trent Horn lays out in these pages. --Patrick Madrid, author of Envoy for Christ: 25 Years as a Catholic Apologist, and host of the Right Here, Right Now radio show</p><h2>Schooling by Design: Mission, Action, and Achievement</h2><p>Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe answer these and other questions in Schooling by Design: Mission, Action, and Achievement. Building on the premise of Understanding by Design, their acclaimed framework for curriculum, instruction, and assessment, the authors present a compelling argument for using the same approach to reach a grand goal: the reform of schooling as a whole.</p><p>Why, despite years of trying, have efforts to achieve lasting, effective school reform fallen short? What curricular and policy elements must be in place to move forward? How should the roles of teachers and education leaders be defined to best support the point of school? <p> Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe answer these and other questions in Schooling by Design: Mission, Action, and Achievement. Building on the premise of Understanding by Design, their acclaimed framework for curriculum, instruction, and assessment, the authors present a compelling argument for using the same approach to reach a grand goal: the reform of schooling as a whole. In their view, reform rests on six pillars:: (1) a relentless focus on the long-term mission of school: enabling learners to demonstrate understanding and mature habits of mind; (2) a curriculum and assessment framework that honors the mission and ensures that content coverage is no longer the accepted approach to instruction; (3) a set of principles of learning that support all decisions about pedagogy and planning; (4) structures, policies, job descriptions, practices, and use of resources consistent with mission and learning principles; (5) An overall strategy that includes ongoing feedback and adjustment; and (6) aA set of tactics linked to strategy, including a planning process that uses backward design to accomplish the key work of reform. </p><p> Practical, insightful and provocative, Schooling by Design elaborates on each of these elements and presents educators with both the rationale and the methodology for closing the gap between what we say we want from school and what school actually delivers--for turning vision into reality.</p>GRANT P.

She has been teaching, choreographing, and performing dance in the Seattle area since 1987, with an emphasis on teaching creative and modern dance to children. She is on the faculty of the Creative Dance Center in Seattle and has served as an Artist in Residence for the Montana Public Schools. She frequesntly presents workshops for preschool and classroom teachers on integrating dance into basic curriculum. <p>Pamela Gerke has been Director and Playwright for Kids Action Theater Play Productions in Seattle since she created it in 1988. She has written and produced over 25 children's plays, as well as being composer and music director for several other shows. Pamela understands the needs and issues of elementary education - having worked as an elementary school music and movement specialist since 1985. She currently divides her time between Kids Action Theater and choral conducting.</p>Early childhood teachers interested in exploring dance and creative movement with their students may find a use for this title and its novel approach to learning. The authors explain in a clear and succinct manner the reasons for integrating movement in the classroom and provide a solid rationale and several instructional tips for their methods. Teachers will also discover how these movement activities benefit a child's development, as the authors discuss the relationship between movement and social, emotional, physical, and mental skills. After explaining their concepts and rationale, the authors provide 10 stories containing movement exercises that demonstrate those concepts. Children and their teachers then can perform the movements together while the teachers tell the story. The stories are simple, and incorporate the movements smoothly, realistically, and in a complementary fashion. The authors suggest conducting a half-hour movement lesson as a part of the classroom's daily structure, and include a sample lesson plan. A discography and bibliography contain source information, but not enough recent sources or information on ordering and availability. While these stories and activities may not be suited for a traditional story program, public libraries could consider this as an additional resource for their early childhood collections. School libraries will want to consult with early childhood staff to determine need.?Kevin Wayne Booe, Boise (ID) Public Library<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kiki's Delivery Service Film Comic, Vol. 1 (1) (Kiki&#x2019;s Delivery Service Film Comics)</h2><p>Kiki, a young witch-in-training, has reached the age of 13.

Secrets. Adventure.</b><br><br>America is on the brink of war with England, and Fin Button is about to come undone. She's had it with the dull life of the orphanage, and she's ready to marry Peter and get away from rules, chores, and a life looked after by the ever-watchful Sister Hilde. But an unexpected friendship forms between Fin and the fiddle-playing cook, Bartimaeus, which sets her on a course for revolution. With Bart's beloved fiddle and haunting blunderbuss as her only possessions, Fin discovers her first taste of freedom as a sailor aboard the Rattlesnake. She's hiding some dark secrets, but there are bigger problems for the crew: they are on the run from the Royal Navy, and whispers of mutiny are turning the captain into a tyrant. When Fin finally returns home, will she find Peter still waiting, or will she find that she's lost everything she once held dear?</p><p>A.S. &#34;Pete&#34; Peterson is a contributing writer at The Rabbit Room (RabbitRoom.com), a community of writers and artists drawn together by a mutual desire to seek truth in storytelling. He lives in Nashville, Tennessee where he wishes he had more time to sail.I found myself stopping to reread passages because they were so beautifully written. The characters that populate the world of The Fiddler's Gun are so sharply drawn that I found myself thinking about them while I wasn't reading the book and that's one of the best compliments I can give any story. This is not a tame tale, there is violence and darkness but there's also love and hope and whispers of redemption. This is an adventure story and it's a love story. There are pockets of beautiful writing that will still your heart and characters that are impossible not to feel for. And it's also a bit of historical fiction! Truly, The Fiddler's Gun is reading at it's best. ----- Review from MyFriendAmysBlog.com<br><br>With dogged fidelity, Peterson captures the spirit, manners, and social conditions present during the American Revolutionary War. We meet colorful, credible characters who navigate the high seas of life and love, dependence and independence, war and peace, truth and consequence, and despite forays into dark places, The Fiddler's Gun is beautiful, lyrical, and redemptive. A.S. Peterson has crafted a work of compelling historical fiction which begs the question, "Can this really be a debut novel?"----- Review from The Phantom Tollbooth<br><br>Great books like The Fiddlers Gun give a lifelike voice to historic characters on whose fictional shoulders we stand. We peer into Fins story through the eve and eye of The Revolutionary War. Theres her best friend Peter LaMee, her foe Sister Hilde; humor, romance, betrayal, grand ships, swearing sailors, pirates, gallows, Red Coats, Tories, and the hunger for American independence. Though within the epic framework, Fin just craves acceptance and love, to be an orphan no longer to belong. Here we have a book that is a New York Times bestsellers equal produced in the very fashion of redemption.----- Review from Curator Magazine</p><h2>A Void (Verba Mundi)</h2><p>The year is 1968, and as France is torn apart by social and political anarchy, the noted eccentric and insomniac Anton Vowl goes missing. Ransacking his Paris flat, his best friends scour his diary for clues to his whereabouts. At first glance these pages reveal nothing but Vowl's penchant for word games, especially for "lipograms," compositions in which the use of a particular letter is suppressed. But as the friends work out Vowl's verbal puzzles, and as they investigate various leads discovered among the entries, they too disappear, one by one by one, and under the most mysterious circumstances ...<br><br>A Void is a metaphysical whodunit, a story chock-full of plots and subplots, of trails in pursuit of trails, all of which afford Perec occasion to display his virtuosity as a verbal magician, acrobat, and sad-eyed clown. It is also an outrageous verbal stunt: a 300-page novel that never once employs the letter E. Adair's translation, too, is astounding; Time called it "a daunting triumph of will pushing its way through imposing roadblocks to a magical country, an absurdist nirvana of humor, pathos, and loss."</p><p>Georges Perec (1936-82) won the Prix Renaudot in 1965 for his first novel Things: A Story of the Sixties, and went on to exercise his unrivalled mastery of language in almost every imaginable kind of writing, from the apparently trivial to the deeply personal. He composed acrostics, anagrams, autobiography, criticism, crosswords, descriptions of dreams, film scripts, heterograms, lipograms, memories, palindromes, plays, poetry, radio plays, recipes, riddles, stories short and long, travel notes, univocalics, and, of course, novels. Life: A User&#39;s Manual, which draws on many of Perec&#39;s other works, appeared in 1978 after nine years in the making and was acclaimed a masterpiece to put beside Joyce&#39;s Ulysses. It won the Prix Medicis and established Perec&#39;s international reputation.I once had the occasion to write to the translator of these books, David Bellos, and I took the opportunity to let him know that Perec is my favorite writer, and that, since a translator is to a large extent the creative force behind a translated work, he, David Bellos, is also, in a palpable way, my favorite writer. Few writers have opened up the possibilities of literary art with as much enthusiasm, mastery, and pleasure as Perec. --Martin Riker, Associate Director of the Dalkey Archive Press</p><h2>Get the Life You Want: The Secrets to Quick and Lasting Life Change with Neuro-Linguistic Programming</h2><p><b>Richard Bandler </b>is known worldwide as the cofounder of neurolinguistic programming (NLP).

Personal freedom means having the freedom to be able to control your thoughts and to manifest the kinds of feelings you want in your life.<br><br>We are often imprisoned by the chains of our thoughts and we allow ourselves to think ourselves into problems. However, since most problems are created by our imagination and are thus imaginary, all we need are imaginary solutions. So, here are some effective ways of controlling your thinking for a change.<br><br>Think of a time when you felt really good. Now, step inside that time and see through your eyes, hear through your ears, and feel the really good feeling all the way through your body. Make the images bigger, brighter, more colorful, and you'll probably find yourself feeling even better. Make the sounds louder and crisper, and if there are no sounds, add sounds. Start to intensify the good feeling.<br><br>Next, find out where in your body the feeling starts and where it goes. Discover the direction it spins inside your body, and spin it faster and faster and, again, notice your feelings intensify. There lies the control you have over your brain to create powerful feelings inside of you.<br><br>You can then attach these feelings to other thoughts. If you keep spinning this feeling inside your body and you think about your future while it's spinning, you will start to associate the feeling with your future. By doing this, you will start to feel better about your future.<br><br></p> <p><strong>How to Feel Wonderful Exercise</strong></p> <p><br>1 - Think of a time you felt wonderful.<br>2 - Close your eyes and imagine that time in vivid detail. See the image clearly, hear the sounds loudly, remember the feelings as they were then.<br>3 - Imagine yourself stepping into that experience and imagine being in that memory as if it's happening now. See what you'd see, hear what you'd hear, feel how good you'd feel. Make the colors stronger and brighter if that helps. Notice how you were breathing back then, and breathe that way now.<br>4 - Pay attention to the wonderful feeling in your body and get a sense of where the feeling starts, where it goes, and the direction it moves in. Imagine taking control over the feeling and spinning it faster and faster and stronger and stronger through your body as the feelings increase.<br>5 - Think of a time in the future where you could use these good feelings. Spin these feelings throughout your body as you think about the future and the things you are doing over the next few weeks. Don't be too surprised if you find yourself feeling really good for absolutely no reason.</p> <p>Similarly too, if you find yourself in a negative or unresourceful state, you can change your mood by changing the qualities of the feeling.<br><br>For example, think about somebody who annoys you, intimidates you, or irritates you. Make an image of him and see him look at you in whatever way he looks at you when he is annoying you. Hear him say whatever it is he says and notice the bad feeling that happens in your body.<br><br>Next, take this image and make it black and white. Move it far off into the distance. Make it much smaller, one-eighth its size. Place a clown's nose on his face. Hear him say whatever it is he says, but hear him say it in Mickey Mouse's, Donald Duck's, or Sylvester the Cat's voice. This changes the feeling you have toward him and allows you to deal with him with more confidence and effectiveness.<br><br></p> <p><strong>Changing Bad Feelings Exercise</strong></p> <p><br>1 - Think about somebody who annoys you, intimidates you, or irritates you.

The story begins when Picciolini found himself stumbling through high school, struggling to find a community among other fans of punk rock music. There, he was recruited by a notorious white power skinhead leader and encouraged to fight with the movement to "protect the white race from extinction." Soon, he had become an expert in racist philosophies, a terror who roamed the neighborhood, quick to throw fists. When his mentor was sent to prison, sixteen-year-old Picciolini took over the man's role as the leader of an infamous neo-Nazi skinhead group. <br> <br> Seduced by the power he accrued through intimidation, and swept up in the rhetoric he had adopted, Picciolini worked to grow an army of extremists. He used music as a recruitment tool, launching his own propaganda band that performed at white power rallies around the world. But slowly, as he started a family of his own and a job that for the first time brought him face to face with people from all walks of life, he began to recognize the cracks in his hateful ideology. Then a shocking loss at the hands of racial violence changed his life forever, and Picciolini realized too late the full extent of the harm he'd caused. <br> <br> "Simultaneously horrifying and redemptive" (<i>AlterNet</i>), <i>White American Youth</i> examines how radicalism and racism can conquer a person's way of life and how we can work together to stop those ideologies from tearing our world apart. <br><br> *An earlier edition of this book was published as <i>Romantic Violence</i></p><p><b>Christian Picciolini</b> is an award-winning television producer, a public speaker, author, peace advocate, and a former violent extremist. After leaving the hate movement he helped create during his youth in the 1980s and '90s, he began the painstaking process of making amends and rebuilding his life. Christian went on to earn a degree in international relations from DePaul University and launched Goldmill Group, a counter-extremism consulting and digital media firm. In 2016, he won an Emmy Award for producing an anti-hate advertising campaign aimed at helping people disengage from extremism. Christian's life since leaving the white-power movement over two decades ago has been dedicated to helping others overcome their own hate. He now leads the Free Radicals Project, a global extremism prevention and disengagement network. He has spoken all over the world, including on the TEDx stage, sharing his unique and extensive knowledge, teaching all who are willing to learn about building greater peace through empathy and compassion. Christian's involvement in, and exit from, the early American white-supremacist skinhead movement is chronicled in his memoir <i>White American Youth</i>. His disengagement work is spotlighted in his MSNBC documentary series <i>Breaking Hate</i>.

Yet few people know anything of the beliefs of the Cathars beyond vague notions that they believed in reincarnation, were vegetarians, were somehow Gnostic, and had some relation to Mary Magdalene.

Mimi Matthews answers these questions and more as she takes readers on a decade-by-decade journey through Victorian fashion and beauty history.&nbsp;</b><b></b><br>Women's clothing changed dramatically during the course of the Victorian era. Necklines rose, waistlines dropped, and Gothic severity gave way to flounces, frills, and an abundance of trimmings. Sleeves ballooned up and skirts billowed out. The crinoline morphed into the bustle and steam-moulded corsets cinched women's waists ever tighter.&nbsp;<br>As fashion was evolving, so too were trends in ladies' hair care and cosmetics. An era which began by prizing natural, barefaced beauty ended with women purchasing lip and cheek rouge, false hairpieces and pomades, and fashionable perfumes made with expensive spice oils and animal essences.&nbsp;<br>Using research from nineteenth century beauty books, fashion magazines, and lady's journals, Mimi Matthews brings the intricacies of a Victorian lady's toilette into modern day focus.

This special book helps us find that holiness."--Rabbi Harold Kushner, author of <i>When Bad Things Happen to </i><i>Good People</i></b><br><br>Death may be inevitable, but dying alone or in fear does not have to be. <i>Sacred Dying</i> is theologian Megory Anderson's essential testimonial and handbook for creating a dignified, peaceful, and more sacred end to life. Anderson includes a section with many prayers and poems from various traditions, and shows how to use personalized and creative rituals to help those dying prepare for their death and to bring a sense of peace, reconciliation, and acceptance both to themselves and to the loved ones they leave behind. She discusses all aspects of this final transition, including how to help a dying person put "unfinished business" to rest; using massage to help the dying let go of his or her body; and how to use music to help the dying focus on specific times, places, or events. For this first-ever paperback edition, she adds a chapter on what can be done after death to help move the soul along. Intended for those who are going through the death of a loved one as well as those facing death personally, Sacred Dying facilitates creating a setting where death is experienced as it should be: with honor, respect, and sacredness.<br><b>"Place [this book] on a special shelf with a few other books that you can reach for easily when the angel of death passes close. This is one book to keep at hand, because you can be sure that one day you will need it."--from the foreword by Thomas Moore</b><br><b>"Megory's work with the dying is not at all surprising. Her own journey has given her the grace to venture with others into the Mystery."--Madeleine L'Engel, author of <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i></b><br></p><p>At some point in our lives, many of us will find ourselves sitting at the bedside of a dying loved one. Thanks to Megory Anderson's <i>Sacred Dying</i>, we now have one of the most important and eloquent books available on tending to the dying. Anderson offers readers rituals and interactions to soothe and support a dying person as he or she crosses over into death. Even in situations where there is a specific religious ritual at hand--such as summoning a priest for the last sacrament--there are still many hours (and even days) that can be used to make a dying person feel spiritually and physically comforted and prepared. <p> As the founder of the Sacred Dying Foundation in San Francisco, Anderson provides real-life examples and strong storytelling to cover all aspects of dying, including how to help someone let go of "unfinished business" and how to massage a dying person to help them let go of their body. Anderson lists the tools for rituals (such as holy water, incense, and markers and paper for writing final thoughts). She even devotes an entire chapter to music--a powerful tool in healing and transcendence. Anderson offers a lovely book that covers everything you need to know to help a dying person feel deeply cared for, whether you choose to read poems aloud from the final chapters or simply sit in silence, holding the hand of a loved one. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Creating Rituals for Embracing the End of Life</b><br>From the Foreward by Thomas Moore, Author, <i>Care of the Soul</i><br>It isn't easy to live and die meaningfully in a society that has forgotten its natural religious roots. We think we're smart and sophisticated because we have outgrown the need for ritual and prayer. We have vanquished religion intellectually and are therefore surprised when, faced with death or illness or with the dying of a loved one, we don't have the answers to the basic questions. And so we have to learn all over again, remembering our traditions, if we're lucky enough to have had them, and looking for someone to help deal with mysteries we've ignored.<br>Megory Anderson covers most of the difficult questions associated with the act of dying and attendant care, and her recommendations are intelligent, inventive, and mercifully humane. She can tell us not to shock a relative by holding a drumming session at the deathbed if the relative wasn't into drumming. The basic principle here is very important: Don't confuse your own needs and enthusiasms (more often, neuroses) with the needs of the dying person. Megory is someone who obviously has a background in ritual and has spent enough years at it, with sufficient attention and skepticism, to know the real thing from the merely sentimental. I always get nervous when people talk about making up rituals, but this book, I'm happy to say, is a solid guide.<br>I've read quite a few books on dying, and one of the remarkable things that impresses me about them is how they teach me to live with care and appreciation. They are not at all morbid, and they are not for someone else.<br>They speak to me, as this book will speak to you. You can put its wisdom into practice today. After reading it for today, you can do what I have already done; Place it on a special shelf with a few other books that you can reach for easily when the angel of death passes close. This is one book to keep at hand, because you can be sure that one day you will need it.</p><h2>The Book of Ruth (New International Commentary on the Old Testament (NICOT))</h2><p>The book of Ruth contains one of the Bible's best-known and most-loved stories. This major commentary by Robert L. Hubbard Jr. shows how the author of Ruth used, with great literary artistry, the story of Ruth and Naomi to convey important theological themes.<br><br> In his introduction Hubbard discusses the issues of text, canonicity, literary criticism, authorship, date, purpose, setting, genre, legal background, themes, and theology, concluding with an outline of the book and a thorough bibliography. The commentary proper is based on Hubbard's own fresh translation and accented by copious footnotes on textual, philological, and literary matters.<br><br> Gleaning the best from recent research on Ruth, Hubbard gives the story's rich literary, grammatical, and theological dimensions a careful, rigorous treatment. He allows for the possibility that the anonymous author was a woman and argues that the narrative itself aims to counter opposition to the Davidic monarchy in Israel and Judah during Solomon's reign. Throughout, Hubbard's sensitivity to the literary genius of Ruth's author and his coherent explication of the outworking of the book's theological themes make this volume an invaluable tool for anyone desiring to explore the intriguing story of Ruth in depth.</p><p>Scholars, pastors, and serious Bible students will welcome the fresh light that this commentary series casts on ancient yet familiar biblical texts. The contributors apply their proven scholarly expertise and wide experience as teachers to illumine our understanding of the Old Testament. As gifted writers, they present the results of the best recent research in an interesting manner.Robert L. Hubbard Jr. is professor of biblical literature at North Park Theological Seminary, Chicago, and general editor of the New International Commentary on the Old Testament series.</p><h2>Visual Intelligence: How We Create What We See</h2><p><p><strong>"Don Hoffman . . . combines a deep understanding of the logic of perception, a gift for explaining it with simple displays that anyone can-quite literally-see, and a refreshing sense of wonder at the miracle of it all."--Steven Pinker, author of <em>How the Mind Works</em></strong></p> Cognitive scientist Donald Hoffman's exploration of the extraordinary creative genius of the mind's eye "has many virtues, of which sheer intellectual excitement is the foremost" (<em>Nature</em>). Hoffman explains that far from being a passive recorder of a preexisting world, the eye actively constructs every aspect of our visual experience. In an informal style replete with illustrations, Hoffman presents the compelling scientific evidence for vision's constructive powers, unveiling a grammar of vision - a set of rules that govern our perception of line, color, form, depth, and motion. Hoffman also describes the loss of these constructive powers in patients such as an artist who can no longer see or dream in color and a man who sees his father as an impostor. Finally, Hoffman explores the spinoffs of visual intelligence in the arts and technology, from film special effects to virtual reality. This is, in sum, "an outstanding example of creative popular science" (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>). 20 full-color and 130 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Visual intelligence, cognitive scientist Donald Hoffman writes, is the power that people use to "construct an experience of objects out of colors, lines, and motions." And what an underappreciated ability it is, too; despite the fact that the visual process uses up a considerable chunk of our brainpower, we're only just learning how it works. Hoffman aptly demonstrates the mysterious constructive powers of our eye-brain machines using lots of simple drawings and diagrams to illustrate basic rules of the visual road. Many of the examples are familiar optical illusions--perspective-confounding cubes, a few lines that add up to a more complex shape than seems right. Hoffman also takes a cue from Oliver Sacks, employing anecdotes about people with various specific visual malfunctions to both further his mechanical explanation of visual intelligence and drive home how important this little-understood aspect of cognition can be in our lives. An especially intriguing example involves a boy, blind from birth, who is surgically given the power to see. At first, he is completely unable to visually distinguish objects familiar by touch, such as the cat and the dog.

Using census data, penitentiary reports, and railroad company reports, Nelson reveals how John Henry, victimized by Virginia's notorious Black Codes, was shipped to the infamous Richmond Penitentiary to become prisoner number 497, and was forced to labor on the mile-long Lewis Tunnel for the C&amp;O railroad. Equally important, Nelson masterfully captures the life of the ballad of John Henry, tracing the song's evolution from the first printed score by blues legend W. C. Handy, to Carl Sandburg's use of the ballad to become the first "folk singer," to the upbeat version by Tennessee Ernie Ford.<br> Attractively illustrated with numerous images, <em>Steel Drivin' Man</em> offers a marvelous portrait of a beloved folk song--and a true American legend.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Scott Reynolds Nelson</strong> is Associate Professor of History at the College of William and Mary.

In providing a much&#x2013;needed solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet fully contemporary understanding of God, Borg&#x2013;&#x2013;author of the bestselling <em>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time</em>&#x2013;&#x2013;traces his personal journey. He leads readers from the all&#x2013;powerful and authoritarian God of his (and their) childhood and traditional faith to an equally powerful but dynamic image of God that is relevant to contemporary seekers and more biblical and spiritually authentic. Borg shows how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in delusion&#x2013;&#x2013;misinterpretation of biblical texts and of God's true nature&#x2013;&#x2013;and challenges readers to a new way of thinking about God. He opens a practical discussion about how to base a relationship with the divine both immanent and transcendant, here and now, always and everywhere. <p></p> Arguing that the authentic Judeo&#x2013;Christian tradition is that God's being includes the whole world, Borg persuasively shows how this understanding accounts for the whole variety of human religious experience. Ultimately, he introduces readers to a way of thinking about God who is "right here" all around them, rather than distant and remote. This understanding is more intellectually and spiritually satisfying and allows readers to reclaim a stronger sense of God's presence.<p></p></p><p>Answering the vital contemporary theological and spiritual questions that fall outside the scope of such popular historical bestsellers such as <i>A History of God</i> and <i>God: A Biography,</i> Marcus Borg leads us to a fresh, contemporary, yet deeply grounded experience of God in our minds--and hearts. <p>"For me, the problem was thus centrally intellectual, even though it deeply affected the rest of my life. For a variety of good reasons, not everybody experiences a serious intellectual problem with the notion of God. But some do. For my own religious journey, the resolution of the intellectual problem was indispensable; without it, I would still be on the outside of the Christian life looking in."--from <i>The God We Never Knew</i> </p><p>How to have faith--even to think about God--without having to stifle modern rational thought is one of the most vital challenges facing many of us today. Marcus Borg, author of the bestselling <i>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time,</i> traces his personal spiritual journey to the discovery of an authentic yet fully contemporary understanding of God. In a compelling, readable way, he leads us from the distant, authoritarian God of our childhood to an equally powerful, dynamic adult image of God--"the beyond in our midst," the life spirit that is within us and all around us--that reconciles faith with science, history, critical thinking, and religious pluralism.</p><p>Marcus J.

An unlikely friendship. A fateful pair of white boots. Read the classic that has captivated generations!&nbsp;</b><i><br><br> </i>It's a stroke of great luck when Harriet Johnson&#x2019;s doctor prescribes skating after an illness that has left her feeling frail and listless. For on her very first day at the rink, Harriet meets orphaned Lalla Moore, who is being brought up by her wealthy aunt Claudia to be a skating champion. Although they have little in common, the girls form a fast friendship. Harriet is energized by talented, funny Lalla, and Lalla in turn blossoms under the affection of openhearted Harriet. The girls skate together more and more. But just as Lalla&#x2019;s interest in skating starts to fade, Harriet&#x2019;s natural talent begins to emerge. Suddenly Lalla and Harriet seem headed in two very different directions. Can their friendship survive?<br><br>This beloved children's classic is the perfect gift for girls who dream of spending days at the ice rink and becoming a figure skating champion. Adult readers may remember the "Shoes" books from <i>You've Got Mail</i>!</p><p><b>Noel Streatfeild </b>wrote thirty-eight books for children, many of them inspired by her devotion to the performing arts. Her characters often consider careers on the stage, the screen, and even the ice-skating rink! She died in 1986 at the age of ninety.<p>Even when the last of the medicine bottles were cleared away and she was supposed to have &#x201c;had&#x201d; convalescence, Harriet did not get well. She was a thin child with big brown eyes and a lot of reddish hair that did not exactly curl, but had a wiriness that made it stand back from her face rather like Alice&#x2019;s hair in Alice in Wonderland. Since her illness Harriet had looked all eyes, hair, and legs, and seemed to have no face at all--so much so that her brothers Alec, Toby and Edward said she had turned into a daddy-longlegs. Mrs. Johnson, whose name was Olivia, tried to scold the boys for teasing Harriet, but her scolding was not very convincing, because inside she could not help feeling that if a daddy-longlegs had a lot of hair and big eyes it would look very like Harriet.<br> &nbsp;<br> Harriet&#x2019;s father was named George Johnson. He had a shop. It was not a usual sort of shop, because what it sold was entirely dependent on what his brother William grew, shot or caught. There had been a time when the Johnson family was rich. They had owned a large house in the country with plenty of land round it, and some fishing and shooting. The children&#x2019;s great-grandfather had not been able to afford to live in the big house, so he had built himself a smaller house on the edge of his property and rented the big house to other people. When his eldest son, the children&#x2019;s grandfather, came into the property he could not afford to live even in the new smaller house, so he brought up the children&#x2019;s father and their Uncle William in the lodge by the gates. But when he was killed in a motor accident and the children&#x2019;s Uncle William inherited the property, he was so poor he could not afford to live even in the lodge. So Uncle William decided the cheapest plan would be to live in two rooms in the house that his grandfather had built, and to rent the lodge.<br> &nbsp;<br> When he had thought of this he said to his brother George, the children&#x2019;s father, &#x201c;I tell you what, young feller me lad,&#x201d;--he was the sort of man who spoke that way--&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep a nice chunk of garden and a bit of shootin&#x2019; and fishin&#x2019; and I&#x2019;ll make the garden pay, and you can have the produce, trout from the river, and game from the woods, and keep a shop in London and sell it, and before you can say &#x2018;Bob&#x2019;s me uncle&#x2019; you&#x2019;ll be a millionaire.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It did not matter how often anyone said &#x201c;Bob&#x2019;s your uncle&#x201d; for George did not become a millionaire. Uncle William had not married, and lived very comfortably in his two rooms in the smaller house on the edge of his estate, but one reason why he lived so comfortably was that he ate the best of everything that he grew, caught or shot. The result of this was that George and Olivia and the children lived very leanly indeed on the proceeds of the shop. It was not only that William ate everything worth eating that made life so hard for them, but also that people who buy in shops expect to go to special places for special things. When they are buying fruit they do not expect to be asked if they could do with a nice rabbit or a trout, especially when the rabbit and the trout are not very nice because the best ones have been eaten by an Uncle William.<br> &nbsp;<br> The children&#x2019;s father was an optimist by nature, and he tried to believe that he could not be a failure and that anything he started would succeed in the end. He also had a deep respect and trust for his brother William.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let&#x2019;s get downhearted, Olivia,&#x201d; he would say. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all a matter of time and educating the public. The public can be educated to anything if only they&#x2019;re given time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Olivia very seldom argued with George. She was not an arguing sort of person, and anyway she was very fond of him, but she did sometimes wonder if they would not all starve before the public could be taught to buy old, tired grouse which had been too tough for Uncle William, when what they had come to buy was vegetables.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the things that was most difficult for Olivia, and indeed for the whole family, was that what would not sell had to be eaten. This made a great deal of trouble because Uncle William had a large appetite and seldom sent more than one of any kind of fish or game, and the result was that the family meals were made up of several different kinds of food, which meant a lot of cooking.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What is there for lunch today, Olivia?&#x201d; George would ask, usually adding politely, &#x201c;Sure to be delicious.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Olivia would answer, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s enough rabbit for two, there is a very small pike, there is grouse--but I don&#x2019;t really know about that, it seems to be very, very old, as if it had been dead a long time--and there&#x2019;s sauerkraut. I&#x2019;m afraid everybody must eat cabbage of some sort today. We&#x2019;ve had over seven hundred from Uncle William this week, and it&#x2019;s only Wednesday.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the worst things to Harriet about having been ill was that she was not allowed to go to school, and her mother would not let her help in the house.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do go out, darling, you look so terribly thin and spindly. Why don&#x2019;t you go down to the river? I know it&#x2019;s rather dull by yourself, but you like watching boats go by.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Harriet did like watching boats go by and was glad that her father had chosen to have his shop in outer London near the Thames, so she could see boats go by. But boat-watching is a summer thing, and Harriet was unlucky in that she had been ill all summer and was putting up with the getting-well stage in the autumn. Nobody, she thought, could want to go and look at a river in the autumn.<br><br></p></p><h2>And on Piano ...Nicky Hopkins: The Extraordinary Life of Rock&#39;s Greatest Session Man</h2><p>The Beatles.

As swiftly as it came, it disappeared, leaving no trace. Over the four decades since, Ebola has emerged sporadically, each time to devastating effect. It can kill up to 90 percent of its victims. In between these outbreaks, it is untraceable, hiding deep in the jungle. The search is on to find Ebola&#x2019;s elusive host animal. And until we find it, Ebola will continue to strike. Acclaimed science writer and explorer David Quammen first came near the virus while he was traveling in the jungles of Gabon, accompanied by local men whose village had been devastated by a recent outbreak. Here he tells the story of Ebola&#x2015;its past, present, and its unknowable future.</p><p>Extracted from <em>Spillover</em> by David Quammen, updated and with additional material.</p></p><p>David Quammen is the author of The Song of the Dodo, among other books.

However, some of these challenges are noticeably more common today, and the topic is currently of particular interest among evangelicals.<br><br>In this volume, highly regarded biblical scholar Craig Blomberg offers an accessible and nuanced argument for the Bible's reliability in response to the extreme views about Scripture and its authority articulated by both sides of the debate. He believes that a careful analysis of the relevant evidence shows we have reason to be more confident in the Bible than ever before. As he traces his own academic and spiritual journey, Blomberg sketches out the case for confidence in the Bible in spite of various challenges to the trustworthiness of Scripture, offering a positive, informed, and defensible approach.</p><p><b>Confidence in the Bible in the Face of Contemporary Challenges<br></b><br>"Mention the Bible, especially a hot topic like canon or miracles, and one second later you will hear strident voices attacking the Bible's silliness or calling others names for not believing the Bible. Those topics, and many more besides, are volatile because they matter, and what matters most for the discussion is the voice of reason and balance. Enter Craig Blomberg with nothing less than a splendid example of 'generous apologetics' for the faith. Whether you agree on specific points, this is the finest example I know of for how to defend the Bible."<br>--<b>Scot McKnight</b>, Northern Seminary<br><br>"The Bible has gone from being the answer to being the question in our culture. Can I still believe what it claims? Answering emphatically yes, Blomberg examines the pitfalls of making the Bible say too little or too much, both real problems for understanding how the Bible works. So read and consider anew how to think about Scripture. The result will be that belief in the Bible makes sense."<br>--<b>Darrell Bock</b>, Dallas Theological Seminary<br><br>"Blomberg's defense of the Scriptures' truthfulness is both important and timely. He keeps the main thing the main thing as he warns well-meaning believers about drawing rigid lines in the wrong places--and damaging the church's witness--while dispelling myths and correcting distortions propounded by Christianity's loudest critics. This book is a superb resource and guide regarding what the Bible's trustworthiness means--and doesn't mean."<br>--<b>Paul Copan</b>, Palm Beach Atlantic University<br><br>"Blomberg advances a vigorous evangelical biblical scholarship that charitably engages outsiders while courageously challenging the most strident evangelical voices, who too often preach to their choirs while alienating others from the faith. Readers of this wide-ranging work will gain a much clearer understanding of mainstream evangelical biblical scholarship."<br>--<b>Craig S.

In this beautiful volume Josie Iselin explores both the artistic and the biological presence of sixteen seaweeds and kelps that live in the thin region where the Pacific Ocean converges with the North American continent&#x2015;a place of incomparable richness. Each species receives a detailed description of its structure, ecological importance, and humans&#x2019; scientific inquiry into it, told in scientifically illuminating yet deeply reverent and inspired prose. Throughout the writings are historical botanical illustrations and Iselin&#x2019;s signature, Marimekko-like portraits of each specimen that reveal their vibrant colors&#x2015;whether rosy, &#x201c;olivaceous,&#x201d; or grass-green&#x2015;and whimsical shapes.

To solve his own demise, Stiles must travel between the two realities, each abounding with the expected confusions and unexpected plot twists for which Anthony is famous.

You know it could make a crucial difference for you, your organization, your community. You present it to the group, but get confounding questions, inane comments, and verbal bullets in return. Before you know what's happened, your idea is dead, shot down. You're furious. Everyone has lost: Those who would have benefited from your proposal. You. Your company. Perhaps even the country.<br><br>It doesn't have to be this way, maintain John Kotter and Lorne Whitehead. In Buy-In, they reveal how to win the support your idea needs to deliver valuable results. The key? Understand the generic attack strategies that naysayers and obfuscators deploy time and time again. Then engage these adversaries with tactics tailored to each strategy. By "inviting in the lions" to critique your idea--and being prepared for them--you'll capture busy people's attention, help them grasp your proposal's value, and secure their commitment to implementing the solution.<br><br>The book presents a fresh and amusing fictional narrative showing attack strategies in action. It then provides several specific counterstrategies for each basic category the authors have defined--including:<br><br>� Death-by-delay: Your enemies push discussion of your idea so far into the future it's forgotten.<br><br>� Confusion: They present so much data that confidence in your proposal dies.<br><br>� Fearmongering: Critics catalyze irrational anxieties about your idea.<br><br>� Character assassination: They slam your reputation and credibility.<br><br>Smart, practical, and filled with useful advice, Buy-In equips you to anticipate and combat attacks--so your good idea makes it through to make a positive change.<br></p><p>A good idea or the right decision needs support or it will not be accepted and implemented well. You or your allies present the plan. You present it well. Then, along with thoughtful issues being raised, come the confounding questions, inane comments, and verbal bullets-either directly at you or, even worse, behind your back. It matters not that the idea clearly makes sense. It matters not that the idea is needed, insightful, innovative, and logical. It matters not even if the issues involved are extremely important to a business, an individual, or even a nation. The proposal is still shot down, accepted but without sufficient support to gain all of its true benefits, or slowly dies a sad death. You&#39;ve been there, both on and off the job. It can be maddening. You can end up flustered, embarrassed, or furious. All those who would benefit from the idea lose. You lose. In an extreme case, a whole company or nation may lose. Buy-in demonstrates that it doesn&#39;t have to be that way.<br>John P.

Sloth is not mere laziness, however, but a disgust with reality, a loathing of our call to be friends with God, and a spiteful hatred of place and life itself. As described by Josef Pieper, the slothful person does not &#x201c;want to be as God wants him to be, and that ultimately means he does not wish to be what he really, fundamentally is.&#x201d; Sloth is a hellish despair.<p> Our own culture is deeply infected, choosing a destructive freedom rather than the good work for which God created us. Acedia and Its Discontents resists despair, calling us to reconfigure our imaginations and practices in deep love of the life and work given by God. By feasting, keeping sabbath, and working well, we learn to see the world as enchanting, beautiful, and good&#x2014;just as God sees it.</p></p><p>"In the arid wasteland that is academic writing, amid the wider desert that is modern secular thought, R.

Though Da is a small boy, his heart is big enough to share the treat with her, even though that leaves Da's family with nothing to eat for their own celebration. But the Changs' generosity doesn't go unnoticed. When they return home, they find the Kitchen God has left a wonderful surprise for them. <br> Ying Chang Compestine's heartwarming story conveys an important and poignant message about sharing and compassion.

But when Momma takes the cake out of the steamer, "something incredible happened--the rice cake came alive!" Stunned, the Changs watch as it pops out of the pan and rolls right out of their kitchen, crying, "Ai yo! I don't think so!" Much like the family in the traditional classic, <i>The Gingerbread Boy</i>, the Changs chase that pastry all through the village, but it eludes them every step--until it runs smack into an old woman. Generous Da, the youngest son, upon discovering that this woman is hungry, too, offers to share the ni�n-g�o. This leaves nothing for the Chang family's New Year's feast, but their kind-hearted deed reaps them benefits they never imagined from the approving Kitchen God.<p> Ying Chang Compestine's tale of compassion and generosity teaches a valuable, perennially fresh message. Tungwai Chau's acrylic paintings of the family celebrating their most important holiday are rich with details of traditional Chinese life.

One day, teenage martial artist Ranma Saotome went on a training mission with his father and ended up taking a dive into some cursed springs at a legendary training ground in China. Now, every time he&#x2019;s splashed with cold water, he changes into a girl. His father, Genma, changes into a panda! What&#x2019;s a half-guy, half-girl to do? <br><br>Contains volumes 7 and 8! Back when Ranma&#x2019;s father, Genma, and Akane&#x2019;s father, Soun, were young martial artists, they learned the secrets of Anything-Goes Martial Arts from one of the greatest masters of all time. Unfortunately, he&#x2019;s also someone they would do just about anything to get away from, and the entire Tendo household is about to find out why. Followed by a stirring rendition of Romeo and Juliet...and Juliet...and Romeo...</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi&#39;s career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan&#39;s annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens. Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, and One-Pound Gospel. Takahashi won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice in her career, once for Urusei Yatsura in 1981 and the second time for Inuyasha in 2002. A majority of the Takahashi canon has been adapted into other media such as anime, live-action TV series, and film.&#34;</p><h2>Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government Saving Privacy in the Digital Age</h2><p>If you've ever made a secure purchase with your credit card over the Internet, then you have seen cryptography, or "crypto", in action. From <b>Stephen Levy</b>&#x2014;the author who made "hackers" a household word&#x2014;comes this account of a revolution that is already affecting every citizen in the twenty-first century. <b>Crypto</b> tells the inside story of how a group of "crypto rebels"�nerds and visionaries turned freedom fighters�teamed up with corporate interests to beat Big Brother and ensure our privacy on the Internet. Levy's history of one of the most controversial and important topics of the digital age reads like the best futuristic fiction.</p><p>If the National Security Agency (NSA) had wanted to make sure that strong encryption would reach the masses, it couldn't have done much better than to tell the cranky geniuses of the world not to do it. Author Steven Levy, deservedly famous for his enlightening <i>Hackers</i>, tells the story of the cypherpunks, their foes, and their allies in <i>Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government</i>. From the determined research of Whitfield Diffie and Marty Hellman, in the face of the NSA's decades-old security lock, to the commercial world's turn-of-the-century embrace of encrypted e-commerce, Levy finds drama and intellectual challenge everywhere he looks. Although he writes, "Behind every great cryptographer, it seems, there is a driving pathology," his respect for the mathematicians and programmers who spearheaded public key encryption as the solution to Information Age privacy invasion shines throughout. Even the governmental bad guys are presented more as hapless control fetishists who lack the prescience to see the inevitability of strong encryption as more than a conspiracy of evil.<p> Each cryptological advance that was made outside the confines of the NSA's Fort Meade complex was met with increasing legislative and judicial resistance. Levy's storytelling acumen tugs the reader along through mathematical and legal hassles that would stop most narratives in their tracks--his words make even the depressingly silly Clipper chip fiasco vibrant. Hardcore privacy nerds will value <i>Crypto</i> as a review of 30 years of wrangling; those readers with less familiarity with the subject will find it a terrific and well-documented launching pad for further research. From notables like Phil Zimmerman to obscure but important figures like James Ellis, <i>Crypto</i> dishes the dirt on folks who know how to keep a secret. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><b>Steven Levy</b> is the author of <b>Hackers</b>, which has been in print for more than fifteen years, as well as <b>Insanely Great: The Life &amp; Times of Macintosh, the Computer That Changed Everything</b>.

She was deprived of family and friends. Her every word was&nbsp;&nbsp;programmed, her every action monitored and criticized. She was fed liquor and prescription drugs, taught to lie to get work, and relentlessly drilled to win roles. <br><br><b>The Legend:</b> Out of this nightmare emerged&nbsp;&nbsp;Patty Duke, a show business legend still searching for the child, Anna. She won three Emmy Awards and divorced three husbands. A starring role in&nbsp;<i>Valley of the Dolls</i> nearly ruined her career. She was notorious for wild spending sprees, turbulent liaisons, and an uncontrollable temper. Until a long hidden illness was diagnosed, and her amazing recovery recovery began. <br><br><b>The Triumph:&nbsp;</b><i>Call Me Anna</i> is an American success story that grew out of a bizarre and desperate struggle for survival. A harrowing, ultimately triumphant story told by Patty Duke herself&#x2014;wife, mother, political activist, President of the Screen Actors Guild, and at last, a happy, fulfilled woman whose miracle is her own life.</p><p><b>Patty Duke</b>&nbsp;(1946&#x2013;2016) was a true show business legend whose career spanned six decades.&nbsp;Her Oscar win for her role as Helen Keller in <i>The Miracle Worker&nbsp;</i>made her, at the time, the youngest Academy Award winner. She&nbsp;also entered the history books as the youngest person to have a show bearing her full name, with&nbsp;<i>The Patty Duke Show, </i>on which she played genetically unexplainable identical cousins.&nbsp;In addition to her acting, she became the second woman ever elected president of the Screen Actors Guild.ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> Though I&#x2019;ve been a professional actress since I was seven or eight, acting was never a dream of mine. What I really wanted to be was a nun: nuns were the only people I came in contact with who weren&#x2019;t drinking and screaming! I played nun a lot with my friend Margie Stravelli&#x2014;she&#x2019;d play anything. We&#x2019;d fold scarves a certain way, make a bib with paper from school, put on a bathrobe, and flick our rosary beads as we walked up and down. And then we&#x2019;d just be mean: that&#x2019;s how you played nun. Assign a lot of homework, whack the table with a ruler, fight about who was in charge. &#x201c;You were the Mother Superior last week. Let me be Mother Superior.&#x201d; We played nun for hours.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet when I think back to my earliest memory, it was of performing. It was Sundays after church and I&#x2019;d always be wearing a very good dress, looking very neat and spiffy. My father, John Patrick, would be charged with taking me to a park on Second Avenue between Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth streets on New York&#x2019;s East Side, but we never quite made it. We&#x2019;d end up instead at &#x201c;Grandpa&#x2019;s bar,&#x201d; where his father, a man with pure white hair, very blue and bloodshot eyes and that kind of handsome Irish face with all the veins sticking out from drinking too much, was a bartender. Grandpa was what they called a periodical drinker, and when he drank, my mother says, he was violent.<br> &nbsp;<br> As early as I can remember I&#x2019;d be stood on the bar and, even if it was July, I would recite &#x201c;The Night Before Christmas.&#x201d; Sometimes everyone would give me pennies, but mostly it was pretzels&#x2014;I could be bought for pretzels and Coca-Cola. Dad, of course, would be throwing back a few boiler-makers. He&#x2019;d always swear me to secrecy, but he&#x2019;d get in trouble anyway when we got home, because whether I told or not&#x2014;and I would, every time&#x2014;it was obvious where we&#x2019;d been. But I loved being hoisted up on that bar, I just loved it. And that was probably where my passion for acting began.<br> &nbsp;<br> Until I was about twelve years old, when the place got so infested with bedbugs that it drove us cuckoo, my family lived at 316 East 31 Street. The five of us (my father; my mother, Frances; my sister, Carol, who was eight years older than me; and my brother, Raymond, who was five years older) all lived in four rooms: a kitchen, a living room, and two bedrooms, all without doors. It was at the top of a four-story walkup: we lived in the back apartment and the Callahans and their dog, Scroungy, lived in the front. Scroungy was a black spaniel, so vicious it lived its entire life with a muzzle on: the Callahans would take it off only to feed the dog when nobody was around. Scroungy was mean.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though we had four rooms, none of them was as big as my den today&#x2014;you could do submarine work after living in them. The rent was only thirty-six dollars a month, but there was a panic about not being able to make the payment every time it was due. My sister and I slept in the same bed for a while, but she didn&#x2019;t like it because I moved around too much and I didn&#x2019;t like it because she talked a lot and out loud in her sleep. We had a sink, stove, refrigerator, and the washing machine my mother got her hand stuck in. Even after the machine was turned off, she kept screaming. I was just a little kid, I didn&#x2019;t know what to do. I finally figured out I should pull the plug, but I had to get Mrs. Callahan to extricate my mother&#x2019;s hand. Thank God for Mrs. Callahan. My mother might still be there.<br> &nbsp;<br> We also had pressed tin ceilings, the kind that are becoming really popular again, only these weren&#x2019;t nice and white; they had big rust stains where water had leaked through the tar-paper roof because my mother always walked on it in her high heels&#x2014;she used it for a spy tower. She&#x2019;d go up there and embarrass us to death. Maybe Ray was playing stickball in the street, where he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be, or I had my finger up my nose&#x2014;whatever it was, she&#x2019;d start screaming at the top of her lungs. Once she screamed down for Ray to come upstairs, and one of his buddies, a guy named Walter, couldn&#x2019;t take it anymore and yelled, &#x201c;Jump, Mrs. Duke, jump!&#x201d; Of course, the moment my poor brother walked in the door, she gave him a slug because of what the other kid had yelled. Well, she figured, he&#x2019;d been standing there, hadn&#x2019;t he?<br> &nbsp;<br> The neighborhood we lived in, Kips Bay, was almost all Irish and Italian. We were street-smart city kids, but the kinds of things the older ones did, like the boys shooting off firecrackers or maybe stealing hubcaps, the girls chewing gum and putting on black eyeliner because it made them look hard and tough, seem very innocent now. We never really wanted for anything, and I never remember being hungry. So tabloid stories that say &#x201c;a piece of bread seemed like birthday cake to her&#x201d; still make me furious. Sure we were poor, but we weren&#x2019;t desperate, we weren&#x2019;t like homeless people who may have nothing at all to eat. If I was hungry, it was because my mother made pea soup, which I wouldn&#x2019;t eat on a dare.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother had a strong sense of responsibility to her family. She used the phrase &#x201c;these children we brought into the world&#x201d; again and again. She prided herself on the fact that she raised perfectly clean children. People of her generation in that neighborhood had very little to be proud of, but they were proud of the way they kept a home. It was the old &#x201c;you could eat off the floor&#x201d; routine, though what my mother forgets is the reason you could eat off the floor is that my sister was washing it! The household might be threadbare, but it was sparkling clean, and her children were dressed better than lots of rich people&#x2019;s kids; my clothes were much better, much cleaner, much neater than my boys&#x2019; are today. When you&#x2019;ve got the money, you relax and say, &#x201c;Fine, wear the holes in your jeans, look like a bum.&#x201d; But when you don&#x2019;t have it, you want to look as if you do.<br> &nbsp;<br> My parents had both grown up in that same Kips Bay neighborhood before me; in fact my father&#x2019;s sister dated my mother&#x2019;s brother for a while. John Patrick Duke&#x2019;s family was Irish as far back as anyone could remember, but my mother&#x2019;s mother was German. She had eleven children and died when my mother, who was the youngest, was only six. It&#x2019;s a terrible story. Apparently my grandmother had emphysema or bronchitis, some ailment that disturbed her breathing. My aunt Lizzie was taking care of Grandma, who was choking, when the doorbell rang and kept ringing. Lizzie went to the window to see who it was&#x2014;it was little Frances&#x2014;and in the interim, before she could get back, Grandma died.<br> &nbsp;<br> When you think what an old-fashioned Irish Catholic wake on Second Avenue must have been like, with the body in the living room, all the drinking, and how many times Lizzie, not meaning to blame Frances, must have told the story about the ringing doorbell, you realize the kind of guilt my mother must have carried around all these years. I think that, and the fact that I was the youngest and smallest and looked like her, made her feel very, very close to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was born on December 14, 1946, in Bellevue Hospital, the first one of my mother&#x2019;s children who wasn&#x2019;t born at home, and named Anna Marie. The Anna is easy to figure; both my parents had sisters named Anna. Who this Marie person is, nobody knows. We figure it might have been a drinking partner of Dad&#x2019;s, or maybe he just thought another name was needed. My mother always says, &#x201c;It went good with Duke.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At first it was the classic case of the baby everyone was nice to, getting all the presents I wanted while Carol and Ray weren&#x2019;t so lucky. Though I could be a tomboy on the street, I was really a traditional little girl and played with little-girl things. I wanted books and new Crayolas and when I would color outside the line my sister would make me feel dumb. My poor sister. She says I broke everything she ever had. Well, she could play with me. I was a nice toy.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I was little, it seemed that every holiday, every event that&#x2019;s supposed to be joyous and wonderful&#x2014;Christmas, Easter, graduations, weddings, birthdays&#x2014;turned into a nightmare for my family. We were like a family out of O&#x2019;Neill, with the melancholy and the fire of the Irish. There was, for instance, the tradition of the Christmas trees always going out the window. Almost every Christmas, my father would get angry about something and there would be an argument, and before anybody knew it the tree was gone, out the window and down into the street. Years later, after my father himself was well gone and we were living in a basement apartment in the Astoria section of Queens, my mother and my brother had an argument about the tree: my mother had bought a fake one and my brother came home and freaked. There was screaming and yelling back and forth and the next thing we knew, the tree was going out the window. Except we were in the basement! Ray was so frustrated and embarrassed that he dragged the tree up the stairs and into the courtyard. So we kept the tradition alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Funerals were the big family gatherings where relatives who hadn&#x2019;t spoken to each other in fifteen years wound up in the same room. They&#x2019;d have a few too many, sparks would fly, two or three folks would beg that this wasn&#x2019;t the time or place, and then the free-for-all would begin. We&#x2019;d hear &#x201c;Step outside of Skelly and Larney&#x2019;s,&#x201d; the local funeral home, and after they&#x2019;d had it out, everything would be fine.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>DOCTOR STRANGE AND THE SORCERERS SUPREME VOL. 1: OUT OF TIME</h2><p>An ancient evil threatens to unravel the fabric of reality, and one Master of the Mystic Arts may not be enough to stop it.

She has written contemporary romantic suspense novels under that name and futuristic and historical romance novels under the pseudonyms Jayne Castle and Amanda Quick, respectively.Chapter 1<br><br> Hannah Brewster splashed the accelerant around the inside of the small cabin, working feverishly because time was running out. She was certain now that the demon would come for her that night. He had been stalking her for weeks.<br><br> She had spent many agonizing hours trying to decide what to do. In the end she had finally understood that she had no alternative but to destroy her creation. It was her only hope of keeping the promise she had made all those years ago.<br><br> She set the empty container down on the floor next to the door and picked up the box of matches. She was surprised to see that her hands were once again steady, just as if she held a brush and stood in front of an untouched canvas. Tonight she would paint a picture with fire.<br><br> Afterward they would say she was crazy, that she had finally gone over the precarious edge that separated sanity and madness. But the truth was that her mind had not been this clear in a very long time. She knew exactly what she had to do.<br><br> A few weeks ago, when the monster had come to the island the first time, she had tried to convince herself that she was hallucinating. Again. These days the past came and went in visions that were so real she often got confused. It had been twenty-two years, after all, and everyone claimed that Quinton Zane was dead.<br><br> But two weeks ago she had spotted him again. She had tried to convince herself that she could not trust her eyes. But that night she had sensed that she was being watched. She had known then that she could no longer deceive herself into thinking that she was hallucinating. The truth was always shatteringly clear at night.<br><br> At midnight she had picked up a brush, her hand firm and steady, and begun to paint her final picture. She had continued painting every night until her creation was finished.<br><br> And then she had waited for the demon to return.<br><br> For the past several days she had made the long walk into the small village every afternoon to watch the ferry dock. She stationed herself inside the shop that sold herbal teas and studied the handful of visitors who arrived. It was February and still quite chilly in the Pacific Northwest. At this time of year there was never more than a handful of tourists.<br><br> She had spotted the demon immediately, even though he had tried to disguise himself with dark glasses, a stocking cap and a black parka. He could not fool her. She might be plagued with visions, but even her hallucinations were clear and detailed. She was an artist, after all.<br><br> Quinton Zane was after the secret she had kept for so long. He was relentless. Now that he had found her, he would not stop until he forced her to give up the truth. After he had gotten what he wanted from her, he would kill her. She wasn't afraid of dying. She had, in fact, been contemplating the prospect of making the final transition ever since Abigail had died. That had been just before Christmas. But she had made a promise twenty-two years ago and she had done her best to keep the vow.<br><br> The real problem was that she feared she was not strong enough to resist Quinton Zane. The bastard could make you believe anything he wanted you to believe. She had fallen under his spell once and paid a terrible price. She could not risk getting sucked back into his web. She had a duty to protect the children. She was the only one left who could warn them.<br><br> The odor of the accelerant fumes was almost overpowering. It was time.<br><br> She struck one of the matches. When the flame was steady she stepped outside and tossed the match through the doorway of the cabin.<br><br> For a few seconds nothing happened. Unnerved at the thought of failure, she plunged her fingers into the box for a second match. At that instant the fire exploded, roaring to life. The wild flames illuminated the interior of the cabin and her final painting in a hellish light.<br><br> She watched the inferno through the doorway, studying the image with a critical eye. She had been forced to paint the picture on the wall because she had not had a large enough canvas.<br><br> The fire devoured the cabin and the painting. The heat was intense. Instinctively she moved back several more steps, welcoming the chill of the night air off the cold waters of Puget Sound.<br><br> She stood, transfixed by her act of destruction. Scenes from the past and the present fused in her mind. She thought she heard children screaming but she was certain that was a memory, not her present reality. There were no children nearby. She had chosen the cabin because of its remote location. She had been aware that her nighttime habits would disturb neighbors, even here on the island, where eccentricities were not only tolerated but also expected. Abigail had been the only one who understood and accepted her weird ways.<br><br> So, no, there were no children screaming. But her heart was pounding and her breath was tight in her chest, just as it had been that dreadful night all those years ago.<br><br> She watched the fire and waited. She was certain that he would soon appear.<br><br> Quinton Zane emerged from the dense shadows of the thick woods that surrounded the cabin. It was as if he had walked straight out of one of her paintings, straight out of the past, straight out of her nightmares.<br><br> She could not let him touch her. He was too strong, too powerful. If he got his hands on her, he would force the truth from her. She might be crazy, like everyone said, but she knew how to keep a secret.<br><br> "Stay away from me," she warned. She was amazed at the calm fortitude in her voice. "Don't touch me."<br><br> But Zane broke into a run, moving toward her. His tall figure and broad shoulders were silhouetted against the storm of flames just as they had been that long-ago night when she had watched him stride through the burning compound.<br><br> He was strong. He could easily outrun her. She would not stand a chance.<br><br> He was calling to her now, telling her to come to him, promising safety, security and an end to the visions, just as he had promised all those years ago. But she knew he lied.<br><br> She made her decision.<br><br> "You were a fool to come back," she shouted. "The key belongs to the children. Did you really think that they would forget what you did to their families? You're a dead man. You just don't know it yet."<br><br> She turned and fled into the night. Footsteps pounded behind her.<br><br> The edge of the cliffs was lit with moonlight and fire. She had walked to that edge many, many times in the years she had been living on the island. So many nights she had stopped there, looked down at the dark, deep water far below and thought about how easy it would be to take one more step.<br><br> In the past she had always turned back. But not tonight. A sense of deep certainty came over her.<br><br> She realized somewhat vaguely that she was still holding the box of matches. She would not need them anymore. She tossed them aside and kept going until there was nothing but air beneath her feet, until she was flying away from the demon.<br><br> The last thing she heard was Quinton Zane's scream of frustrated rage. She knew then that she had defeated him, at least for the moment. It was up to others to stop him. She had kept her promise and she had sent the warning. She could do no more.<br><br> She knew a split second of peace.<br><br> The dark sea took her.<br><br> Chapter 2<br><br> "You saved my life, Mr. Salinas," Virginia Troy said. "I'm embarrassed to admit that it took me this long to track you down so that I could thank you. Embarrassed to tell you that I came looking for you now only because I need your help."<br><br> "No need to apologize," Anson said. "I was just doing my job that night. You were a little kid caught up in the craziness. There was no reason you should have come looking for me as an adult."<br><br> The last time he had seen Virginia Troy she was a child of nine, one of the eight children trapped in the blazing barn. He'd used his vehicle to crash through the locked doors, tossed all eight kids into the SUV and reversed out of the inferno, a hound out of hell. Shortly after he had gotten them all to safety, the barn had collapsed in on itself.<br><br> He'd saved the kids but he and the local firefighters had not been able to save all of the adults. Virginia Troy's mother had perished, along with several other people.<br><br> Quinton Zane had kept the women away from their children at night. They had been locked in separate quarters. Zane had torched the entire compound before he vanished. It was a miracle and a tribute to the first responders that several of the cult members had made it out alive. The following morning, when they had surveyed the ruins, it was clear that Zane had not intended for any of his followers to survive. Each one was, after all, a potential witness.<br><br> "I have never forgotten what you did that night," Virginia said. "Afterward my grandparents tried very hard to erase that part of my past. The stress of losing my mother and finding themselves stuck with the task of raising me eventually broke up their marriage. My grandmother still won't talk about it. But for the rest of my life I will remember that you saved all of us who were locked up in that barn."<br><br> "Can't blame your grandparents," Anson said. He was aware of a great heaviness settling on him. "There was a lot of pain going around. You lost your mother that night. They lost a daughter."<br><br> "Yes."<br><br> Something about the bleak tone of Virginia's voice told him that she wasn't only mourning the loss of her mother all those years ago. He had a feeling that she carried another kind of burden as well. He recognized survivor's guilt when he saw it because it was close kin to the kind of guilt he felt when he looked back on that night. He had not been able to save everyone in Quinton Zane's compound.<br><br> For a while he and Virginia sat quietly, facing each other across the desk. He did not try to restart the conversation. Once upon a time he had been a cop. He understood the value of silence.<br><br> A mid-February rain beat steadily, lightly, against the windows. He had lived in Seattle for several months now, but this was his first full winter in the city. He was starting to think of it as the Season of the Deep Gray. The skies were overcast most of the time, and when the sun did make short, fitful appearances, it was low on the horizon. The weak, slanting light was often blocked by the gleaming new office towers. The boom in high-rise construction in recent years had created dark canyons in much of downtown.<br><br> It should have been depressing, he reflected. Instead, there was a sense of energy about the city. He had been surprised to discover that something in him responded to the vibe. He wasn't the only one. The region was home to innumerable start-ups. The new gig economy was going full blast. Businesses of all kinds were enthusiastic about setting up shop in the city. New restaurants and coffeehouses opened every week.<br><br> Seattle was infused with a frontier spirit. That was as true now as it had been in the gold rush and big timber eras. But these days there was a hell of a lot more money around. That, he told himself, ought to be good for the investigation business-the business in which he and two of his foster sons, Cabot and Max, were engaged.<br><br> His job was to ensure that Cutler, Sutter &amp; Salinas prospered. When the door had opened a short time ago, he'd hoped that the representative of a corporation or maybe a lawyer needing discreet services for a wealthy client would walk into the office.<br><br> Instead, Virginia Troy had entered the small reception lobby, bringing with her the long shadows of the past.<br><br> He hadn't recognized her, of course. She had been one of the youngest kids he brought out of the burning barn all those years ago-a wide-eyed little girl so traumatized by the events that she had not even been able to tell him her name for several hours. Cabot, who had been orphaned that night, had supplied him with Virginia's name.<br><br> Virginia was thirty-one now. No wedding ring, Anson noted. That did not surprise him. There was a cool reserve about her. She wasn't exactly a loner, he concluded, rather someone who was accustomed to being alone. He knew the difference.<br><br> She was the kind of woman who caught a man's eye, but not because she was a stunner. Attractive, yes, but not in a standard-issue way. She wasn't one of those too-beautiful-to-be-real women like you saw on TV. Instead there was something compelling about her, an edge that was hard to define. Probably had something to do with the bold, black-framed glasses and the high-heeled boots, he decided.<br><br> Most men wouldn't know how to handle a woman like Virginia Troy. Sure, some would be damned interested at first, maybe even see her as a challenge. But he figured that, in the end, the average guy would run for the hills.<br><br> A short time ago, when she had walked into the room, she had taken a moment to size up everything in sight, including him. He had been relieved when he and the expensive new furniture appeared to have passed inspection.<br><br> Although his name was on the door, technically speaking he was the office manager, receptionist, researcher and general gofer. Max and Cabot were the licensed investigators in the firm. Both had complained mightily about the stiff rent on the newly leased office space, as well as the money spent on furnishing the place, but Anson had refused to lower his newfound standards of interior design.<br><br> Before embarking on his career in office management, he had never paid any attention to the art of interior design. But after hiring a decorator and immersing himself in the finer points of the field, he had become convinced that the premises of the firm had to send the right message to potential clients. That meant leasing space in an upscale building and investing in quality furniture.</p><h2>The Frank Book</h2><p>Since 1991, Jim Woodring&#x2019;s lusciously rendered, hypnotic fables have dazzled readers the world over, and the recent runaway success of the Frank-co-starring graphic novel Weathercraft and the first true Frank graphic novel Congress of the Animals have only whetted readers&#x2019; appetites for more. In honor of the characters&#x2019; 20th anniversary and first graphic-novel length story, The Congress of the Animals, Fantagraphics is re-releasing the massive The Frank Book, which collects all the Frank material up to the mid-aughts, including several jaw-droppingly beautiful full-color stories, literally dozens of lushly-delineated black-and-white stories, and a treasure trove of covers and illustrations &#x2015; both in a new printing of the hardcover for bibliophiles, and the first edition of a new softcover for those on a budget.</p><p>Jim Woodring lives on Vashon Island in Washington State&#x2019;s Puget Sound with his wife, Mary. The recipient of numerous rewards&#x2015;including a Genius Award&#x2015;he is an animator and a fine artist as well as a cartoonist.Woodring, a modern master of hallucinatory cartoon fables, specializes in comics that look normal but aren't. Woodring's hallmarks are inventive, often bizarre creatures who inhabit otherworldly landscapes and dreamlike narratives. This book's hero, Frank, is a catlike anthropomorph who lives in a surreal, exotic world. Woodring uses cartoon grammar brilliantly: within a single panel, he captures the round, loose style of classic animated cartoons and conjures the best of early Disney, while simultaneously acting as master engraver, with a quality of line work and elegant shading reminiscent of Gustave Dore. Many of the stories are in b&amp;w, but when color appears, the palette is a cheerful kaleidoscope. For director Coppola, Woodring's work is magical and "maliciously oblique." While innocent Frank is principally defined by his curiosity, he isn't without guile. The mostly wordless vignettes chronicling his misadventures are actually meditations on friendship, fear, consequence and cruelty, with a mixture of pathos, humor and gore that is often disquieting. His escapades also include a recurring parade of characters: Pushpaw, Frank's faithful pet; the repulsive Manhog, perennially unlucky liege of Whim (a sinister figure with a devilish barbed tail); Faux Pa and Real Pa; and the Jerry Chickens, geometrically shaped fowl who play cards. Woodring's talent is finally captured in a definitive collection that lives up to his genius. The production and design make it an outstanding gift for enthusiasts, and it assembles all the Frank material since the 1991 debut, including covers, illustrations, trading cards and ephemera for the completist. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Holman QuickSource Bible Atlas</h2><p><p>It's the quickest way to get the big picture.

But a significant non-Celtic influence on Scotland&#39;s history has been largely ignored for centuries? This book argues that much of Scotland&#39;s history and culture from 1100 forward is Jewish. The authors provide evidence that many of the national heroes, villains, rulers, nobles, traders, merchants, bishops, guild members, burgesses, and ministers of Scotland were of Jewish descent, their ancestors originating in France and Spain. Much of the traditional historical account of Scotland, it is proposed, rests on fundamental interpretive errors, perpetuated in order to affirm Scotland&#39;s identity as a Celtic, Christian society. A more accurate and profound understanding of Scottish history has thus been buried. The authors&#39; wide-ranging research includes examination of census records, archaeological artifacts, castle carvings, cemetery inscriptions, religious seals, coinage, burgess and guild member rolls, noble genealogies, family crests, portraiture, and geographic place names.</p><p>Elizabeth Caldwell Hirschman is a professor of marketing at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey and a professor at the University of Virginia-Wise.

Southwest Airlines is perhaps the most visible practitioner, soaring through economic downturns while its competitors slash their budgets and order massive layoffs, but you can find other pioneers of the new approach in almost every industry and market niche. Their secret: a culture of ownership that allows them to tap into the most underutilized resource in business today&#x2013;namely, the enthusiasm, intelligence, and creativity of working people everywhere.<br><br>No one knows more about building a culture of ownership than CEO Jack Stack, who&#x2019;s been working on one for the past twenty years with his colleagues at SRC Holdings Corporation (formerly Springfield ReManufacturing Corporation). Along the way, they&#x2019;ve turned their company into what <i>Business Week</i> has called a &#x201c;management Mecca,&#x201d; attracting thousands of people representing hundreds of businesses to SRC&#x2019;s home in Springfield, Missouri. There the visitors learn how to incorporate the ideals and values of SRC&#x2019;s remarkable corporate culture into their own organizations&#x2013;and then they go back and do it.<br><br>Now, in <i>A Stake in the Outcome</i>, Stack offers a master class on creating a culture of ownership, presenting the hard-won lessons of his own twenty-year journey and explaining what it really takes to build for long-term success. The pioneer of &#x201c;open-book management&#x201d; (described in the best-selling classic <i>The Great Game of Business</i>), Stack and twelve other managers began their journey in 1982, when they purchased their factory from its struggling parent company. SRC grew 15 percent a year, while adding almost a thousand new jobs, and the company&#x2019;s stock price rocketed from 10 cents to $81.60 per share. In the process, Stack discovered that long-term success required constant innovation&#x2013;and that building a culture of ownership involved much more than paying bonuses, handing out stock options, or setting up an employee stock ownership plan. <b>In a successful ownership culture, every employee had to take the fate of the company as personally as an individual owner would.</b> Achieving that level of commitment was extraordinarily difficult, but Stack realized that the payoff would be enormous: a company that was consistently able to outperform the market.<br><br><i>A Stake in the Outcome </i>isn&#x2019;t about theory&#x2013;it&#x2019;s about practice. Stack draws from his own successes and failures at SRC to show how any company can teach its employees to think and act like owners, including how to implement an effective equity-sharing program, how to promote continuous learning at every level of the organization, how to fire up employees&#x2019; competitive juices, how to broaden the concept of leadership and delegate responsibility for the business, and how to build a workforce that is fast on its feet and ready to take advantage of every opportunity. You&#x2019;ll also learn about other companies that have succeeded in building cultures of ownership&#x2013;and the lessons they can teach the rest of us.<br><br>Written in Jack Stack&#x2019;s straightforward, witty, no-beating-around-the-bush style, <i>A Stake in the Outcome</i> is like having a one-on-one session with a master entrepreneur and business innovator. It shows managers and executives of companies both large and small how to build a ferociously motivated workforce that is energized and committed to meeting and overcoming the most daunting challenges a company can face.</p><p><b>JACK STACK</b> is President and CEO of SRC Holding Corporation, an employee-owned company that supplies remanufactured engines to the transportation industries. He lives in Springfield, Missouri. <b>BO BURLINGHAM</b> is an editor-at-large of <i>Inc</i>. magazine and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They are the authors of the bestseller <i>The Great Game of Business</i>.1 A Culture of Ownership<br><br>There's a great experiment going on in business today that involves literally thousands of companies and millions of people, but it's one of the best-kept secrets around. I know about the experiment because my company, SRC Holdings Corporation (formerly Springfield ReManufacturing Corporation), is part of it. For twenty years now, my colleagues and I have been trying to develop a particular type of culture at SRC. In the process, we've come into contact with thousands upon thousands of people who are trying to do the same thing at their companies. <br><br>A lot of those people have visited us in southwestern Missouri. By conservative estimates, we've had more than 4,600 people from 1,600 companies come to see what we're doing and learn about the Great Game of Business, the management system we've developed to teach everybody in our company about business and to turn our employees into owners. That's prompted <i>Business Week</i> to label SRC a "management Mecca." Another 5,000 people from 1,700 companies have attended the various conferences we hold for current and would-be practitioners of open-book management, which is the generic term for what we do. There we've been joined by our kindred spirits in the corporate world, including some of the most revered companies around--Southwest Airlines, Harley-Davidson, VeriFone, Outback Steakhouse, AES Corp., Whole Foods Market, Kingston Technology, and ServiceMaster, to name a few.<br><br>Meanwhile, the book we wrote about our management system in 1992 has sold more than 200,000 copies and been translated into Russian, Spanish, Hungarian, Chinese, and Korean. People have applied the principles of the Game to an awesome array of businesses--from oil companies to hair salons, from Internet start-ups to roller coaster manufacturers, from fast-food chains to law firms, landscapers, mining operations, even not-for-profit social service organizations.<br><br>Not just in the United States, either. SRC has become famous in places we once barely knew existed. There are companies in Zambia and Malaysia that practice the Great Game of Business. The Australian <i>60 Minutes </i>did a segment on our company, and it became one of the program's most requested videotapes. Delegations have come to see us from as far away as India, South Africa, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Japan, wherever--all interested in finding out as much as they can about the way we do business.<br><br>At a certain point, you have to ask yourself, Why? What could all these people be looking for, and why would they trek all the way to the Ozarks to find it? I like to think of SRC as a leading-edge business, but let's face it: We're not a high-flying star of technology, and we don't live in a hot zone of the new economy, or even a major metropolitan area. While we have our own Internet-based subsidiary, most of the companies we operate are involved in the making and selling of engines and engine components, an old-economy industry if there ever was one. <br><br>Nor can you explain the interest by our business sucess alone. Yes, we've done well. A share of SRC stock that was worth 10 cents in 1983, the year we started, had an appraised value of $81.60 as of January 31, 2001, and increase of 816, 000 percent in eighteen years. During that time, we've grown from $16 million to $160 million in sales; from 119 to more than 900 employees; and from one company to 22. After losing $60,000 in our first year, we've had seventeen straight years of unbroken profits. It's a good record, and I'm proud of it, but many companies can marshal equally impressive growth statistics, and they don't all acquire the kind of notoriety that we have.<br><br>There are some other numbers, however, that I suspect get closer to explaining why people come to Springfield to see us. When we started in 1983, we had just thirteen shareholders--me and the twelve other managers who'd scrounged around and come up with the $100,000 we needed to make a down payment on the factory where we worked. Today we have 727 shareholders, all employees, just five of whom have stock from the original buyout. The other 722 shareholders own 64 percent of the business, valued at $23 million.<br><br>That transfer of ownership is the result of an odyssey we began two decades ago. During that time, we've worked long and hard to foster an environment that brings out the best in people, giving them the confidence, the courage, and the self-esteem to do what they're capable of. How? Mainly by trying to be as loyal to them as they've been to the business by creating a place where they can feel more secure.<br><br>There's a level of mutual trust and respect at SRC that doesn't exist in a lot of companies. It comes from everything we've done to build our culture. It comes from being honest with people, from telling them about the realities of business, from having principles and sticking by them, from trying to be fair. I suppose it's also important that we've avoided mass layoffs, but it's more important that we've done it together, by keeping our promises to one another, by living up to our mutual commitments. We've treated people like the capable, intelligent adults we know they are. We haven't protected them like children. We've created a society built around rules we all know and understand--some of which we've developed, but many of which we've gotten from the marketplace. They're the basic rules of business, the things we have to do to survive and prosper in a competitive economy.<br><br>Out of all this has emerged a special kind of corporate culture--what I think of as a culture of ownership. It's that culture, I believe, that is drawing all those people to Springfield. They want to see it, feel it, smell it, taste it, and they want to find out how to create something similar in their own companies.<br><br><b>The Definition of a Culture<br><br></b>So what exactly is a culture of ownership, and where does it come from? The term, I admit, is tricky to define. It&#x2019;s a little like what a Supreme Court justice once said about pornography: It&#x2019;s hard to say exactly what it is, but you know when you see it. By that standard, if no other, we can all think of companies we&#x2019;re familiar with that have an ownership of culture. Southwest Airlines comes to mind. Harley-Davidson and Home Depot do as well. So, for that matter, do Herman Miller, the $2.2 billion furniture maker, and Whole Foods Market, the $1.8 billion natural foods grocery chain, and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), the $5.9 billion, employee-owned defense contractor.<br><br>Each of those companies has a distinctive corporate culture you quickly become aware of when you walk into one of their facilities or spend time with their employees. There&#x2019;s a sense of pride, identity, direction, and purpose. People know they&#x2019;re part of something bigger than what they do on a day-to-day basis. They belong to something, and it belongs to them. They have ownership, and it&#x2019;s a two-way street.<br><br>But while most people can recognize an ownership culture when they see it, they have many misconceptions about what it takes to develop one. There&#x2019;s a common belief, for example, that it&#x2019;s all about owning stock. Equity-sharing certainly plays a crucial role, but you don&#x2019;t get an ownership culture simply by giving stock to employees. We&#x2019;ve seen a lot of that in recent years, and more often that not the result has been disappointment and misunderstanding.<br><br>Part of the problem has been the tendency of companies to use stock merely as a form of compensation&#x2013;a carrot to get people to work harder. In a company with a strong culture of ownership, stock is more than compensation. First and foremost, it&#x2019;s a vehicle for change. The goal is not just to reward people for the work they do, or to maximize profits for their own sake, or to enhance shareholder value, improve cash flow, whatever. Rather equity is used to involve people in the process of making a difference in the world.<br><br>Why? Because business is not an end itself. It&#x2019;s a means to an end. It&#x2019;s a tool that allows us to accomplish the things that matter most to us, and those things must transcend business to have real meaning and value. The precise nature of those loftier goals will vary from company to company, even from person to person, but you must have them. They are what makes ownership worth caring about.<br><br>And to be an owner, a true owner, you have to care. Owners do not follow a job description. They don&#x2019;t just put in their time. They have something bigger they&#x2019;re working toward, and they feel a sense of responsibility about accomplishing it. They go beyond mere problem solving and look for creative, innovative ways to reach their goals. They are independent-minded, freethinking people, leaders not followers, and they know how to take the bad with the good. Indeed, they&#x2019;re often at their best when the going gets tough. They have what it takes to reach down and find the inner sources of strength that allow them to keep moving forward, no matter what gets in their way.<br><br>At SRC, we wanted to have a culture that would draw out those qualities in the people who work here. But to build such a culture&#x2013;and to sustain it&#x2013;you must also have a company that comes on the promises it makes to its employees. It&#x2019;s relatively easy to create an illusion of ownership by handing out stock or stock options. It&#x2019;s far more difficult to give people the tools they need to realize the rewards that ownership can provide.<br><br>We&#x2019;ve been trying to figure out how to do that for the entire time we&#x2019;ve been in business. It has been a long, slow, difficult journey, filled with pitfalls and obstacles, and we haven&#x2019;t yet reached the end of it. Perhaps you never do. But we&#x2019;ve been able to overcome a lot of the obstacles, mainly because we&#x2019;ve put so much effort into teaching people about business, creating mechanisms that have allowed them to learn about the complexities of ownership as they&#x2019;ve been engaged in the process of building an enduring company.<br><br>Those mechanisms are the building blocks of the Great Game of Business.<br><br><b>Continuous Learning <br><br></b>I want to be clear about what I mean by the word <i>mechanism</i>. I&#x2019;m talking here about a regular process, program, or routine that has become an integral part of our management system&#x2013;our 10-20-30-40 bonus program, for example, our high-involvement planning process, or our weekly hurdles. We wrote about several mechanisms (including those three) in our first book, <i>The Great Game of Business</i>. Since then, we&#x2019;ve developed several more, some of which we&#x2019;ll discuss later on in this book.<br><br>All of these mechanisms serve more than one function. To begin with, they&#x2019;re management tools. The bonus program provides incentives to achieve certain goals; the planning process produces an annual plan; the huddles are essential means of communication; and so on. <br><br>In addition, the mechanisms allow us to delegate a tremendous amount of authority and responsibility by giving people the information they need to make decisions that are in the best interests of the company, both short and long term. <br><br>Then, too, the mechanisms embody our values and transmit our culture to new employees. With the weekly huddles, the scoreboards and charts on the walls, the constant chatter about hitting targets, it doesn&#x2019;t take long for someone to figure out what we stand for.<br><br>Those are all valuable functions, and I could probably come up with others. It&#x2019;s important to understand, however, that by far the most critical function of the Great Game mechanisms is education. They are the tools we use to promote continuous learning in every corner of the organization. They are the means by which we make informal business training a regular part of our day-to-day routines. <br><br>Let me say a few words here about informal training, which I&#x2019;ve always found to be better, cheaper, and more effective than formal training.<br><br>I like to use a fishing analogy. You can do all the research in the world on bass fishing. You can find teachers who&#x2019;ll tell you everything they know. You can read every fishing magazine, study every fishing book, and watch Jimmy Houston on ESPN. But it won&#x2019;t mean anything until you go on a lake and start throwing a lure. When you feel that first bite&#x2013;or have the first backlash&#x2013;you&#x2019;ll begin to learn about fishing.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not saying that formal instruction is worthless, just that it&#x2019;s over-rated. According to an authoritative study conducted by the Center for Workforce Development, formal training programs account for only about 30 percent of what people know about their jobs. The rest they pick up informally from the people they work with&#x2013;at the coffee machine, in the lunchroom, during breaks on the floor.<br><br>Those findings aren&#x2019;t as surprising as they may seem at first glance. Think about how it works in most organizations. When new people come in, they usually get some kind of job orientation. Somebody explains their benefits and tells them what&#x2019;s expected on the job. But who gives them their <i>real </i>orientation? How do they find out what&#x2019;s <i>really</i> expected? They learn, right, but not in any formal training session. I&#x2019;m reminded of a story I heard once from a guy who worked in a giant automobile factory. I&#x2019;d asked him how new employees find out what they have to do to be successful. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s real simple,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Somebody tells them, &#x2018;Keep your nose clean for ninety days, and you&#x2019;ll have a job for life.&#x201d;&#x2019; Talk about transmitting a culture.<br><br>The point is that job-related learning goes on whether or not we&#x2019;re aware of it. People learn through a whole series of events that most companies don&#x2019;t even recognize, and so they never figure out how to leverage the process. They don&#x2019;t see how much training you can do outside of any formal training program.<br><br>I believe that people learn when they participate in games or work in teams. People learn when they have meetings or interact with customers. When you talk with your supervisor, you learn. When you mentor another employee, you learn. When you report to your peers, you learn. When you come up with a replacement so that you can move on to another job, you learn. <br><br>That&#x2019;s the informal training process. Through it, people learn interpersonal skills&#x2013;how to communicate, how to handle themselves in a group, how to deal with different personalities. They learn to fit into the company&#x2019;s culture, how to live up to expectations. They learn how to innovate, how to create new products and services. They acquire the practical skills they need to do a particular job, as well as the mental skills they can use wherever they go: the ability to solve problems, to think critically, to integrate task, to compete and win. Some people are extraordinary at winning. Why? Mainly because they&#x2019;ve learned how&#x2013;through informal training.<br><br>This is a critical point that, for some reason, I have a hard time getting across to people who want to understand the success of our management system. They focus on the design of the bonus program, or the selection of a critical number. They think it&#x2019;s all about finding the right incentives. Wrong<i>. It&#x2019;s all about leveraging the informal training process, using the regular routines of the company to promote continous learning. </i>A bonus program may help you hit certain goals and put some money in the pockets of your employees, but you&#x2019;ll miss the greatest potential benefit if you don&#x2019;t make the connection to learning.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t believe you can build a durable ownership culture without some such system of ongoing business education. Nobody can think and act like an owner without understanding the basic rules of business, and to teach people those rules. We start with the idea that there are two things every company must do to stay in b...</p><h2>Splicing Modern Ropes: A Practical Handbook</h2><p><p><b>The definitive guide to making strong, reliable splices in braided rope, using step-by-step photographs and clear instructions to help readers master this important but tricky skill.</b></p><p>The time when every vessel going to sea made use of three-strand rope has gone.

In place of the old, poorly maintained apartments and dense streetscapes of taverns and butchers, &#x201c;rehabbers&#x201d; imagined a new kind of neighborhood&#x2015;a renovated, modern community that held on to the convenience, diversity, and character of a historic urban quarter, but also enjoyed the prosperity and privileges of a new subdivision.<br><br>But as the old buildings came down, cheap studios were combined to create ever more spacious, luxurious homes. Property values rose swiftly, and the people who were evicted to make room for progress began to assert their own ideas about the future of Lincoln Park. Over the course of the 1960s, divisions within the community deepened. Letters and picket lines gave way to increasingly violent strikes and counterstrikes as each camp tried to settle the same existential questions that beguile so many cities today: Who is this neighborhood for? And who gets to decide?</p><p>Daniel Kay Hertz has written about urban issues for a number of outlets, including City Observatory, The Atlantic, Chicago Magazine, South Side Weekly, and the Chicago Reader.

In exchange for a bag of money and four cows, Alemayu accepts a challenge from his sister's boastful, rich employer to spend the night alone on a mountain with minimal clothing and without a fire. He survives the bitterly cold night by concentrating on a shepherd's fire across the way on another mountain. The haughty man refuses to pay him, stating that looking at someone else's fire is the same as building one's own-until the siblings devise a plan that allows the man to see the foolishness of his reasoning.

He was only here as a favor to his Aunt Destiny. He'd promised to give some supposedly brilliant marketing whiz kid a chance at the consultant's contract for the family corporation's public relations campaign despite her lack of experience working with a major worldwide conglomerate.<br><br>He was also looking for a consultant who could help him launch his first political campaign. His intention had been to hire someone more seasoned than this woman Destiny was recommending, but his aunt was very persuasive when she put her mind to something.<br><br>"Just meet with her. Have a nice lunch. Give her a chance to sell <em>you</em> on her talent. After all," Aunt Destiny had said with a suspicious gleam in her eye, "nobody on earth is a tougher sell than you, right?"<br><br>Richard had given his aunt a wry look. "You flatter me."<br><br>She'd patted his cheek as if he were twelve again and she was trying to call attention gently to one of his flaws. "Not really, darling."<br><br>Destiny Carlton was the bane of his existence. He doubted if there was another aunt like her in the universe. When he was barely twelve, she'd breezed into his life twenty-four hours after his parents' small plane had crashed in the fog-shrouded Blue Ridge Mountains.<br><br>His father's older sister, Destiny had lived a nomad's life, cavorting with princes in European capitals, gambling in Monaco, skiing in Swiss Alpine resorts, then settling into a farmhouse in Provence where she'd begun painting more seriously, eventually selling her works in a small gallery on Paris's Left Bank. She was exotic and eccentric and more fun than anyone Richard or his younger brothers had ever met. She'd been just what three terrified little boys had needed.<br><br>A selfish woman would have scooped them up and taken them back to France, then resumed her own life, but not Destiny. She had plunged into unexpected motherhood with the same passionate enthusiasm and style with which she embraced life. She'd turned their previously wellordered lives into a chaos of adventures in the process, but there had never been a doubt in their minds that she loved them. They, in turn, adored her, even when she was at her most maddening, as she had been lately, ever since she'd gotten some bee in her bonnet about the three of them needing to settle down. To her despair, he, Mack and Ben had been incredibly resistant to her urgings.<br><br>Over the years, despite Destiny's strong influence, Richard had clung tenaciously to the more somber lessons of his father. Work hard and succeed. Give back to the community. Be somebody. The adages had been drilled into him practically from infancy. Even at twelve, he'd felt the weight of responsibility for the generations-old Carlton Industries sitting squarely on his thin shoulders. Though an outsider had held the temporary reins upon his father's death, there was no question that the company would eventually be Richard's to run. A place would have been found for his brothers as well, if either of them had wanted it. But neither had shown the slightest interest, not back then and not now.<br><br>Back then, while his brothers had gone home after school to play their games, Richard had taken the family obligation to heart. Every weekday he'd gone to the historic old brick building that housed the corporate offices.<br><br>Destiny had tried her best to interest him in reading novels of all kinds, from the classics to science fiction and fantasy, but he'd preferred to scour the company books, studying the neatly aligned columns of figures that told the story of decades of profit and loss. The order and logic of it soothed him in a way he had been helpless to explain to her or to anyone. Even now, he had a better understanding of business than he did of people.<br><br>When he was twenty-three and had his M.B.A. from the prestigious Wharton School of Business, Richard slipped into the company presidency without raising so much as an eyebrow among the employees or among the worldwide CEOs with whom Carlton Industries did business. Most assumed he'd been all but running it behind the scenes since his father's death, anyway. Even as a kid, he'd displayed amazing confidence in his own decision-making.<br><br>Now, at thirty-two, he had the company on the track his father would have expected, expanding bit by bit with a strategic merger here, a hostile acquisition there. He was still young, successful and one of the city's most eligible bachelors. Unfortunately, his relationships tended to be brief once the women in his life realized they were always likely to take a back seat to the pressing&#x2014;and often far more interesting&#x2014;needs of the family company. The last woman he'd dated had told him he was a cold, dispassionate son of a bitch. He hadn't argued. In fact, he was pretty sure she had it just about right. Business never let him down. People did. He stuck to what he could trust.<br><br>Since he'd been so unsuccessful at romance, he'd turned his attention elsewhere in recent months. He'd been considering a run for office, perhaps the Alexandria City Council for starters. His father had expected all of his sons to climb to positions of power, not just in the corporate world, but in their community and the nation. Helping to shape Richard's image and get his name into print as a precursor to this was just part of what his new marketing consultant would be handling.<br><br>His timetable&#x2014;okay, his father's oft-expressed timetable&#x2014;for this was right on track, too. His father had espoused the need for short-term and long-term strategic planning. Richard had doubled the number of years his father had planned ahead for. He liked knowing where he should be&#x2014;where he <em>would</em> be&#x2014;ten, twenty, even thirty years down the road.<br><br>For someone whose precise schedule was so detailed, wasting precious minutes out of his jam-packed day waiting for a woman who was now twenty minutes late pretty much drove him crazy. Out of time and out of patience, Richard snapped his fingers. The maitre d' appeared instantly.<br><br>"Yes, Mr. Carlton?"<br><br>"Could you put my coffee on my account, please, Donald? My guest hasn't arrived, and I have another appointment to get to back at my office."<br><br>"No charge for the coffee, sir. Would you like the chef to box up a salad?"<br><br>"No, thanks."<br><br>"Shall I get your coat, then?"<br><br>"Didn't wear one."<br><br>"Then at least let me call a taxi for you. It's started to snow quite heavily. The sidewalks and streets are treacherous. Perhaps that's why your guest is late."<br><br>Richard wasn't interested in finding excuses for the no-show, just in getting back to work. "If the weather's that bad, I can walk back sooner than you can get a taxi here. Thanks, anyway, Donald. And if Ms. Hart ever shows up, please tell her..." His voice trailed off. He decided the message he'd like to have relayed was better left unsaid. It was bound to come back to haunt him with his aunt, who was one of Donald's favorite customers. Though he considered his duty to Destiny's young friend done, his aunt might not see it the same way. "Just tell her I had to go."<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>He opened the front door of the restaurant, stepped outside onto the slick sidewalk and ran straight into a battering ram. If he hadn't had a firm grip on the door, he'd have been on the ground. Instead, the woman who'd hit him headfirst in the midsection, stared up at him with huge, panicked brown eyes fringed with long, dark lashes just as her feet skidded out from under her.<br><br>Richard caught her inches from the icy ground and steadied her. Even though she was bundled up for the weather, she felt delicate. A faint frisson of something that felt like protectiveness hit him. It was something he'd previously experienced only with his younger brothers and his aunt. Most of the women in his life were so strong and capable, he'd never felt the least bit inclined to protect them from anything.<br><br>The woman closed her eyes, then opened them again and winced as she surveyed his face. "Please don't tell me you're Richard Carlton," she said, then sighed before he could respond. "But of course you are. You look exactly like the picture your aunt showed me.<br><br>"That's the way my day has gone," she rattled on. "First I get a cab driver who couldn't find his way to the corner without a map, then we get stuck behind a trash truck and then the snow starts coming down worse than a blizzard in the Rockies." She gazed at him hopefully, brushing at a stray strand of hair that was teasing at her still pink cheek. "I don't suppose you'd like to go back in, sit down and let me make a more dignified entrance?"<br><br>Richard bit back a sigh of his own. "Melanie Hart, I presume."<br><br>She gazed at him, her expression thoughtful. "I could pretend to be somebody else, and we could forget all about this unfortunate incident. I could call your office later, apologize profusely for missing you, make another appointment and start over in a very businesslike way."<br><br>"You're actually considering lying to me?"<br><br>"It would be a waste of time, wouldn't it?" she said with apparent regret. "I've already given myself away. I knew this whole lunch thing was a mistake. I make a much better impression in a conference room. I think it's the setting. People tend to take you more seriously if you can use an overhead projector and all sorts of charts and graphs. Anyway, I told Destiny that, but she insisted lunch would be better. She says you're less cranky on a full stomach."<br><br>"How lovely of her to share that," Richard said, vowing to have yet another wasted talk with his aunt about discussing him with anyone and everyone. If he did decide to run for office, her loose tongue would doom his chances before he got started.<br><br>"I don't suppose your stomach's full now?" Melanie Hart asked hopefully.<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Then you're bound to be cranky, so I'll just slip on inside and try to figure out how I managed to mess up the most important job interview of my entire life."<br><br>"If you decide you want an outside opinion, give me a call," Richard said.<br><br>He considered brushing right on past this walking disaster, but she looked so genuinely forlorn he couldn't seem to bring himself to do it. Besides, Destiny had said she was very good at what she did, and Destiny was seldom wrong about personnel matters. She was a good judge of people, at least when she didn't let emotion cloud her judgment. Richard very much feared this was one of those instances when her heart might have overruled her head. Still...<br><br>He tucked a hand under Melanie Hart's elbow and steered her inside. "Thirty minutes," he said tersely as Donald beamed at them and led them back to the table Richard had vacated just moments earlier. It had a fresh tablecloth, fresh place settings and a lit candle. He was almost certain that candle hadn't been there before. He had a suspicious feeling Donald had been expecting him back all along and had hoped a little atmosphere would improve his sour mood. No doubt the maitre d' and his aunt were in cahoots. He'd probably called Destiny with a report five seconds after Richard had walked out.<br><br>When Donald had brought a fresh pot of coffee, Richard glanced at his watch. "Twenty-four minutes, Ms. Hart. Make 'em count."<br><br>Melanie reached for her attach� case and promptly knocked over her water glass...straight into his lap.<br><br>Richard leaped up as the icy water soaked through his pants. The day was just getting better and better.<br><br>"Oh, my God, I am so sorry," Melanie said, on her feet, napkin in hand, poised to sop up the water.<br><br>Richard considered letting her do it, just to see how she reacted once she realized exactly where she was touching him, but apparently she caught on to the problem. She handed the napkin to him.<br><br>"Sorry," she said again while he spent several minutes trying to dry himself off. "I swear to you that I am not normally such a klutz." At his doubtful look, she added, "Really, I'm not."<br><br>"If you say so."<br><br>"If you want to leave, I will totally understand. If you tell me never to darken your door, I'll understand that, too." Her chin came up and she looked straight into his eyes. "But you'll be making a terrible mistake."<br><br>She was a bold one, no question about that. Richard paused in his futile attempt to dry his trousers. "How so?"<br><br>"I'm exactly what you need, Mr. Carlton. I know how to get attention."<br><br>"Yes, I can see that," he said wryly. "There's unforgettable and then there's disastrous. I'm hoping for something a little more positive."<br><br>"I can do that," she insisted. "I have the contacts. I'm clever and innovative. I know exactly how to sell my clients to the media. In fact, I have a preliminary plan right here for your campaign and for Carlton Industries."<br><br>When she started to reach for her attach� case again, Richard grabbed the remaining water glass on the table and moved it a safe distance away, then sat back down while she scattered a flurry of papers in every direction. When she was finally done, he said, "I appreciate your enthusiasm, Ms. Hart, I really do, but this isn't going to work." To avoid hurting her feelings, he tried to temper his dismissal. "I need someone a little more seasoned."<br><br>He refrained from adding that he wanted someone less ditzy, someone a little less inclined to remind him with every breath that she was a female and that he was a male who hadn't had sex for several months now. He did not need an employee who stirred up all these contradictory reactions in him. In this day and age that was a lawsuit waiting to happen.<br><br>His response to Melanie Hart bemused him. He'd gone from annoyance to anger to attraction in the space of&#x2014;he glanced at his watch&#x2014;less than twenty-five minutes. Relieved that her allotted time was nearly over, he tapped his Rolex. "Time's about up, Ms. Hart. Nice to meet you. I wish you luck and best success."<br><br>She gave him that forlorn, doe-eyed look that made his stomach clench and his pulse gallop erratically.<br><br>"You're kissing me off, aren't you?" she said.<br><br>It was an unfortunate turn of phrase. Richard suddenly couldn't stop looking at her mouth, which was soft and full and very, very kissable. He obviously needed to find the time to start dating again, if he was going to react this way to a woman as wildly inappropriate as Melanie Hart.<br><br>"I wouldn't put it that way," he said finally.

An animal control officer had found a neglected donkey on a farm in upstate New York, and she hoped that Jon and his wife, Maria, would be willing to adopt him. Jon wasn&#x2019;t planning to add another animal to his home on Bedlam Farm, certainly not a very sick donkey. But the moment he saw the wrenching sight of Simon, he felt a powerful connection. Simon touched something very deep inside of him. Jon and Maria decided to take him in.<br><br> Simon&#x2019;s recovery was far from easy. Weak and malnourished, he needed near constant care, but Jon was determined to help him heal. As Simon&#x2019;s health improved, Jon would feed him by hand, read to him, take him on walks, even confide in him like an old and trusted friend. Then, miraculously, as if in reciprocation, Simon began to reveal to Jon the true meaning of compassion, the ways in which it can transform our lives and inspire us to take great risks.<br><br> This radically different perspective on kindness and empathy led Jon to a troubled border collie from Ireland in need of a home, a blind pony who had lived outside in a pasture for fifteen years, and a new farm for him and Maria. In the great tradition of heroes&#x2014;from Don Quixote to Shrek&#x2014;who faced the world in the company of their donkeys, Jon came to understand compassion and mercy in a new light, learning to open up &#x201c;not just to Simon, not just to animals, but to the human experience. To love, to risk, to friendship.&#x201d;<br><br> With grace, warmth, and keen emotional insight, <i>Saving Simon</i> plumbs the depths of the bonds we form with our animals, and the rewards of &#x201c;living a more compassionate, considered, and meaningful life.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Saving Simon</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Heartwarming . . . a touching tale.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>USA Today</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Highly recommended . . . an enjoyable and thoughtful work.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;Library Journal</i> (starred review)</b><br><br> &#x201c;[<i>Saving Simon</i>] handles the emotional highs and lows of living with animals with empathy and thoughtfulness, forcing readers to re-examine their own meanings of compassion and mercy.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;The message of this true story will linger with the reader long after the book has been placed on the shelf.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Bookreporter</i></b></p><p><b>Jon Katz</b> has written twenty-six books, including works of nonfiction, novels, short stories, and books for children; he is also a photographer.

I live there with my wife, Maria, and numerous animals. My life has never proceeded in straight lines; zigs and zags are more my style. If my life on a farm is characterized by any one idea, it would be this: one thing leads to another.<br><br>And it was Carol that led, in zigs and zags, to Simon.<br><br>I believe the first donkey I ever laid eyes on was wearing a straw hat and hee-�hawing at Elmer Fudd in a Saturday morning cartoon. I remember the donkey had enormous teeth and was rather loud and goofy.<br><br>I never saw a real donkey until I was nearly fifty years old. I had taken my border collie out to a sheep farm in Pennsylvania to learn how to herd sheep. The experience transformed me in many ways. I decided to buy my own farm, I began writing about dogs, and I encountered a donkey who was to alter the nature of my life.<br><br>Carol was nearly twenty years old when I met her. She was living in a small corral. Like many donkeys, Carol seemed an afterthought, a misfit. Donkeys come to farms for all kinds of reasons. Somebody might trade a donkey for an old horse or for some hay. A farmer might come across one and take pity on it, or suspect it might be useful down the road.<br><br>Sometimes donkeys luck out and end up on rich horse farms, keeping horses company, getting to eat the good hay and grain, and are even quartered indoors in heated stalls. But that is not the fate of most donkeys. Donkeys have lived with humans as long as or longer than dogs have, but donkeys haven&#x2019;t figured out how to worm their way into human hearts quite so well. Their history and general treatment do not speak well of the generosity and mercy of human beings.<br><br>The farmer couldn&#x2019;t even quite remember how Carol had ended up with him but she had been in that corral every day for the sixteen years that he had owned her. Once in a while he tossed some hay over the fence and filled up the rusty bathtub with fresh water, but mostly, Carol survived off of brush and bark, pooled rain water, and water from a small muddy stream that ran through her corral. Twice a year, a farrier came to trim her hooves.<br><br>The farmer was busy, and he conceded that most of the time, he forgot about Carol. Farm animals are not pets; they are pretty hardy. Donkeys are especially hardy, and can go far on very little.<br><br>The thought of Carol alone for years in that tiny patch of woods haunted me, offering some of the first stirrings of an emotional notion of compassion, but even then, my response to her was to bring some apples whenever I visited the farm; it didn&#x2019;t go much deeper than that. I was distracted, busy, I had a kid, other worries; the life of a donkey seemed very remote to me.<br><br>Carol was not good-�natured or accepting, and she did not wish to have her hooves trimmed. After a while, the battered farrier just gave her a drugged apple before going to work. She still managed to bite and kick him at least once every time. The farmer told me this by way of cautioning me to be careful around her. &#x201c;She has sweet eyes,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but she is not sweet.&#x201d; Maybe, I thought, that was why he had left her alone in that corral all these years.<br><br>Carol&#x2019;s corral was right next to the big pasture where I was learning to herd sheep with my dog, and I would see her staring at me. It unnerved me. She seemed to be trying to tell me something, but since I had never come near a real donkey in my life, I had no idea what it was she might be saying.<br><br>I felt bad for her, in the way middle-�class people who grew up in cities feel bad for animals who live their natural lives out in the real world. We just can&#x2019;t help but project feelings into their heads. I just assumed she was hungry, and she seemed quite lonely all by herself in that corral, staring at me.<br><br>The first time I brought her apples, I walked over to the corral, my pockets stuffed with some big, red, juicy ones. Carol leaned over the fence, grabbed the first apple&#x2014;�and nearly my thumb with it&#x2014;�and crunched it judiciously and hungrily. My dog was standing back, staring at Carol, trying to keep an eye on the sheep who were grazing nearby.<br><br>I reached for another apple, but Carol was not willing to be patient. She walked right through the fence, dragging wire and fence posts behind her, put her ears down, and charged my terrified dog, who took off toward the other side of the pasture. The sheep needed no invitation to leave, and they took off in the other direction. Carol then turned to me, ripped the apple out of my pocket, and began nosing my other pockets for more.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, hey,&#x201d; I said, not sure what commands to give a donkey. I was shocked to realize she could have walked through the fence any day of those sixteen years she had spent there had she chosen to. It was my first real demonstration of donkey thinking. The first rule of the donkey ethos: everything is their idea.<br><br>It took a while for the irritated farmer to get Carol back inside&#x2014;�a loaf of bread did it&#x2014;�and he warned me in no uncertain terms to leave her alone.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t do that, of course. Every time I came herding, I brought apples and carrots. I would climb into her corral with the treats so she would have no reason to bust out.<br><br>There are some people who are deeply drawn into the rescue of animals. I am not one. I think in some ways animal rescue is too intense for me, too difficult. Perhaps that&#x2019;s one reason I love happy, healthy, well-�bred working dogs. I love to do things with them; I love the way they enter my life easily and come along with me.<br><br>But I fell in love with Carol, this grumpy, independent creature. I worried about her. I wanted to help her. It did something for me&#x2014;�something selfish&#x2014;�to treat her well. It fed something inside of me.<br><br>In her own way, she was quite affectionate with me. She loved it when I rubbed the inside of her ears or tickled the sides of her nose. She would not let me brush her, and if I didn&#x2019;t have an apple, she would lower her head and butt me in the side or rear end. Carol made no pretense about our relationship&#x2014;�she wanted the apples, and if she felt like it, she might allow me to show her some affection. Or not. Donkeys cannot be bought or bribed, only appeased.<br><br>And Carol . . . well, she was not very nice. She wouldn&#x2019;t have fit into one of those cute donkey tales in cartoons and movies. Sometimes you had to like the idea of her more than Carol herself. This was perhaps the first inkling I had about the vagaries of compassion&#x2014;�we tend to feel it for people and animals we like; it is hard to feel it for people and animals we don&#x2019;t like.<br><br>Whenever I was out herding, Carol would come over to the fence and hang her head on the outside, her ears turning like radar scanners, eyeing me soulfully with her big brown eyes. Somehow, it seemed as if I were her human, and she was my donkey, even though my home at the time was in suburban New Jersey, where donkeys played no part in the life of anyone.<br><br>A year or so after I met Carol, I bought a farm in upstate New York&#x2014;�I called it Bedlam Farm&#x2014;�and I bought some of the sheep I had been working with. The farmer hired somebody with a trailer to drive them up to me. If I had never met a donkey before Carol, I also had never set foot on a farm before in my life&#x2014;�I was raised in Providence, Rhode Island, and had lived in New York City, Dallas, Boston, Washington, and Baltimore before moving to New Jersey. The farm would, in my mind, become a laboratory for my newfound passion to write about dogs, animals, and rural life. Bedlam Farm consisted of ninety acres, a Civil War&#x2013;�era farmhouse, four barns, and large areas of fenced-�in pasture. It was a good place for sheep and a paradise for donkeys, although I had no plans to acquire any. I had heard from farmers that donkeys were wonderful guard animals, and would keep coyotes and predators away from sheep. But I had my hands full just trying to survive on my new farm. When the trailer of sheep arrived, the driver backed it into the pasture and opened the gates.<br><br>The first creature out was Carol, who looked around disdainfully, snorted, kicked one of the sheep away from her, and put her nose in my pocket. The driver handed me a note from the farmer, which read, &#x201c;Here is Carol. You love her so much, you can feed her.&#x201d;<br><br>So began my life with Carol. She was, from the first, the most imperious creature I had ever met, human or animal. In hot summers, she loved to hang out in the big shady barn. She could hardly believe her good fortune having acres of pasture to wander and all the grass and fresh water she might want.<br><br>Carol was an older donkey, and she had lived outdoors for years without shelter or good, nutritious food. I saw her limping, and had a large-�animal vet come and check her out. Carol did not wish to be examined. She butted the vet into the wall, tried to bite him, and nearly kicked him through the window. We got a halter on her and cross-�tied her to the sides of the barn. She had a laundry list of ailments, from foundering&#x2014;�a painful wasting disease of the hooves&#x2014;�to swollen joints and gums. She was, the vet said, in great pain, and he gave her some shots and handed me a bunch of long needles to stick in her butt later in the day. Then he left.<br><br>That night, when I went out to administer the medications, I got another major lesson in donkey thinking. They read intentions. When I came out to give Carol an apple, she was standing by the gate, meek as a kitten. If I came out with some needles or medicines in my pocket, she was off and running. That night it was &#x2212;20�F, and a stubborn human and a stubborn donkey had an epic confrontation on my farm&#x2019;s hilly pasture. Carol took off in a blinding storm, hobbling and stumbling up a hill, as my border collie Rose and I gave chase. I caught her an hour later on the top of the hill and stuck the needle in her butt while she dragged me all the way back down the hill. I got frostbite in three fingers that night. I learned that if you want to give a donkey a needle, get her in a small stall with a grain bucket, hide the needle out of sight, and then stick her when her mouth is full.<br><br>Despite all her ailments, she kept giving me donkey lessons.</p><h2>Peck, Peck, Peck</h2><p><b>Comical and original, this vivacious picture book from the creator of Maisy features a lovable new character &#x2014; and a novelty element that&#x2019;s a hole lot of fun.</b><br><br><i>Today my daddy said to me,<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time you learned to peck a tree.&#x201d;</i><br><br>Little woodpecker has just learned to peck.

The author covers the key major points in grantwriting. I truly wish I had had the advantage of such a comprehensive guide earlier in my career, but I find it useful even now. It is really more important today because the ration of grantwriting success has become much more stringent than it has been in years past, and may become more stringent still. This higher 'failure' rate means that the ROI on each submission has declined, which in turn means more grants need to be submitted, which means that the cost of lost opportunities in other work is higher. This book will surely increase the success potential of your proposals." <br> <br>-- <em>John Tropman, PhD, MA, Henry J.

If we are going to prepare young people to be successful in this reality, we ourselves have to learn and practice the skills for acting adaptively and for creating schools, human systems as they are, that can survive and thrive under these conditions. This revised edition is a powerful but not hostile counterweight to the push toward measurement and short-term accountability that threatens to suck the life out of individuals, organizations, communities and, yes, schools where inspiring lifelong learning and capacities for adaptation has to be the most important goal.

Mauled in street battles with the Chicago police during the Days of Rage demonstrations, Weather concluded that traditional political protest was insufficient to end the war. They turned instead to underground guerrilla combat.<br><br>In this highly readable history, Ron Jacobs captures the hair-raising drama of a campaign which planted bombs in banks, military installations and, twice on successive days, in the US Capitol. He describes the group&#x2019;s formation of clandestine revolutionary cells, its leaders&#x2019; disavowal of monogamous relationships, and their use of LSD to strengthen bonds between members. He recounts the operational failures of the group&#x2014;three members died when a bomb they were building exploded in Greenwich Village&#x2014;as well as its victories including a successful jailbreak of Timothy Leary. Never short-changing the fierce debates which underpinned the Weather&#x2019;s strategy, Jacobs argues that the groups eventual demise resulted as much from the contradictions of its politics as from the increasingly repressive FBI attention.</p><p>The Weather Underground was a small band of no more than a few hundred radicals, yet the fringe group was widely feared and revered as notorious bombers and violent revolutionaries. In <i>The Way the Wind Blew</i> Ron Jacobs presents a history of the group, from its origins on college campuses to the surrender of its last fugitive members in the 1980s. Along the way they set off bombs (...) and issued communiqu�s that were largely irrelevant if not incomprehensible to the American public. The dispassionate tone of this book allows for a credible narrative history of the group and its most prominent members, but many questions about the group's motivations remain unanswered.Raised as a military brat, <b>Ron Jacobs</b> spent many of his child and teen years in US outposts abroad, from Pakistan to Germany.

To find the answers, Kenan traveled America--from Alaska to Louisiana, from Maine to Las Vegas--over the course of six years, interviewing nearly two hundred African Americans from every conceivable walk of life. We meet a Republican congressman and an AIDS activist; a Baptist minister in Mormon Utah and an ambitious public-relations major in North Dakota; militant activists in Atlanta and movie folks in Los Angeles. The result is a marvellously sharp, full picture of contemporary African American lives and experiences.</p><p>This delicious and diverse sampler of African American life culled from over 200 interviews by author Randall Kenan shows that the American idea of "blackness" is as vast as the United States itself and cannot be pinned down to simplistic sociological clich�s. "More than a book of analysis," Kenan writes, "this is my book of soul searching. I am asking who we are." Crisscrossing North America, he visits some familiar settings--Oakland, New Orleans, and New York--and some unusual places (including Bangor, Maine, and Maidstone, Saskatchewan) to discover how everyday black folks deal with issues of race, identity, and nationality. From a black minister in Mormon Utah to a female judge in skinhead country to the state of blacks in the would-be utopia of Seattle, Kenan paints a revealing portrait of a people whose presence and perseverance may forge a better America in the 21st century. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i>"In his refusal to claim any special insight into the private dimensions of negritude, with his willingness to grant all of us our human complexities, and through his generosity of spirit that is accepting and understanding of our common frailties, Randall Kenan has fashioned a book that puts aside the "blacker than thou" sectarian arguments of yesterday and studies African-Americans as they live at the end of the century in vagriegated social, economic and political situations. In lonely New England or on Chicago's teeming South Side, he takes the temperature of 'the race,' and tells the complicated truth as he finds it, good news or bad. I salute his compassion and honesty, and am grateful for his ambition, the reach of it and the grasp." <br>--Anthony Walton<p>"Here is the best of the documentary tradition--its narrative possibilities realized wonderfully, suggestively by a talented wrtier of fiction who uses his storytelling skills to present a range of Americans to the rest of us, their fellow citizens."<br>--Robert Coles</p><p>"Somehow Randall Kenan has managed the impossible: weaving ethnography and poetry into a wonderful narrative about what it means to be black at the end of the century. Walking on Water astutely comprehends the complexity and beautiful contrdictions in the contour of black life. Reading Walking on Water is an extraordinary sojourn."<br> --Manning Marable, Professor of History, Director, Institute for Research in African-American Studies, Columbia University</p><p>"[This book] pulsates with the multilayered rhythms of an epic . . . A lush tapestry of place, people, and personal reflection that is much more than the sum of its parts . . . Kenan's masterwork is a panoramic document of African-American life at the end of the 20th century. It is also a labor of love and a majestic offering to the future."<br>--Salim Muwakkil, <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p><br>"A work of insight and compassion . . .

This book seeks to account for the imperial phenomenon and to establish its importance as a subject in the study of the theory of world politics.</p><p>Michael Doyle believes that empires can best be defined as relationships of effective political control imposed by some political societies&#x2015;those called metropoles&#x2015;on other political societies&#x2015;called peripheries. To build an explanation of the birth, life, and death of empires, he starts with an overview and critique of the leading theories of imperialism. Supplementing theoretical analysis with historical description, he considers episodes from the life cycles of empires from the classical and modern world, concentrating on the nineteenth-century scramble for Africa. He describes in detail the slow entanglement of the peripheral societies on the Nile and the Niger with metropolitan power, the survival of independent Ethiopia, Bismarck's manipulation of imperial diplomacy for European ends, the race for imperial possession in the 1880s, and the rapid setting of the imperial sun. </p><p>Combining a sensitivity to historical detail with a judicious search for general patterns, <i>Empires</i> will engage the attention of social scientists in many disciplines.</p></p><p><p>Michael W. Doyle is Assistant Professor of Political Science at The Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>"Ranging from the Athenian empire to the nineteenth century, Michael W. Doyle attempts to construct a historical sociology of empires that will encompass imperialism's infinite variety.... He recognizes the diversity of empires and imperial motivation, the French 'civilizing mission,' Spanish Catholicism and, implicitly, British 'muscular Christianity.'... The overall argument... has a persuasive simplicity and symmetry.... <i>Empires</i> is an excellent introduction to current theories of imperialism, and an interesting attempt at a new synthesis."</p> (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br><p>"The analysis of the causes and patterns of imperialism has long been a difficult academic exercise.... To structure this far-ranging phenomenon and arrange its course in a concise, interpretive essay takes pluck, if a good adjective from the derring-do novels of empire may be used here. Michael W. Doyle had that pluck and has succeeded remarkably well in his task. This is a splendid essay, an effective combination of broad historical analysis and well-presented theoretical assessments derived from the social sciences. The book will no doubt stand as one of the best contemporary syntheses of the progress of imperialism.... Doyle has read widely and well. He has mastered his material and has done with it something masterly: he has made the whole more than the sum of the parts. What follows next from the lively mind of this scholar will be pleasantly anticipated."</p> (<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br><p>"As a contribution to multicausal analysis of social change, this is a major work.

And for God's&nbsp;sake <i>why</i>?<br><br>These are the thorny questions that Lewis Black, the bitingly funny comedian, social critic, and bestselling author, tackles in his new book, <i>Me of Little Faith</i>. And he's come up with some answers. Or at least <i>his </i>answers. In more than two dozen essays that investigate everything from the differences between how Christians and Jews celebrate their holidays, to the politics of faith, to people's individual search for transcendence, Black explores his unique odyssey through religion and belief.<br><br>Growing up as a nonpracticing Jewish kid near Washington, D.C., during the 1950s, Black survived Hebrew school and&nbsp;a bar mitzvah (barely), went to college in the South during the tumultuous 1960s, and witnessed firsthand the unsettling parallels between religious rapture and drug-induced visions (even if none of his friends did). He explored the self-actualization movements of the 1970s (and the self-indulgence that they produced), and since then has turned&nbsp;an increasingly skeptical eye toward the politicians and televangelists who don&nbsp;the cloak of religiouos rectitude to mask their own moral hypocrisy.<br><br>What he learned along the way about the inconsistencies and peculiarities of religion infuriated Black, and in <i>Me of Little Faith </i>he gives full vent to his comedic rage. Black explores how the rules and constraints of religion have affected his life and the lives of us all. Hilarious experiences with rabbis, Mormons, gurus, psychics, and even the joy of a perfect round of golf give Black the chance to expound upon what we believe and why&#x2014;in the language of a shock jock and with the heart of an iconoclast.<br><br>"To put it as simply as I can," Black writes, "this is a book about my relationship with religion, where my&#x2014;dare I say it?&#x2014;spiritual journey has taken me...what it's meant and not meant to me, and why it makes me laugh."

He's won a Grammy, an Emmy, and an American Comedy Award. Born near Washington, D.C., Black graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and has a master's degree from the Yale School of Drama.Black, a well-known writer and comedian, examines religion in the acerbic, irascible manner of his stand-up shows, starting with Judaism, the faith he was born into. He tends to reject organized religion but not spirituality. There&#39;s real feeling and thought in his cynicism and salty rants, but he&#39;s still, at times, laugh-until-you-cry funny. His delivery is important, if not crucial, to that effect--reading this book in print would not be the same. At the end of the program, he performs--with cowriter Mark Linn-Baker--a short play from 1981, which treats comedy as a religion. It&#39;s so amateurishly awkward and unfunny that it almost spoils the experience of the book. But that aside, there&#39;s both substance and strong humor here.

When it attaches itself to the goats the goats become very unhappy and even stop giving milk. There is nothing gappers like more than goats and nothing goats hate more than gappers. When gappers get your goats it means trouble. In one small town gappers are a real pest and it takes the ingenious approach of Capable to find a soution - if a solution exists at all.</p><p><i>The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip</i> is that rarity, a fable that appeals equally to literate adults and id-crazed kids. Its author, George Saunders, is a Thomas Pynchon-approved, three-time O.&nbsp;Henry Award-winning surrealist writer; its artist, Lane Smith, is the Caldecott-honored illustrator of <i>The Stinky Cheese Man</i> and film designer of <i>James and the Giant Peach</i>. Nothing could evoke Saunders's simple yet extravagant story better than Smith's strange, painterly depictions of the seaside town of Frip, a place of ornery eccentrics and oddball animals. Smith combines some of the virtues of George Grosz, Dr. Seuss, and the Japanese prints called Ukiyo-e ("pictures of the floating world"). <p> Gappers are baseball-sized, burr-shaped orange creatures with a compulsion to creep up out of the sea and fasten themselves to goats, whom they love. "When a gapper gets near a goat it gives off a continual high-pitched happy shriek of pleasure that makes it impossible for the goat to sleep, and the goats get skinny and stop giving milk," writes Saunders. Since Frip survives by selling goat milk, the children must brush gappers off the herd eight times daily and dump them into the ocean. You simply must see Smith's picture of Capable, the book's plucky heroine, emptying her gapper-sack from a precarious cliff picturesquely menaced by subtly colored waves. You'll be torn between lingering over the gorgeous artwork and flipping the page to see how Capable will ever cope with the gapper invasion of Frip, her obdurately past-obsessed widower papa, and her dumb, mean neighbors (two snooty, boy-obsessed girls and a family of singers who are harder on the ears than a keening gapper attached to the goat of its dreams). This is a slim tale, but unquestionably one quite in keeping with Saunders's prizewinning books. The title story of <i>Pastoralia</i>, for instance, is also a fable involving class struggle and people who get snooty about the difficulties of working with goats. </p><p> <i>The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip</i> is a grownups' book, a kids' book, an art book, and a cause for countless happy shrieks of pleasure. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>get your goat. Literally. If you don't brush them off and return them to the ocean, whence they arrive every day, these bright orange, many-eyed creatures will cover your goats, and the goats will stop giving milk.<br><br>In a village called Frip, goat's milk was the entire economy. Three families lived there--the Romos, the Ronsens, and a little girl named Capable and her widowed father, who wanted everything to remain the same. It didn't. One day, the Gappers, despite an average IQ of 3.7 (�.02), decided for a good reason to concentrate on Capable's goats. Oh, how the Romos and Ronsens turned their backs on the gapper-ridden Capable! Oh, how they indeed lorded it over her!

You won't believe how easy it is to look and feel your best!</p><p>Years ago, Suzanne Somers lost the chance to appear on a hit television series because she was "too chunky." That missed opportunity started her on a "diet roller coaster," trying all kinds of diets. Now Somers believes that diets and deprivation do not help people lose weight in the long-term. In <i>Eat Great, Lose Weight</i>, she explains the food-combining plan she calls "Somersizing": eliminate "funky foods" such as sugar ("my body's greatest enemy") and white flour; eat fruits alone on an empty stomach; eat proteins and fats with vegetables and without carbohydrates; eat carbohydrates with vegetables and without fat.<p> Sommers presents 113 recipes that certainly don't resemble a traditional diet and might make a weight-loss expert's hair curl, such as Crispy Fried Eggplant and Mozzarella Finger Sandwiches, Flourless Cheese Souffle (with butter, eggs, cream cheese, and Gruy�re cheese), and Grilled Pepper Steak with Herb Butter (trim the fat from the meat, but add both butter and olive oil). There's no nutritional breakdown, so you can't count fat or calories. Somers admits that "many experts will argue that food combining is a myth," but she says it works for her, and she credits it with trimming her down to 116 pounds, even though she eats "more than ever."</p>&#34;I have finally found a way to control my weight without deprivation.

In lyrical prose and singular dialect, a saga beats forward that echoes the fables carried down for generations&#x2015;like the screecher birds who swoop down for their periodic sacrifice, and the water women who lure men to wet deaths.</p><p>Among its residents&#x2015;wildly spanning decades, perspectives, and species&#x2015;are David Sherman, a struggling musician who just happens to be God&#x2019;s last son; Tyrone, a ruthless PhD candidate, whose dissertation about a childhood game ignites mayhem in the neighboring, once-segregated town of Port Yooga; and Jim, an all-too-obedient robot who serves his Master. As the book builds to its finish with Special Topics in Loneliness Studies, a fully-realized novella, two unhinged professors grapple with hugely different ambitions, and the reader comes to appreciate the intricacy of the world Scott has created&#x2015;one where fantasy and reality are eternally at war.</p><p>Contemporary and essential, <em>The World Doesn&#x2019;t Require You</em> is a &#x201c;leap into a blazing new level of brilliance&#x201d; (Lauren Groff) that affirms Rion Amilcar Scott as a writer whose storytelling gifts the world very much requires.</p> 28 black-and-white illustrations</p><p><strong>Rion Amilcar Scott</strong>'s first book, <em>Insurrections</em>, won the PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize for Debut Fiction. His work has been published in the <em>Kenyon Review</em>, the <em>Rumpus</em>, <em>PANK</em>, and <em>Confrontation</em>, among others. He lives and writes in Maryland.&#x201c;Scott&#x2019;s Cross River has been compared to other authors&#x2019; imagined places, from Faulkner&#x2019;s Yoknapatawpha County to Jesmyn Ward&#x2019;s Bois Sauvage (and I would add Nisi Shawl&#x2019;s Everfair, as well as Black Panther&#x2019;s Wakanda), but it&#x2019;s completely his own, forged of deep roots, racial conflict and humor so mordant you&#x2019;ll do double takes.... These stories range from satire (&#x201c;The Electric Joy of Service&#x201d;) to fantasy (&#x201c;Numbers&#x201d;) to horror (&#x201c;Rolling in My Six-Fo&#x2019;?&#x201d;) and not one of them strikes a false note. There are angry notes. Even, perhaps, hostile ones. But none that are unwarranted. A few readers may be shocked by Scott&#x2019;s use of cultural epithets, but those are far from unnecessary. We have so far to go and so little time to get there, Scott seems to say. Maybe spending a few hours in Cross River will help build a bridge. Or blow one up, if need be.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bethanne Patrick, <i>Washington Post</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A rich, genre-splicing mix of alternate history, magical realism and satire that interrogates issues of race, sexism and where both meet here in the real world.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Chris Barton, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Rion Amilcar Scott proves himself an impressive myth-slayer and fable-maker... <em>The World Doesn&#x2019;t Require You</em> reminds us that having to fight racism has a strange way of distorting everything one touches....

We also know this because God was resurrected there, which we learn from his progeny in &#x2018;David Sherman, the Last Son of God,&#x2019; and because in another futuristic story, slave history is reenacted by cyborgs. Scott joins a growing tradition of African-American authors fusing the folksy dystopian humor of George Saunders with the charged satire of Ishmael Reed and expands on it brilliantly.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Boris Kachka, <i>New York Magazine</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A bold new talent emerges with this boundary-shattering collection of linked stories set in fictional Cross County, Maryland, founded by the leaders of America&#x2019;s only successful slave uprising. Characters range from robots to sons of God in these magical realist stories about race, religion, and violence. Think of it as Faulkner meets Asimov.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Adrienne Westenfeld, <i>Esquire</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A bleak and beautiful collection of short stories.... Scott demonstrates the skill and long-range vision of a writer we need right now. <em>The World Doesn&#x2019;t Require You</em> requires a commitment from readers, one that will be greatly repaid in literary satisfaction.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Emily Gray Tedrowe, <i>USA TODAY</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Powerful and revelatory.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Erin Keane, <i>Salon</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Scott&#x2019;s interweaving story collection covers generations and defies genre restrictions in a series of wry, magically tinged character studies. The book affirms Scott, who won awards for his first collection Insurrection, as a major unique literary talent.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Entertainment Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Scott makes his stories feel singular.... [The] high level of energy and humor, which Scott maintains throughout, makes the novella a standout.... He bends expectations throughout the book, frequently demonstrating this idea from the aforementioned public speaker: &#x2018;Everything horrible is just a little bit ridiculous, and vice versa.&#x2019; And despite how clear Scott is about this modus operandi, he constantly surprises, pushing things just a little further in either direction.... Though God may have forsaken [these characters], Scott does not. <em>The World Doesn&#x2019;t Require You</em> is full of horrible, ridiculous people, but it&#x2019;s full of grace, too.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bradley Babendir, A.V.

In a battle that included the future US president William Henry Harrison, American naval hero Oliver Hazard Perry, and the legendary Shawnee leader Tecumseh, the Americans prevailed, due in part to their imaginative use of Kentucky mounted riflemen to charge British regular infantry and artillery.

Carpet-making is one of this tumultuous region's few constants, an art form that transcends religious and political turmoil. Part travelogue and part exploration into the meaning and worth of these mystical artifacts, <i>The Root of Wild Madder</i> presents practical information about carpets while exploring the artistic, religious, and cultural complexities of these enigmatic lands.</p><p><b>Brian Murphy</b> is the author of <i>The New Men: Inside the Vatican's Elite School for American Priests.</i> A foreign correspondent for the Associated Press since 1993, and the AP's international religion writer since 2004, he lives in Athens, Greece.<blockquote><i>Oh, you painters who ask for a technique of color -- study carpets and there you will find all knowledge.</i><p><i> -- Paul Gauguin</i></p></blockquote><p><b>A Prologue: Madder and Bone</b></p><p>I came a long way to stand in a field of wild madder.</p><p>My driver stopped. I stepped off the one-lane road that pierced the dust bowl of central Iran. Then I walked down a path. It slithered atop a narrow ridge.</p><p>I liked that. It gives an idea of how I ended up here: definitely not a straight line and always struggling to keep some balance.</p><p>I had set out to write about carpets and the people who make them, sell them, cherish them, and, above all, see them with the same wonder that I do. At first, as a journalist, I poked around the edges of their lives on frequent assignments to Iran and Afghanistan, two important landmarks on the vast carpet map. But when I started to look more closely, I confronted the dilemma of any cartographer: what features to enhance and what details to omit. In other words, how do you find the right scale and relevance amid unlimited possibilities?</p><p>This is my attempt.</p><p>The things that intrigued me -- handwoven carpets, the art of making dyes from nature and the expressions of beauty and faith they produce -- already had an old and rich topography. There were imperial kings and swordsmen, folktales and cauldrons of steaming colors, lumbering caravans and cunning merchants. And -- perhaps most delightful of all -- mystic poets whose images dance in purple shadow and amber light. It could be rewarding enough just to explore the ground that others had covered and look for scraps and stories they had missed. But there was more out there if I searched harder. I had it on good authority.</p><p>A leafy little plant called madder told me so. I had been reading about its rich history as a dyestuff for carpets. Then I came across a quirky reference that is all but forgotten.</p><p>It can turn our bones red.</p><p>I first spotted this in a medical paper on skeletal development. It's now just an obscure footnote from nearly three centuries ago. But at the time -- as the Enlightenment was driving away medieval phantoms -- it caused a sensation and upended prevailing ideas about physiology. To me, this bit of historical flotsam was still impressive.</p><p>I decided madder would serve as my polestar. It would help me negotiate the noisy bazaars, musty workshops, distant villages, and other places I couldn't even yet imagine.</p><p>Madder seemed an ideal beacon to keep me on course. I could drift off on any detour in the carpet world and never really lose sight of madder's influence and the fiery palette held in its roots.</p><p>The bone story stayed my favorite. But I'd learn there were many others.</p><p>They flow generously from sources both illustrious and arcane. Madder's diary goes back as far as history's earliest written pages. And it most likely tumbles even further into the past.</p><p>The madder root -- dried and ground into dyers' powder -- was carried by Phoenician traders and mentioned in Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Greek historian-wanderer Herodotus noted that it produced the striking vermilion shades on the goatskin cloaks of Libya's most elegant women. The Bible refers to madder as <i>pu'ah,</i> which some scholars believe was also a lullaby sound used to calm crying infants. To the Romans, it was <i>rubia,</i> which has endured as its scientific name. Pliny the Elder believed the most bountiful madder flourished in gardens near Rome.</p><p>Genus <i>Rubia,</i> family <i>Rubiaceae,</i> order <i>Rubiales.</i> The linguistic lineage fans out in many directions: ruby, rubric, rubella.</p><p>Alchemists pored over its properties in hopes of coaxing magic from nature. Artists made their canvases glow with madder-based glazes. As the Dutch master Jan Vermeer was finishing his famous <i>Girl with a Red Hat</i> in 1666, colonies were taking root across the Atlantic that would rebel a century later against the British crown. The soldiers of King George III sent to fight the American patriots wore madder-dyed red coats.</p><p>Healers, too, were drawn to the madder root's tentacles, which are full of swollen joints and crooked angles like those of an arthritic patient. The colors it bestowed must have seemed too powerful, too close to our own blood, to be medically benign. Extracts were prescribed -- with little recorded success -- for complaints ranging from jaundice to irregular menstruation to chronic bruising.</p><p>Then in about 1735 a British surgeon named John Belchier chronicled a remarkable observation. Animals fed madder leaves had red-tinged bones. And not everywhere. Only in the places where bones were growing and developing.</p><p>Belchier's research won him the prestigious Copley Medal and sharply redirected studies in anatomy. A prominent and ambitious London physiologist, John Hunter, led the pack toward the new frontiers in medicine. He extensively explored the use of madder in bone studies during a long career that included some unconventional offshoots. Hunter, according to some accounts, maintained dark alliances with grave robbers in order to get research cadavers. The stories claim he paid a substantial bribe in 1783 to obtain the body of the "Irish giant," Charles Byrne, who was more than eight feet tall and made a sad and meager living as a carnival freak. Byrne, shortly before his death, apparently caught wind of Hunter's plans. He reportedly tried to avoid Hunter's dissection table by requesting burial at sea inside a lead-lined coffin. But Hunter's resources and network were too strong. Byrne's skeleton remains in the collection of The Royal College of Surgeons of England along with other forensic oddities and relics of Hunter's age, such as a pig's skull stained a pinkish red from its madder diet.</p><p>Most may consider it all just an eccentric bit of pre-Victorian science. But I felt that Belchier's interplay of bone and madder was crying out for more attention. It seemed to me a rare convergence of the physical and mystical, a union, I believe, that also graces carpets. Madder -- coveted and used for millennia -- has this power to penetrate us so deeply and leave its mark so unmistakably. Carpets can do that, too, for those open to the possibilities.</p><p>I was lucky. I chose well. Madder led me -- with confidence and eloquence -- through the important first stages of my carpet education. It always had something important to say, and it tugged me along with one interesting connection after another: from texts on the craft of natural dye making, to the essential reds, peaches, and oranges produced by madder, then to its many guises throughout history, and on to Belchier's bones.</p><p>And, inevitably, to the madder plants at my feet.</p><p>Each step left sharp and perfectly formed footprints in the dry flatlands. In the distance, a jumble of low-slung buildings hugged the narrow road leading to the town of Ardakan, which sits on the southern fringe of an emptiness known as Dasht-e-Kavir, the Great Salt Desert.</p><p>It was early fall. There had been no rain for months. It's considered the best time to harvest madder. The mature plant is pulled up easily then. The roots hang in a jumble like a toddler's first scribbling. There are relatively few areas of wild madder left. Most growers prefer the cultivated <i>Rubia tinctorum,</i> known as the dyers' madder, which yields more powerful, color-rich powder. Wild madder is now more of a novelty or vestige of the plant's heyday that ended more than a century ago.</p><p>But it was something I needed to see. Wild madder is possibly the source for the shades of the earliest carpets. Red -- with its connotations of birth and mortality and the mysteries and yearnings in between -- has remained a fundamental color for carpet weavers. I felt it appropriate to pay my respects.</p><p>When I moved, clouds of tiny grasshoppers breached over the plants, then disappeared in the flame-shaped leaves with tiny barbs that grabbed at my ankles. I crouched low to give the illusion of the emerald green field rising up to swallow me, replacing the panorama of tan plains and the steel gray foothills.</p><p>The guide who brought me here grinds the dried madder root into coarse, rust-shaded powder. It's used by the wool and silk dyers who, for various reasons, still resist the easier and cheaper synthetic colors. This timeless process is under considerable pressure. Traditional dye masters were in steady decline until some carpet houses and other preservationists started efforts to revitalize the craft in the 1980s. Their interventions may have rescued natural dye making from becoming the stuff of hobbyists and concocted quaintness like the butter churners at country fairs.</p><p>In Iran, as recently as 2000, no more than 10 percent of new carpet production had naturally dyed material. Four years later, it was up to about 25 percent, said Majid Montazer, head of the dye division at the state-run Persian Carpet Research Center in Tehran.</p><p>"I would like to say it's because of some intellectual or cultural reawakening," he told me. "But it seems to be more about economics. This is what the customer wants. People are starting to understand that the natural dyes are just more attractive."</p><p>Considering the steamroller that calls itself progress, it's remarkable that the natural dyeing techniques were still around to save. Chemical colors have been commercially available since the mid-nineteenth century, constantly improving and supplanting the dye makers' livelihood and knowledge. Reds from the madder root. Yellows from pomegranate rind. Blues from the indigo plant. Browns from walnuts.</p><p>Chemical dyes may make sense from the perspective of the bottom line. Carpet making is, after all, a business, and businesses seek profits. But some wince at this equation. For them, something venerable and virtuous is being sacrificed. It's worth fighting back.</p><p>I sense a touch of this in Ali Akbari, who led me to the madder field. It's not sadness, exactly. But it's close. Maybe this was the look seen aboard clipper ships or in telegraph offices as the walls of the future began to close in. Akbari, a massive, moonfaced man constantly leaking sweat, wants to express...</p></p><h2>Madman&#39;s Drum: A Novel in Woodcuts (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)</h2><p>"Ward is ranked among the finest American wood engravers of the 20th century." &#x2014; artoftheprint.com<br>One of the finest American wood engravers of the twentieth century and an outstanding artist of any era, Lynd Ward (1905-85) created a series of fantastic visual novels. The powerful imagery and psychological intensity of his wordless works have elicited comparisons to the writings of Hawthorne, Melville, and Poe, and they have exercised an enormous influence over latter-day graphic novelists.<br>Ward's tutelage included studying under the direction of German woodcut and engraving master Hans Alexander Mueller. He published his first book, <i>Gods' Man: A Novel in Woodcuts,</i> in 1929. Like its successors, including <i>Mad Man's Drum, Gods' Man </i>consists solely of Ward's woodcuts, telling its story through imagery alone.<br>Ward's hauntingly rendered works have been honored with such prestigious awards as the Library of Congress Award, the National Academy of Design Print Award, the <i>New York Times </i>Best Illustrated Award, the Caldecott Medal, and the Regina Award.</p><p></p><h2>The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism (Anamnesis)</h2><p>Continental philosophy has entered a new period of ferment. The long deconstructionist era was followed with a period dominated by Deleuze, which has in turn evolved into a new situation still difficult to define. However, one common thread running through the new brand of continental positions is a renewed attention to materialist and realist options in philosophy. Among the leaders of the established generation, this new focus takes numerous forms. It might be hard to find many shared positions in the writings of Badiou, DeLanda, Laruelle, Latour, Stengers, and &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek, but what is missing from their positions is an obsession with the critique of written texts. All of them elaborate a positive ontology, despite the incompatibility of their results. Meanwhile, the new generation of continental thinkers is pushing these trends still further, as seen in currents ranging from transcendental materialism to the London-based speculative realism movement to new revivals of Derrida. As indicated by the title The Speculative Turn, the new currents of continental philosophy depart from the text-centered hermeneutic models of the past and engage in daring speculations about the nature of reality itself. This anthology assembles authors, of several generations and numerous nationalities, who will be at the centre of debate in continental philosophy for decades to come.</p><p></p><h2>Neogenesis (21) (Liaden Universe�)</h2><p><b>THE NATIONALLY BEST-SELLING LIADEN UNIVERSE SERIES CONTINUES</b>.

In documenting the vitality of such seemingly unusual healing traditions as talking the fire out of burns, wart-curing, blood-stopping, herbal healing, and rootwork, the contributors to this volume demonstrate how the region&#x2019;s folk medical systems operate in tandem with scientific biomedicine.<br>The authors provide illuminating commentary on the major forms of naturopathic and magico-religious medicine practiced in the United States. Other essays explain the persistence of these traditions in our modern technological society and address the bases of folk medical concepts of illness and treatment and the efficacy of particular pratices. The collection suggests a model for collaborative research on traditional medicine that can be replicated in other parts of the country. An extensive bibliography reveals the scope and variety of research in the field.<p></p><p><i>Contributors.</i> Karen Baldwin, Richard Blaustein, Linda Camino, Edward M.

She offers a review of the art that is not merely informative, but liberating. Challenging mainstream hermeneutic strategies she empowers us to think critically and enter creatively into a life-transforming journey.</p><p>Radical Catholic feminist theologian Schussler Fiorenza offers an introduction to feminist biblical interpretation that is sure to annoy some readers, enlighten some others and challenge all of them. As an introduction, the book is presumably intended to present Schussler Fiorenza's brand of liberation theology to a new audience beyond the academic theological one the Harvard Divinity School professor already commands. Yet the book can be slow going for the interested general reader, with neologisms and hyphenated Latinate adjectives weighing down many sentences. And the book will disappoint those looking for fresh takes on particular passages or specific women, because text itself isn't nearly as important in Schussler Fiorenza's interpretation as "context," or the set of social and political relationships that produced a particular story or statement. After Schussler Fiorenza has deconstructed traditional biblical texts, she attempts to reorient the reader by presenting other biblical passages (drawn most heavily from the wisdom literature of the Hebrew Bible) that offer female imagery for the Divine. With a glossary and exercises, this book tries hard to open the door of biblical interpretation to non-specialists, but the threshold is high. As a believer, Schussler Fiorenza wants readers to limn quite a different Divinity than the generally received Christian God, an imaginative prospect that requires a good deal of work on the reader's part. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Runaways</h2><p><b>The spellbinding Orphans series concludes in this thrilling new novel from V.C. Andrews�...</b> <br> "All for one and one for all" was the girls' motto. In the grim foster home for orphans run by Louise and Gordon Tooey, at least Brooke, Crystal, Raven, and Butterfly had each other. Calling themselves "sisters," together they could forget the past and dream of a new chance...a real home. Then they discovered a secret even more haunting than Gordon's heavy boots pounding on the wooden floors. Their fragile hopes of a better life shattered, they escaped the only way they could. Soon they were runaways in a borrowed car, desperately wishing to wake up one morning in a place of sunshine and love. <br> Raven hoped to be a singer, Butterfly wanted to be a dancer, Crystal planned for college, and Brooke privately hoped to find her mother in California. On the open road the chains of sadness that had bound them seemed to melt away, and the kindness of strangers made a secure future seem almost real. But the highway was a dangerous place, and soon they were penniless and more vulnerable than ever. Alone under the wide western sky, they had only each other to ask if they should give up their dreams...or if they were really halfway to a haven of safety and happiness....</p><p>One of the most popular authors of all time, V.C.

Pamela was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen and, though I thought it was strange that she wanted me to call her Pamela instead of Mommy or even Mother, I did what she asked. Orphans learn at a very young age to do anything, well, almost anything, to please prospective parents.<br><br>Pamela had been a beauty queen and chose me because she thought I looked like a younger version of her. No one had ever told me I was beautiful before, or had the potential to grow up to be beautiful, so when Pamela and Peter chose me for that very reason I was completely surprised, but happy, and for the first time in my life I thought that maybe I was special. That I wasn't just a little girl no one wanted.<br><br>I soon realized, though, that Pamela didn't think I was special because of who I really was, but because of who she thought she could make me into. All the pretty clothes and fancy lessons that at first made me feel like a charmed princess, soon became suffocating to me. I wasn't allowed to excel at the sports I played so well or to even be myself. I was getting all mixed up inside -- I wanted to please Pamela, she <i>was</i> my new mother, but I also knew that pleasing her meant losing myself.<br><br>Peter tried to help, and explained to Pamela that I could do well in sports and be a beauty queen, but Pamela just got nastier and nastier. Finally, when it seemed that she just wouldn't ever listen to the dreams that were in my heart, I did the only thing I knew how to make her understand. I cut off my beautiful long hair -- the hair that she so loved to brush and wash, the hair that would help me win her precious beauty pageants.<br><br>Pamela went into such a rage when she saw me that she started to hyperventilate, gasping for breath, declaring she was on the verge of a heart attack. She said I would be an enormous embarrassment to her and was no good as a beauty pageant contestant, or even as a daughter. Peter didn't know how to deal with Pamela's fury and so he sent me back to the Child Protection Services like a defective toy. And, years later, I am still here at Hell House.<br><br>Butterfly's experiences must have been much worse than mine, since she can barely talk about them. We've learned a bit over the years, but mostly when she tries to speak about it, or something reminds her of that time, she goes into one of her trances. Her foster mother, Celine Delorice, was a woman in her early thirties who had once had a promising career as a ballet dancer. She married a well-to-do businessman, Sanford Delorice, who supported her attempts to become a prima ballerina. However, shortly after their marriage, Celine was in a serious car accident and had to spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair. She talked Sanford into adopting a foster child and Celine chose Butterfly because she was so dainty and supposedly had perfect feet. She believed Butterfly would become the dancer she had expected she would be, and she had her start training almost the same day they brought her home from the orphanage.<br><br>Butterfly was a good dancer, but not a great dancer. She didn't progress as quickly as Celine had hoped and began to freeze under the pressure and the possibility of failure. Celine Delorice actually suffered a nervous breakdown from it. At least, that's what Butterfly told us, and soon after Sanford returned her to the system, claiming his wife's handicap made it impossible for them to bring up a child properly. Crystal thought there had to be something more, but she never pressured Butterfly, who could turn to stone if you forced her to talk about her past.<br><br>Despite her reserved fa�ade, Raven wasn't all that different from the rest of us. She had lived with her real family, her mother's brother, for a while after her mother had been arrested for a drug related crime and put into rehabilitation. We didn't know the nitty-gritty details, but something happened and Raven was brought here. All she would tell us was her uncle and aunt were not fit parents, especially her uncle. She did tell me that whatever had happened at her uncle and aunt's home involved her cousin, Jennifer. I wanted Raven to trust me enough to explain what had happened, but it seemed like Raven had trouble trusting anyone, even Crystal, Butterfly and me.<br><br>Raven's situation was really a lot more complicated than ours because Raven had a natural blood parent out there, somewhere, and the state made it almost impossible to adopt a child if there was even the slightest possibility she or he could be returned to that parent.<br><br>Crystal was the only one who really had a good experience with foster parents. She didn't speak about them very much, but when she did talk about them, she described Thelma's obsession with her soap operas and Karl's obsession with being efficient and organized. She told us he was an accountant and saw life as a balance between assets and liabilities. He often lectured her about being sensible. She said her adoptive parents were pleasant enough people, but from the way she spoke of them, I think she believed they were both living in a fantasy world. When they were both killed in an automobile accident, none of the relatives wanted to take her in, which resulted in her being returned to the system.<br><br>So here we were, the four of us, the Orphanteers, so different from each other, and yet, drawn to each other, feeling safer in our own little group, each of us adding something that we all needed, each of us willing to risk pain and unhappiness to protect the other or the group. Just looking at us, no one would think we had anything special to hold us together.<br><br>I usually wore dungarees and a tee shirt or old sweat shirt. I had sneakers and one pair of dressy shoes, but I favored my clodhoppers, as Raven called them, with sweat socks. I always wore the pink ribbon my real mother had tied in my hair before I had been given over to foster care. Of course, it was quite faded by now. I just tied it on my wrist. I hardly ever wore lipstick or makeup and used a stick deodorant rather than a cologne, when I even cared. Raven always wore a skirt or a dress.<br><br>Crystal wore simple one-piece dresses, and kept her dark brown hair either in a bun or sometimes in a ponytail. She would wear lipstick rarely, much less any makeup. She could walk around with an ink stain on her chin all day because she rarely looked at herself in the mirror.<br><br>Butterfly had much of the clothing she had when she lived with the Delorices, dainty little dresses, multicolored sneakers, a nice pink leather jacket. It was as if her growth had been stunted by her unhappiness. She hadn't grown out of much. She kept her golden hair in curls and only wore lipstick when Raven helped her with makeup.<br><br>Despite our four individual personalities, we did have something special, something we knew the other girls coveted. Maybe it was just the "Joining." Maybe there was some spiritual tie. At least we had something to believe in: each other.<br><br>Despite the episode with Butterfly, we were dressed and on our way down to the dining room in plenty of time. The Lakewood House was physically a perfect dormitory for two dozen or so foster children. Very little had been changed since its resort days. There was still a large sitting or recreational room where there once were card tables used for board games, dominos, card games or a game none of us had ever heard of before, something called mah-jongg. Louise said it had been the most popular game the tourist women played. She showed us the pieces, all with Asian writing on them, but warned us never to touch them. She explained that she and Gordon were just waiting for the right time to sell them as valuable antiques.<br><br>Most of the house was antique, or just plain old. The stairway we took down to the dining room shook and squeaked. The pipes groaned like arthritic old people, windows froze in their grooves, even in the summer, and very often, electrical fixtures didn't work. Gordon hated doing any maintenance, and usually waited until it was absolutely necessary. He didn't replace a step that had cracked badly on the stairway, for instance, even though it was dangerous, until he knew someone was coming from the state to inspect the premises. If something broke in our rooms, or if there were plumbing problems, he blamed it on one of us and let it remain broken for as long as he could.<br><br>Early on we noticed Louise was almost as afraid of Gordon as we were. If she ever contradicted him in front of us, he would just glare at her, his face crimson, his eyes glowing like embers in a fireplace, his neck muscles straining so hard, the arteries and veins would pop out, and his two large hands tightened into mallets. He was unusually strong. When he felt like showing off, he would permit the children to watch him chop down a tree. He did it with an ax, never pausing from the beginning until the tree actually began to topple. Chunks would fly around him like pate yellow moths; the tree seemed like it was made of paper. These demonstrations of power were indelibly pressed into the minds of the children. Woe to those who were the target of Gordon's fury.<br><br>And yet, whenever there were guests or state officials at the house, Gordon metamorphosed into a soft, smiling, gentle giant of a man who could walk around with a seven-year-old on his shoulders, loving, caring, protective. To see someone with such obvious physical power behave so gently was heartwarming to the visitors. Once, he caught me staring with disgust at him while he was putting on one of these Academy Award performances. He glanced my way and then he turned back to me, fixing his gaze on me with such a cold, bone-chilling look, I had to walk away quickly, my chest vibrating with the hammerlike thumping of my heart. I avoided him for days after that and finally he seemed to forget about me.<br><br>None of the wards seemed of any real interest to him. He knew our names and he knew which children to use when he wanted to demonstrate his concern and care in front of state people, but he usually left the real parenting work to Louise. She was the true administrator of the Lakewood House; he was more like a work boss.<br><br>However, Gordon was always after her to keep some distance between herself and the wards. He would complain about it, out loud, right in front of us.<br><br>"You're getting too involved with that one, Louise. I warned you."<br><br>Afterward, she explained that she and Gordon had been specifically instructed not to get too close with or form any sort of bond with a foster child. The logic was we were here only temporarily and soon were going back to our real parents or off to new adoptive families, and no one wanted any of us to feel sad about leaving or resent our new homes. What a joke. Who would resent leaving this? For my part, I was happy Gordon kept some distance and happy he was always after her to do the same.<br><br>Sometimes, she looked at us as if we really all were her children. Childless, she regretted losing any one of us. A real mother couldn't be more possessive at times, but warm affection around here was like contraband. She had to look for Gordon first and be sure he wasn't around before she planted a kiss on a child's forehead or held someone close to her ample bosom.<br><br>Louise wasn't the only one who tried to make us feel like a family here. A sweet elderly lady who insisted we all call her Grandma Kelly prepared our meals each day and always had kind words or a smile for us. Grandma Kelly lived in the nearby village of Mountaindale and had actually worked for the Tooey family when the Lakewood House was still a tourist retreat. She was only about five feet three with a round face that always had scarlet tinted cheeks, especially when she worked over a hot stove. She had soft eyes as blue as blue jay feathers. Her hair was the color of pewter and even more curly than Butterfly's, but she always wore a cap when she was in the kitchen. She told us she hadn't been brought to America until she was nearly twelve. To this day she still had an Irish brogue. Crystal said she reminded her of a leprechaun.<br><br>"It would be great if Grandma Kelly really was a leprechaun and led us to treasure so we could get out of here," I said.<br><br>Of course, Crystal didn't believe in such fairy tales, but we all liked to think that there was a pot of gold out there for us.<br><br>We joked about what Grandma Kelly would have made for breakfast that morning as we walked down to the dining room and while we stood in line waiting for our meals Crystal told us she planned on spending the day at the library, using their computer.<br><br>Crystal's dream was to become a doctor, and she told us she'd been researching information on getting college scholarships. She claimed that anything we wanted to learn about could be found on the Internet.<br><br>"What about my future?" I asked.<br><br>"As I told you before, there are statistics about foster children. Every year about fifteen thousand graduate from foster care by turning eighteen with no permanent family, and forty percent of all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare."<br><br>"Thanks for the encouragement," I muttered. "Miss Good News."<br><br>"You could get married," Raven said. "That's what I'm going to do as soon as I find someone rich enough."<br><br>"Why should he marry you?" I asked.<br><br>"Because I'm the prettiest girl he'll know," she replied, turning her shoulder and fluttering those long, black eyelashes. "And I'm the next Selena who will make one hit song after another, that's why." Butterfly laughed and Raven hugged her. "Someone loves me," she said. "Butterfly will be a famous dancer too, Crystal, so put that into your stupid statistics."<br><br>"I hate to disappoint or discourage you, but it's pretty hard to make it in the entertainment industry," Crystal joked back. "And look what happened to Selena!"<br><br>Raven stuck out her tongue as she turned to take Butterfly's hand. "C'mon Butterfly, let's get our food and let Crystal be grumpy by herself. She just doesn't know how to believe. We can be anything, as long as we believe." Raven's words sounded brave, but I knew that they were mostly for Butterfly's benefit; she was still shaking from this morning's episode.<br><br>As we waited in line for our food we surveyed the dining room.<br><br>Along the walls were the old photographs of the Lakewood House's bygone days, group pictures of guests gathered at the lake or around the lawn chairs. In most of the pictures, the people were dressed formally, men in jackets and ties, women in ankle-length dresses with high collars and frilly sleeves, all with pale faces, and all looking years and years older than they really were. There were many photos of families because the Lakewood House catered to families.

Neither writer describes (or prescribes) community here, but they do provide a vision to guide our search. <br><br> <b>For both the uninitiated seeker and the veteran,</b> this book offers guidance &#x2013; and a disarming call to a renewed commitment and a deepened faith.</p><p><b>Everyone&#x2019;s talking about &#x201c;community&#x201d; these days.

In <i>Radical Virtuosity</i>, art historian Genevieve Hyacinthe offers a new view of Mendieta, connecting her innovative artwork to the art, cultural aesthetics and concerns, feminisms, and sociopolitical messages of the black Atlantic. </p><p>Mendieta left Cuba as a preteen, fleeing the Castro regime, and spent years in U.S. foster care. Her sense of exile, Hyacinthe argues, colors her work. Hyacinthe examines the development of Mendieta's performative artworks&#x2015;particularly the <i>Silueta</i> series (1973&#x2013;1985), which documented the silhouette of her body in the earth over time (a series &#x201c;without end,&#x201d; Mendieta said)&#x2015;and argues that these works were shaped by Mendieta's appropriation and reimagining of Afro-Cuban ritual. Mendieta's effort to create works that invited audience participation, Hyacinthe says, signals her interest in forging connections with the marginalized, particularly those of the black Atlantic and Global South. Hyacinthe describes the &#x201c;counter entropy&#x201d; of Mendieta's small-scale earthworks (contrasting them with more massive works created by Robert Smithson and other male artists); considers the resonance of Mendieta's work with the contemporary practices of black Atlantic female artists including Wangechi Mutu, Renee Green, and Damali Abrams; and connects Mendieta's artistic and political expressions to black Atlantic feminisms of such popular artists as Princess Nokia. </p><p>Mendieta's life and work are often overshadowed in popular perception by her early and tragic death&#x2015;at thirty-six, she plunged from the window of the thirty-fourth floor Greenwich Village apartment she shared with her husband, the artist Carl Andre. (Andre was charged with her murder and acquitted.)

During that time Florence was one of the largest cities in Europe and a center of commerce and culture. Its gold florin was the standard international currency; Giotto was revolutionizing the art of painting; Dante Alighieri and Guido Cavalcanti were transforming the vernacular love lyric. The era was marked as well by political turmoil and factional strife. The inexorable escalation of violence, as insult and reprisal led to arson and murder, provides the bitter content of Compagni's story.</p><p>Dino Compagni was perfectly placed to observe the political turmoil. A successful merchant, a prominent member of the silk guild, an active member of the government. Gompagni&#x2014;like Dante&#x2014;sided with the Whites and, after their defeat in 1301, was barred from public office. He lived the rest of his life as an exile in his own city, mulling over the events that had led to the defeat of his party.</p><p>This chronicle, the fruit of his observation and reflection, studies the damage wrought by uncontrolled factional strife, the causes of conflict, the connections between events, and the motives of the participants. Compagni judges passionately and harshly. Daniel Bornstein supplements his lucid translation with and extensive historical introduction and explanatory notes.</p></p><p>Daniel Bornstein is Professor of History and Religious Studies at Washington University in St. Louis.Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>Karl Marx, Frederick Engels: Marx and Engels 1843-44 (3) (Volume 3)</h2><p>The price for this volume has been $29.95<br>since its reprinting in 2005.

In this monumental study of the Carrolls in Ireland and America, that act vindicates a family's determination to triumph without compromising lineage and faith.<br>Ronald Hoffman peels back layer after layer of Carroll family history, from dispossession in Ireland to prosperity and prominence in America. Driven to emigrate by England's devastating anti-Catholic policies, the first Carroll brought to Maryland an iron determination to reconstitute his family and fortune. He found instead an increasingly militant Protestant society that ultimately disenfranchised Catholics and threatened their wealth and property. Confronting religious antagonisms like those that had destroyed their Irish ancestors, this Carroll and his descendants founded a fortune--and a dynasty that risked everything by allying with the American Revolutionary cause.<br> Meeting each crisis with a tenacious will to survive and prevail, the Carrolls earned an esteemed place in the new nation. Hoffman balances private lives against their contentious public role in American history. The journey from Irish rebels to American revolutionaries shaped and shattered the Carrolls--and then remade them into one of the first families of the Republic. <br><br><br><br></p><p>"[The authors] present a compelling account not just of Charles the Signer but of the entire Carroll family. . . . Hoffman and Mason transform a family narrative whose moment of glory was a sectarian vignette in 1776 into fully realized scenes within a wider drama of religious strife, colonization, revolution, as well as tense relations across generations and between the sexes."-- <i>Journal of Southern History</i> <br>Ronald Hoffman is director of the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture in Williamsburg, Virginia, and professor of history at the College of William and Mary.</p><h2>The Silent Witness</h2><p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m so sorry, Casey,&#x2019; my link worker John said, sounding weary. &#x2018;I know this is probably the worst time I could ring you, but we desperately need someone to take a child tonight.&#x2019;</p><p>It&#x2019;s the night before Christmas when Casey and Mike get the call.

Historian Paul Avrich considered her a greater literary talent than any other American anarchist&#x201d; and, moreover, a woman whose whole life was a revolt against this system of male domination which, like every form of tyranny and exploitation, ran contrary to her anarchistic spirit.&#x201d; Plagued by poverty and poor health and a nearly successful assassination attempt she maintained an intense schedule of writing, speaking, and organizing for much of her life.

Through an exploration of the ways in which mines in the Atacama Desert of Chile&#x2014;the driest in the world&#x2014;have become intermingled with an expanding constellation of megacities, ports, banks, and factories across East Asia, the book rethinks uneven geographical development in the era of supply chain capitalism. Arguing that extraction entails much more than the mere spatiality of mine shafts and pits, <i>Planetary Mine</i> points towards the expanding webs of infrastructure, of labor, of finance, and of struggle, that drive resource-based industries in the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><p><b>Mart�n Arboleda</b> is based at the School of Sociology of Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago de Chile.

This is a powerful exploration of what we might call &#x2018;actually existing global capitalism.&#x2019; Theoretically fresh and politically compelling, <i>Planetary Mine</i> is destined to be a classic.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Christian Parenti, John Jay College CUNY and author of <i>The Means Proper</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Planetary Mine</i> exquisitely excavates the network and relations that connect the lives of workers in extraction sites to global financial architectures, logistical assemblages, migrating bodies, hungry capitalists, and recalcitrant activists. It robustly debunks the myth of life in a post-material world and charts multiple paths to transforming the uneven and combined geographies of extraction in emancipatory directions. A real eye-opener and instant classic.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Erik Swyngedouw, University of Manchester</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a phenomenal book. Mart�n Arboleda has given us an illuminating work that traces the remaking of the global mining sector in an age of logistical machines, planetary circulatory systems, and Imperialism &#x2018;after the West&#x2019;. With conceptual facility and an inspiring clarity, <i>Planetary Mine</i> offers an engrossing portrait of extractive supply chains and the infrastructures that underpin them. Working across networked front lines, and thinking with diverse and generative literatures, this landmark work insists that we must refuse the social and ecological destruction of extractivism, and shows us how and where that struggle is already underway.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Deborah Cowen</b><br><br>&#x201c;A breathtaking account of the violence of &#x2013; and resistance to &#x2013; extractive capitalism.

For some of these &#39;nontheist&#39; Friends, God is no more (but no less) than a symbol of the wholly human values of &#39;mercy, pity, peace and love&#39;. For others, the idea of God and &#39;God-language&#39; has become an archaism and a stumbling-block. Readers who seek a faith or world-view free of supernaturalism, whether they are Friends, members of other traditions or drop-outs from old-time religion, will find themselves in the company of a varied group whose search for an authentic 21st century understanding of religion and spirituality has led them to declare themselves &#39;Godless - for God&#39;s Sake&#39;.</p><p></p><h2>Writing Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy: 20 Dynamic Essays by the Field's Top Professionals</h2><p><p>Do you dream of -</p><p>Crossing the galaxies? </p><p>Living in the far future?</p><p>Entertaining millions with your imagination?</p><p>This book can help make those dreams come true!</p><p><i>Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy</i> brings you expert advice on how to craft and market tales of the fantastic.

They summarize his previous insights and exhibit their widest range of application-in aesthetics, ethics, politics, and the sciences of man. Each essay opens new perspectives to man's search for reason.<br><br> The first part of <i>Sense and Non-Sense</i>, "Arts," is concerned with Merleau-Ponty's concepts of perception, which were advanced in his major philosophical treatise, <i>Phenomenology of Perception</i>. Here the analysis is focused and enriched in descriptions of the perceptual world of Cezanne, the encounter with the Other as expressed in the novels of Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre, and the <i>gestalt </i>quality of experience brought out in the film art form. In the second part, "Ideas," Merleau-Ponty shows how the categories of the phenomenology of perception can be understood as an outgrowth of the behavioral sciences and how a model of existence based on perception sensitizes us to the insights and limitations of previous philosophies and suggests constructive criticisms of contemporary philosophy. The third part, "Politics," clarifies the political dilemmas facing intellectuals in postwar France.</p><p>Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-61) is the author of <i>Adventures of the Dialectic</i>, <i>Consciousness and the Acquisition of Language</i>, <i>In Praise of Philosophy</i>, <i>The Primacy of Perception</i>, <i>The Prose of the World</i>, <i>Signs</i>, <i>Themes from the Lectures at the College de France, 1952-1960</i>, and <i>The Visible and the Invisible</i>, all published by Northwestern University Press.<br><br> &nbsp;"Although generally ignored in this country, Merleau-Ponty is one of the most influential and gifted philosophers to emerge from the holocaust of World War II. Thanks to this series, some of his works are now appearing for the first time in English translation." &#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br><br>"For the English-speaking psychologist who is interested generally in phenomenological psychology and in Merleau-Ponty's philosophy and conception of the 'behavioral' sciences, this translation must be considered an indispensable work." &#x2014;<i>Review of Existential Psychology and Psychiatry</i></p><h2>The Martian&#39;s Daughter: A Memoir</h2><p><p>One of the five Hungarian scientific geniuses dubbed "the Martians" by their colleagues, John von Neumann is often hailed as the greatest mathematician of the twentieth century and even as the greatest scientist after Einstein. He was a key figure in the Manhattan Project; the inventor of game theory; the pioneer developer of the modern stored-program electronic computer; and an adviser to the top echelons of the American military establishment. In <i>The Martian's Daughter</i>, Marina von Neumann Whitman reveals intimate details about the famed scientist and explores how the cosmopolitan environment in which she was immersed, the demanding expectations of her parents, and her own struggles to emerge from the shadow of a larger-than-life parent shaped her life and work.</p><p>Unfortunately, von Neumann did not live to see his daughter rise to become the first or highest-ranking woman in a variety of arenas. Whitman became a noted academic during the 1960s and '70s, casting her teaching and writing in the framework of globalization before the word had been invented; became the first woman ever to serve on the President's Council of Economic Advisers and participated actively in U.S. efforts to reshape the international monetary and financial system during the early 1970s; pioneered the role of women on the boards of leading multinational corporations; and became the highest-ranking female executive in the American auto industry in the 1980s. In her memoir, Whitman quotes from personal letters from her father and describes her interactions with such figures as Roger Smith of GM and President Nixon. She also details the difficulties she encountered as an early entrant into a world dominated by men and how she overcame the obstacles to, in her words, "have it all."</p></p><p><p><b>Marina von Neumann Whitman </b>is Professor of Business Administration and Public Policy at the University of Michigan. </p><p>"Flipping through the pages of Marina von Neumann Whitman&#x2019;s life...feels like viewing several extraordinary movies in one sitting." <br>&#x2014;Tom Walsh, <i>Detroit Free Press</i></p> (Tom Walsh <i>Detroit Free Press</i> 2012-08-19)</p><h2>The Coen Brothers: Interviews (Conversations with Filmmakers Series)</h2><p><p>Joel and Ethan Coen (b. 1954, 1957) started their careers in obscurity on a shoestring budget cajoled from family and friends in Minneapolis.

Shep is the true story of a dog that became an inspiration to people around the world. Following the death of his owner in 1936, Shep watched as his body was placed on a train and shipped east. For more than five years, through rain and snow, Shep met every incoming train with hopes that he would see the man who had cared for him. Even today, people visit Fort Benton, Montana, to stand at the grave of a dog whose actions remind us of the true meaning of loyalty and heart.Sneed B.

Jo lives in Missoula, Montana along with her husband and son.</p><p>Grade 2-4&#x2013;This picture book celebrates the bond between a sheep dog and his owner. During the Depression, in north central Montana, a sheepherder passed away. Shep watched the man's coffin being loaded onto a train to be returned to his family back east. From that day forward, the loyal canine met every passenger train that arrived at the Fort Benton depot. The station manager and many townspeople noticed him and slowly discovered the details of his life. The people adopted him, feeding him and loving him, until the day he died. News of the dog's death spread throughout the country and his story was featured in <i>Reader's Digest</i>, <i>Lady's Circle</i>, and other major publications. An author's note gives additional background information. Yardley's watercolor paintings, reminiscent of Susan Jeffers's work, are warm, detailed, and textured.

Fourteen thousand Continental Army soldiers tramped from dawn to dusk along the rutted Pennsylvania roads from Gulph Mills to Valley Forge, the site of their winter encampment. After the soldiers came the army&#x2019;s wagons, then hundreds of camp women. <i>Following the Drum: Women at the Valley Forge Encampment</i> tells the story of the forgotten women who spent the winter of 1777&#x2013;78 with the Continental Army at Valley Forge. While the camp women of Washington&#x2019;s army were poor, dirty creatures who clung to the very edge of survival, many worked as the army&#x2019;s washerwomen, nurses, cooks, or seamstresses. Other women at camp were of higher status: they traveled with Washington&#x2019;s entourage when the army headquarters shifted from place to place and served the general as valued cooks, laundresses, or housekeepers. There were also ladies at camp, part of the &#x201c;numerous and splendid&#x201d; audience who enjoyed the camp theater and had their portraits painted by Charles Willson Peale. No evidence suggests that Martha Washington visited informally among the troops at any camp, including Valley Forge.In <i>Following the Drum</i>, readers will learn of the 1777&#x2013;78 encampment&#x2019;s devastating effect on the area&#x2019;s farm families, meet the women and ladies who accompanied and aided the soldiers, and discover a Valley Forge that many never knew existed.</p><p>Nancy K.

Above all, the book is an account of a world in crisis (in Hebrew, mashber means crisis), torn between the competing claims of family, community, business, politics, the individual conscience, and an elusive God.<br><br> At the center of the book are three brothers: the businessman Moshe, at the height of his fortunes as the story begins, but whose luck takes a permanent turn for the worse; the religious seeker Luzi, who, for all his otherworldliness, finds himself ever more caught up in worldly affairs; and the idiot-savant Alter, whose reclusive existence is tortured by fear and sexual desire. The novel is also haunted by the enigmatic figure of Sruli Gol, a drunk, a profaner of sacred things, an outcast, who nonetheless finds his way through every door and may well hold the key to the brothers&#x2019; destinies.</p><p><p>Der Nister (1884&#x2013;1950) was the pen name used by Pinhas Kahanovitch, a Yiddish writer, philosopher, translator, critic, and key figure in modernist literature in Kiev in the 1920s.

From a succession of glittering, cosmopolitan capitals, Islamic empires lorded it over the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and swathes of the Indian subcontinent, while Europe cowered feebly at the margins. For centuries the caliphate was both ascendant on the battlefield and triumphant in the battle of ideas, its cities unrivaled powerhouses of artistic grandeur, commercial power, spiritual sanctity, and forward-looking thinking, in which nothing was off limits.<br><br><em>Islamic Empires</em> is a history of this rich and diverse civilization told through its greatest cities over the fifteen centuries of Islam, from its earliest beginnings in Mecca in the seventh century to the astonishing rise of Doha in the twenty-first.<br><br> Marozzi brilliantly connects the defining moments in Islamic history: from the Prophet Mohammed receiving his divine revelations in Mecca and the First Crusade of 1099 to the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 and the phenomenal creation of the merchant republic of Beirut in the nineteenth century, and how this world is continuing to change today.</p><p>Justin Marozzi is a former Financial Times and Economist foreign correspondent.

Photographs, many rare and never before published, taken over five decades by some of the world&#x2019;s top photographers, follow them from their earliest performances in the 1960s, when Mary was the most desired, beautiful, and charismatic performer and a new role model for women. Follow the trio as they lead America to discover the passionate soul of folk music. Join the struggle for racial equality, social justice, and freedom in this memorable journey, from the historic 1963 March on Washington with Martin Luther King, Jr., to the trio&#x2019;s appearance before a half million people in 1969 to end the Vietnam War, to their singing at the Hollywood Bowl for Survival Sunday in 1978, helping to launch the anti-nuke movement, the world&#x2019;s first international environmental movement.<br> Through these images, readers will feel and almost hear the trio&#x2019;s songs calling for a more caring, better world as they performed with a courage and conviction that became for so many the embodiment and soundtrack of their generation&#x2019;s awakening to conscience, to activism, and to a new dream for all of humankind. Peter, Paul, and Mary&#x2019;s songs of defiant hope and a certain unmasked innocence are still a powerful part of our American consciousness, and this book reenacts the history of how the trio marked many lives with their indelible stamp of honesty of the sort we all yearn to recapture and recreate today&#x2014;for ourselves, our children, and the generations to come.</p><p>Peter, Paul, and Mary came into being at the dawn of John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s presidency, as America entered one of its most dramatic periods of social and political change. With music being one of the great forces that brought them together, Americans united in unprecedented ways to create a more just and peaceful society. Folk music, with its ability to reach people&#x2019;s hearts, became the sound track of this remarkable quest, and Peter, Paul, and Mary became standard-bearers of America&#x2019;s new hopes and dreams.I was a college kid on a cold Connecticut night in 1964 when I first heard Mary&#x2019;s angelic alto. On that night in New Haven and on so many nights over the next five decades, in so many places all over the world, Peter, Paul and Mary&#x2019;s music asked more of us than to simply sing along. &#x201c;The hammer of justice&#x201d; and &#x201c;the bell of freedom!&#x201d; These are more than just lyrics; they were then, and they remain, a call to conscience, and as Peter especially has always reminded me, when something pulls at your conscience, you need to act.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Peter, Paul and Mary journeyed from coffeehouses and campuses to the Billboard Top 40, there could be no doubt that we were all living in turbulent times. But in their harmonies was a magic and message more powerful than a decade of discord and exhilaration.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why, after all these years, we return to the music. That is why when we turn the pages of this incredible book, we are questioned, liberated, and challenged once again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know my experience with Peter, Paul and Mary is one that I shared with so many in those years of challenge and transformation. Their music became an anchor: &#x201c;Blowin&#x2019; in the Wind&#x201d; as the war in Vietnam escalated. &#x201c;Leavin&#x2019; on a Jet Plane&#x201d; as I left to join the war. &#x201c;Puff, the Magic Dragon&#x201d; as I patrolled the Mekong Delta. Their songs became the soundtrack of my life and of a generation.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They changed the cultural fabric of this nation forever. Peter, Paul and Mary brought folk music from the shadows of the McCarthy blacklist era to the living rooms and radio stations of every town in America. They gave the world its first listen to young songwriting talents from Bob Dylan to John Denver, Gordon Lightfoot to Laura Nyro.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And though their music might stop and the band would break up for years, they never stopped marching. They marched for peace, for racial justice, for workers&#x2019; rights. They marched against gun violence, homelessness, and world hunger. They marched for clean air and clean water, against apartheid and nuclear proliferation.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through both their songs and their struggle, they helped propel our nation on its greatest journey, on the march toward greater equality. With their passion and persistence, Peter, Paul and Mary helped widen the circle of our democracy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at Dr. King&#x2019;s March on Washington, that Peter, Paul and Mary first performed &#x201c;Blowin&#x2019; in the Wind.&#x201d; On that day and for decades thereafter, they made it clear that it was up to all of us to reach for the answer by reaching out to one another and to the world. Their message was not defined by protest but by taking responsibility&#x2014;taking the risks that peace, the most powerful answer of all, always requires.<br> -John F.

When she was just 12, she discovered the first whole ichthyosaurus skeleton; later, aged 22, she found the first whole skeleton of a plesiosaurus, and this find gained her international fame. She was unusual then&#x2014;as she would be now&#x2014;in being a woman geologist, and she was also a curiosity in being both provincial and lower class when science was dominated by upper class London gentlemen. During her lifetime she won the respect of contemporary scientists, receiving an annuity from the British Association for the Advancement of Science during the last decade of her life. Upon her death, Dickens wrote "the carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and deserved to win it." After her death, however, scientists wrote her out of their books, crediting instead the naturalists who had bought her specimens with her discoveries. It was inconceivable to them that an uneducated woman had produced such astonishing work.&nbsp;This biography&nbsp;rescues the now little-known life of this extraordinary woman from undeserved obscurity to reveal her full and fascinating life.</p></p><p><b>Patricia Pierce</b>&nbsp;is the author of Old London Bridge and&nbsp;<i>The Great Shakespeare Fraud</i>.</p><h2>The Death of Kings: A Medical History of the Kings and Queens of England</h2><p>A catalogue of the ailments of Britain&#39;s monarchs of from Edward the Confessor to Victoria, written by a surgeon.

Its purpose is to identify the key films and motifs of noir and to analyze in depth the prototypical pictures that, while vivid examples of certain cinematic themes, bend and break their molds to find new ways to enthrall and frighten us. Like its predecessors, <i>Film Noir Reader 4</i> is generously illustrated and features essays by such respected film critics and scholars as Robin Wood, J.P. Telotte, R. Barton Palmer, and Robert Porfirio. All have as their purpose to explain why and how these classic films work; the way screenplay, direction, acting, cinematography, editing and all the other filmmaking crafts blended together to produce work that exemplifies both a particular movement in film history and the innovations that keep the noir style fresh and compelling.</p><p></p><h2>A Feathered River Across the Sky: The Passenger Pigeon&#39;s Flight to Extinction</h2><p><p>In the early nineteenth century 25 to 40 percent of North America's birds were passenger pigeons, traveling in flocks so massive as to block out the sun for hours or even days. The down beats of their wings would chill the air beneath and create a thundering roar that would drown out all other sound. Feeding flocks would appear as &#x201c;a blue wave four or five feet high rolling toward you.&#x201d;</p><p>John James Audubon, impressed by their speed and agility, said a lone passenger pigeon streaking through the forest &#x201c;passes like a thought.&#x201d; How prophetic-for although a billion pigeons crossed the skies 80 miles from Toronto in May of 1860, little more than fifty years later passenger pigeons were extinct. The last of the species, Martha, died in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo on September 1, 1914.</p><p>As naturalist Joel Greenberg relates in gripping detail, the pigeons' propensity to nest, roost, and fly together in vast numbers made them vulnerable to unremitting market and recreational hunting. The spread of railroads and telegraph lines created national markets that allowed the birds to be pursued relentlessly. Passenger pigeons inspired awe in the likes of Audubon, Henry David Thoreau, James Fenimore Cooper, and others, but no serious effort was made to protect the species until it was way too late. Greenberg's beautifully written story of the passenger pigeon provides a cautionary tale of what happens when species and natural resources are not harvested sustainably.</p></p><p><b>Joel Greenberg</b> is a research associate of the Chicago Academy of Sciences Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum and the Field Museum.

Eliot&#x2019;s masterpiece reappears with a major introduction by Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winner Paul Muldoon.</strong></p><em>The Waste Land</em> is arguably the most important poem of the twentieth century. First published in the United States by Boni &amp; Liveright in 1922, this landmark reissue of the first edition, now back with its original publisher, includes a new introduction by Paul Muldoon, showcasing the poem's searing power and strange, jarring beauty. With a modernist design that matches the original, this edition allows contemporary readers to experience the poem the way readers would have seen it for the first time. <p>As Muldoon writes, "It's almost impossible to think of a world in which <em>The Waste Land</em> did not exist. So profound has its influence been not only on twentieth-century poetry but on how we&#x2019;ve come to view the century as a whole, the poem itself risks being taken for granted." Famously elliptical, wildly allusive, at once transcendent and bleak, <em>The Waste Land</em> defined modernity after the First World War, forever transforming our understanding of ourselves, the broken world we live in, and the literature that was meant to make sense of it. In a voice that is arch, ironic, almost ebullient, and yet world-weary and tragic, T. S. Eliot mixes and remixes, drawing on a cast of ghosts to create a new literature for a new world. In the words of Edmund Wilson, "Eliot...is one of our only authentic poets...[<em>The Waste Land</em> is] one triumph after another."</p></p><p><p><strong>T. S. Eliot</strong> (1888&#x2013;1965) was one of the fathers of modernism and a defining voice in English-language poetry. He is the author of some of the best known poems in the English language, including "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," <em>The Waste Land</em>, "Ash Wednesday," and <em>Four Quartets</em>. The leading poet of the modernist avant-garde, Eliot radically reimagined the possibilities for literature in the twentieth century and beyond, and was also renowned as a playwright and as a literary and social critic. Eliot's books of criticism include <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, while his theatrical works include <em>Murder in the Cathedral</em>. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1948.</p><p><strong>Paul Muldoon</strong> is the author of numerous volumes of poetry, including, most recently, <em>The Word on the Street</em>. He is the poetry editor of <em>The New Yorker</em> and the Howard G. B. Clark '21 Professor in the Humanities at Princeton University. His awards include the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and the T. S. Eliot Prize.</p>&#x201c;We know of no other modern poet who can more adequately and movingly reveal to us the inextricable tangle of the sordid and the beautiful that make up life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Times Literary Supplement</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Waste Land</em> is unquestionably important, unquestionably brilliant...The poem must be taken&#x2015;most invitingly offers itself&#x2015;as a brilliant and kaleidoscopic confusion; as a series of sharp, discrete, slightly related perceptions and feelings, dramatically and lyrically presented, and violently juxtaposed...It shimmers, it suggests, it gives the desired strangeness...One of the most moving and original poems of our time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Conrad Aiken</strong><br><br>&#x201c;[An achievement] of the first importance for English poetry.

Three local women notice the couple's suspicious behaviour and apprehend them. The two are handed over to the police, charged and sent for trial. A month later, a young doctor is shot dead on the streets of Mohill, Co. Leitrim. The two incidents are connected, but how?<br><br>In the days following the shooting of Dr Paddy Muldoon, the name of a local priest was linked to the killing and&nbsp; rumours abounded of a connection to the events in Dublin a month earlier and also that an IRA gang had been recruited to carry out the murder. However, despite an investigation at the time, the murder remained unsolved for almost 100 years. Now, newly discovered archive material from a range of sources, including the Muldoon family, has made it possible to piece together the circumstances surrounding the doctor's death, and reveals how far senior figures in the Church, State and IRA were willing to go to cover up a scandal.</p><p></p><h2>Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo (Great Books in Philosophy)</h2><p>As the indisputable father of Western philosophy, Socrates stands as the archetype of free inquiry and intellectual honesty throughout history. He dared to explore the minds of men, to analyze the content of cherished beliefs, and to distinguish knowledge and truth from opinion. This philosophical gadfly irritated the people of Athens, who tried him for corrupting their youth, and subsequently sentenced him to death for his &#34;crime.&#34;In these four short works by Plato, we come to experience the full range of Socrates&#39; penetrating mind. In the Euthyphro, Socrates searches after the truth about the nature of piety, even as he makes his way to Athens to answer an indictment leveled against him.The Apology recounts Socrates&#39; attempt to defend himself against the charge of impiety. Once condemned, Socrates finds himself imprisoned to await death.The Crito captures his views on his relationship with the state and what each has a right to expect from the other.Finally, the Phaedo recalls the death scene as Socrates discusses the nature of the soul and immortality just before succumbing to the hemlock.</p><p><b>PLATO</b>&nbsp;was born about 427 B.C.E. into the distinguished Athenian family of Ariston and Perictione. Although interested in politics as a young man, he became disenchanted with the cruel and immoral behavior of Athenian rulers. Some small ray of hope emerged when Athens deposed its dictators and established a democracy; however, when the citizens put the philosopher Socrates on trial and later executed him for impiety, Plato left Athens to travel abroad.<br><br>In 387 B.C.E., Plato finally returned to Athens and created the Academy, an intellectual center for philosophy and science that offered scholarly training in such fields as astronomy, biological sciences, mathematics, and political science. From this influen�tial institution emerged Aristotle, Plato's most famous student. Plato dedicated himself to the Academy until his death in about 347 B.C.E.<br><br>During his lifetime Plato wrote a number of supremely important dialogues, which presented and critically analyzed significant philosophical ideas in metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and social and political philosophy&#x2014;all of which con�tinue to engage posterity. His better-known dialogues include:&nbsp;<i>The Apology, Cratylus, Crito, Euthyphro, Gorgias, The Laws, Meno, Parmenides, Phaedo, Phaedrus, Protagoras, The Repub�lic, The Sophist, The Symposium, Theaetetus,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Timaeus.</i></p><h2>The Age of Globalization: Anarchists and the Anticolonial Imagination</h2><p>The exchange of ideas makes history as surely as the exchange of&nbsp;gunfire. <i>The Age of Globalization </i>(previously published as Under&nbsp;Three Flags) is an account of the unlikely connections that made&nbsp;up late nineteenth-century politics and culture.

How can you get a leg up and win?</b><br><br> Win-win&#x201d; negotiation is an appealing idea on an intellectual level: Find the best way to convince the other side to accept a mutually beneficial outcome, and then everyone gets their fair share. The reality, though, is that people want more than their fair share; they want to win. Tell your boss that you've concocted a deal that gets your company a piece of the pie, and the reaction is likely to be: Maybe we need to find someone harder-nosed than you who knows how to win. We want the whole pie, not just a slice.&#x201d; However, to return to an earlier era before win-win&#x201d; negotiation was in fashion and seek simply to dominate or bully opponents into submission would be a step in the wrong direction and a public relations disaster.<br><br>By showing how to win at win-win negotiating, Lawrence Susskind provides the operational advice you need to satisfy the interests of your back table the people to whom you report. He also shows you how to deal with irrational people, whose vocabulary seems limited to no,&#x201d; or with the proverbial 900-pound gorilla. He explains how to find trades that create much more value than either you or your opponent thought possible. His brilliant concept of the trading zone&#x201d; the space where you can create deals that are good for them but great for you,&#x201d; while still maintaining trust and keeping relationships intact is a fresh way to re-think your approach to negotiating. The outcome is often the best of both possible worlds: You claim a disproportionate share of the value you've created while your opponents still look good to the people to whom they report.<br><br>Whether the venue is business, a family dispute, international relations, or a tradeoff that has to be made between the environment and jobs, Susskind provides a breakthrough in how to both think about, and engage in, productive negotiations.<br></p><p><b>Lawrence Susskind</b> is cofounder of the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, Ford Foundation Professor of Urban and Environmental Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the founder and chief knowledge officer of the Consensus Building Institute. He has served on the faculty at MIT for more than forty years. Dr. Susskind has mediated complex disputes involving land and water rights; advised more than fifty corporations, particularly with regard to regulatory negotiations; provided advanced negotiation training to more than 30,000 professionals from around the world; and served as an adviser to the supreme courts of Israel, Ireland, and the Philippines."[Susskind] offers innovative ways to head off foreseeable problems... A useful guide with broad applications beyond the world of business." <b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br> Fortunately, this dense material is presented in a warm, collegial tone and structured in manageable chapters, which are in turn broken up by subheadings punctuated by snappy call-out boxes of text. Full of valuable advice, this title is a must-read for business or law school curricula and anyone who needs to negotiate in today's global marketplace.&#x201d; <b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><h2>Hal Leonard Mandolin Method - Book 1: Second Edition (Book/Online Audio)</h2><p>(Mandolin).

Peter London offers inspiration and fresh ideas to artists, art students, and art teachers&#x2014;as well as to people who think they can't draw a straight line but want to explore the joys of creative expression. Inside every person, he believes, there is an original, creative self that has been covered over by secondhand ideas, borrowed beliefs, and conditioned behavior. By freeing the capacity for visual expression&#x2014;a natural human language possessed by everyone&#x2014;we can awaken and release the full powers of that original self. Among the topics and exercises included are: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; How to increase the ability to visualize, fantasize, and dream <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Obstacles to the creative encounter and what to do about them <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Experimenting with art media as true mediators between imagination and expression <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Making masks to reveal the hidden self <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Painting with "forbidden" colors <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Arranging found objects as metaphors for one's life</p><p>about using art as an instrument of personal transformation, enabling us to move from an inherited to a chosen state of being.Peter London&#x2014;painter, author, art educator, and art therapist&#x2014;has taught the approach presented in this and other books to thousands of students, ranging from teens to octogenarians, from "art phobics" to professional artists.

I hope you will find some that you like - In going where you have to go, and doing what you have to do, and seeing what you have to see, you dull and blunt the instrument you write with. But I would rather have it bent and dulled and know I had to put it on the grindstone and hammer it into shape and put a whetstone to it, and know that I had something to write about, than to have it bright and shining, and nothing to say, or smooth and well-oiled in the closet, but unused.&#39; This is a collection of Hemingway&#39;s first forty-nine short stories, featuring a brief introduction by the author and lesser known as well as familiar tales, including &#34;Up in Michigan&#34;, &#34;Fifty Grand&#34;, and &#34;The Light of the World&#34;, and the &#34;Snows of Kilimanjaro&#34;, &#34;Winner Take Nothing&#34; and &#34;Men Without Women&#34; collections.</p><p>The Short Stories, originally published in 1938, is definitive. Among these forty-nine short stories are Hemingway&#39;s earliest efforts, written when he was a young foreign correspondent in Paris, and such masterpieces as &#39;Hills Like White Elephants, &#39; &#39;The Killers, &#39; &#39;The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber, &#39; and &#39;The Snows of Kilimanjaro.&#39;Ernest Miller Hemingway was born in Chicago in 1899 as the son of a doctor and the second of six children. After a stint as an ambulance driver at the Italian front, Hemingway came home to America in 1919, only to return to the battlefield - this time as a reporter on the Greco-Turkish war - in 1922. Resigning from journalism to focus on his writing instead, he moved to Paris where he renewed his earlier friendship with fellow American expatriates such as Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. Through the years, Hemingway travelled widely and wrote avidly, becoming an internationally recognized literary master of his craft. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, following the publication of The Old Man and the Sea. He died in 1961.</p><h2>Science &amp; Christianity: Four Views (Spectrum Multiview Book)</h2><p>Science and Christianity. Are they partners or opponents? Christians have long debated the relationship of science to faith. With the rise of Darwinism, however, the issue took on new significance. Darwinism appeared to undermine the authority of the Bible and the credibility of Christianity by freeing science of the need for a Creator. Rethinking the relationship between science and Christianity quickly became a priority. <ul><li>How does a faithful Christian respond to the pronouncements of contemporary science?</li><li>Is science a help or a hindrance to belief?</li><li>Are science and the Bible in conflict?</li></ul> At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Christians continue to wonder whether faith and science are partners or opponents. In this book six Christian scholars sort through the issues as they present four different views on the relationship of science and Christianity. These include Wayne Frair and Gary D. Patterson for "creationism," Jean Pond for "independence," Stephen C. Meyer for "qualified agreement" and Howard J. Van Till for "partnership." Each contributor responds to the other scholars, noting points of agreement and disagreement. Editor Richard F. Carlson offers an introduction to this contemporary debate as well as a postscript to help us evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each view.</p><p>Richard F. Carlson is research professor of physics at the University of Redlands in Redlands, California and formerly a visiting scientist in the department of radiation sciences at Uppsala University, Sweden. He received a B.S. (University of Redlands), M.S. and Ph.D. (University of Minnesota) in physics, and an M. A. (Fuller Theological Seminary) in biblical studies and theology. His physics research interests are in experimental nuclear physics, and he has done postdoctoral research at UCLA. While teaching at the University of Redlands he has continued his nuclear research at UCLA, the University of Manitoba, University of California Davis, and currently at Uppsala University. Carlson has published more than fifty articles in physics research journals. Recently his interests have shifted to the area of science and Christian faith, and between 1995 and 2005 he taught a number of science and theology courses at the University of Redlands and Fuller Theological Seminary. His courses at Redlands and Fuller have resulted in two Templeton Foundation prizes. He is the general editor of <em>Science &amp; Christianity: Four Views</em> (InterVarsity Press, 2000), as well as the author of a number of articles appearing in nuclear physics research journals and theological journals.</p><h2>Fool Me Twice (2) (Rules for the Reckless)</h2><p>In the vein of Sarah MacLean, a sexy and evocative Regency romance between a vengeful duke and a fiery redhead from an author who is a veritable tour de force in the genre. &#x201c;Readers need to make room on their keeper shelf for Meredith Duran&#x201d; (Fresh Fiction).<br><br>A LADY WITH A SECRET<br> <br>Running for her life, exhausted and out of options, Olivia Holladay wants nothing more than the chance to make a home for herself. So when she realizes that the infamous Duke of Marwick might hold the key to her freedom, she boldly disguises herself as the newest and bravest in a long line of the duke&#x2019;s notoriously temperamental housekeepers. Little does she know that the wickedly handsome Alastair de Grey has very different plans for her.<br> <br>A MAN WITH A PASSION&#x2014;FOR VENGEANCE<br> <br>As his new employee, Olivia is a fearless upstart. As a woman, the daring redhead is just what Alastair needs to rouse him from darkness to the siren call of revenge. He has suffered a betrayal so deep that he will use whatever means necessary to destroy his enemies&#x2014;even his brazen and beautiful domestic. But his vengeful plan fails to account for his single weakness: an irresistible and growing passion for the enigmatic Olivia.</p><p>Meredith Duran is the <i>USA TODAY</i> bestselling author of thirteen novels. She blames Anne Boleyn for sparking her lifelong obsession with British history (and for convincing her that princely love is no prize if it doesn&#x2019;t come with a happily-ever-after). She enjoys collecting old etiquette manuals, guidebooks to nineteenth-century London, and travelogues by intrepid Victorian women.Fool Me Twice CHAPTER ONE<p></p> <br><br> <br>London, 1885<br> <br>Olivia drew up before the scene of her next crime. Was it her imagination, or did the townhouse loom? All the other mansions on this street looked polite and elegant, neatly confining themselves within rows of trimmed hedges. This house, on the other hand, sprawled. She spied a gargoyle lurking above one cornice, glowering at her. Of course the Duke of Marwick would have a gargoyle carved into his house!<br> <br>She crossed her arms and glowered back. She was a thief now, wasn&#x2019;t she? No matter that, for all her twenty-five years, she had prayed before bedtime and gasped at curses. Now she was a criminal. Criminals should not fear anything&#x2014;not even the Duke of Marwick, tyrant extraordinaire.<br> <br>Brave thoughts. But her stomach was jumping like she&#x2019;d eaten spoiled food.<br> <br>She pivoted away, pacing to the hedges that marked the next lot. God in heaven. Was this the kind of woman she wanted to be? She&#x2019;d told herself she had no choice, but that was a lie. One always had a choice. She could run again, flee to France, or even farther . . .<br> <br>The autumn breeze carried a child&#x2019;s laugh to her ears. In the park at the center of the square, a little boy was playing chase with a puppy. He ran in circles, shrieking with delight as the spaniel nipped his heels. Was he all alone?<br> <br>Her concern faded when she spotted the couple watching from the shade of the elm trees. They were not a nanny and footman, as one typically saw supervising the young heirs of Mayfair, but a married couple, the husband fair and slim, with an elegant gold watch pinned to his lapel. The wife, plump and pink cheeked, hugged his arm as she smiled at her son.<br> <br>A knot rose in Olivia&#x2019;s throat. If she walked away now, it would never be safe to make a home. She would always be alone. Always running.<br> <br>Strictly speaking, theft and fraud were immoral. But her cause was just, and her prospective victim, a bully. Marwick deserved a taste of his own medicine. She would not feel guilty!<br> <br>She nudged her spectacles up her nose and marched back to the duke&#x2019;s townhouse. The brass knocker felt slippery in her hand. The advertisement was a week old; the maid&#x2019;s position might have been filled already. All her agonizing would be for nothing.<br> <br>The door opened. A young brunette set her shoulder against the doorjamb and looked up at Olivia. &#x201c;Oo-oo. Tall as a man, ain&#x2019;t you? Come about the position, I expect.&#x201d;<br> <br>It had taken several days for Olivia to persuade Amanda to write the reference. But in a second, she saw that she might as well have forged it herself. Nobody was going to check its authenticity, not when they had this creature answering the door. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The maid&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome to the madhouse, then. Me name&#x2019;s Polly.&#x201d; The girl waved Olivia into the chill of the lobby, a cavernous space tiled in checkerboard marble. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Jones you&#x2019;ll want to see. He&#x2019;s in the butler&#x2019;s pantry. Don&#x2019;t ask what he does there; nobody can say.&#x201d;<br> <br>Olivia followed the girl past what looked to be the scene of a fight, remnants of a shattered vase strewn along the wall. Or perhaps only neglect was to blame, for the Grecian urn by the stairs held masses of withered roses, and the air smelled sour, as though somebody had laid down vinegar for cleaning and forgotten to mop it up again.<br> <br>A madhouse, indeed. It was the master who had gone mad first, Olivia guessed. Her former employer, Elizabeth Chudderley (from whom she had stolen), had called the Duke of Marwick a bully and a tyrant, for his ruthless opposition of Elizabeth&#x2019;s marriage to his brother. But this house suggested he was less exacting of his servants than of his family. How bizarre!<br> <br>A bully, she reminded herself. Marwick was a boor, a monster. Cheating him would be criminal, but not unforgivable&#x2014;unlike her theft from Elizabeth.<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;ll have heard about our duke,&#x201d; Polly said as they stepped into the servants&#x2019; passage.<br> <br>For a stupid moment, Olivia thought the girl had read her mind. And then she gathered her wits. &#x201c;Of course. The Duke of Marwick has done so many wonderful&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Polly&#x2019;s snort spared Olivia the distasteful task of praising him. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know the half of it.&#x201d; And as they descended the stairs, she commenced a chattering monologue, full of sordid details that supplied the larger picture.<br> <br>The housekeeper had quit nine days ago, after an episode in which the duke had thrown a shoe at her. Since then, half the maids had fled. Oh, the pay was still good, but you couldn&#x2019;t expect a lunatic to live long, could you? To be sure, he was only thirty-five. But the duke had not left the house in ten months. If that wasn&#x2019;t lunacy, what was?<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been grand fun,&#x201d; Polly concluded as they emerged into the servants&#x2019; gallery. &#x201c;Like being paid to see a stage show!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d; Olivia felt slightly sick. Thanks to the letters she had stolen from Elizabeth, she knew far more of the situation than she should. She even knew why Marwick was deranged.<br> <br>Several months ago, Elizabeth had come into possession of letters written by the duke&#x2019;s late wife. These letters revealed the duchess to have been unfaithful and treacherous. The duke, upon learning it, had turned from a grieving widower into a half-mad hermit&#x2014;and perhaps a drunkard, too, for what else could have driven him to throw shoes at the housekeeper?<br> <br>Polly banged on the door to the butler&#x2019;s pantry. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve a new one,&#x201d; she called.<br> <br>The door opened a crack. A hand shot out, pudgy fingers snapping up Olivia&#x2019;s reference. The door slammed shut again.<br> <br>Polly crossed her arms and tapped her foot. &#x201c;Now, now,&#x201d; she said loudly. &#x201c;This one looks promising. I swear to you, it wasn&#x2019;t Bradley who summoned her.&#x201d; She cut Olivia a grin. &#x201c;One of the footmen. Thought it&#x2019;d make a fine joke to summon a painted lady for an interview. Poor Jones, he wasn&#x2019;t amused.&#x201d;<br> <br>Olivia grew conscious of her own increasingly stiff posture. Did the butler have no spine? Why did he not sack Bradley?<br> <br>That isn&#x2019;t your business, she reminded herself. The disarray of this household would work to her advantage. Her aim was to rifle the duke&#x2019;s belongings, for his late wife&#x2019;s letters suggested that he kept files on his political colleagues, dossiers that evidenced their crimes. If this was true, then Olivia needed to find the files. There was a certain man she very much needed to blackmail.<br> <br>She had anticipated a great many watchful eyes ready to catch her in the act of prying. But this lot? They wouldn&#x2019;t notice if she stole the silver! Assuming any silver remained to be stolen, of course.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky,&#x201d; Polly said, jarring Olivia from her reverie. &#x201c;Old Jones is so desperate, he&#x2019;ll probably not care that you wear spectacles. But in the normal course, ain&#x2019;t much call for a maid who can&#x2019;t see.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Blinking, Olivia nudged her glasses back up to their proper place. She had never considered that detail.<br> <br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;ll have to stop coloring your hair,&#x201d; Polly added with a tsk. &#x201c;Fine shade of red, but a bit too loud for service.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t color my hair.&#x201d; She had considered it for the sake of disguise, but the lighter shades did not stick, and the darkest would have looked unnatural.<br> <br>Polly gave her a skeptical look. &#x201c;Right-o. Mother Nature just got frisky, I suppose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I tell you, this is my natural color.&#x201d; And if she had dyed her hair, she certainly would not have chosen the shade.<br> <br>The door opened. Jones proved to be a distinguished gentleman in black tails, with bulldog jowls and hair as silver as a groat. He clutched Olivia&#x2019;s reference like a drowning man to driftwood. &#x201c;This looks quite satisfactory, Miss Johnson.&#x201d;<br> <br>Polly gave Olivia a questioning look. &#x201c;Miss Johnson, is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mere parlor maids did not deserve such a formal address. Olivia had a sinking feeling that Amanda had not obeyed her instructions: omit from the reference any mention of Olivia&#x2019;s education, and emphasize instead her experience in cleaning and caring for a grand home. Not that she had any, in truth. . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Come, come,&#x201d; said Jones, pushing himself through the doorway and all but scrambling for the stairs. &#x201c;Follow me, if you please.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>&#x201c;Our finest drawing room,&#x201d; Jones announced. He waved her out of the salon, setting a brisk pace down the corridor. &#x201c;You worked two years in Lady Ripton&#x2019;s household?&#x201d;<br> <br>Olivia rushed to keep up. Roman statues lined the hallway, their stiff, marbled faces gazing with disapproval on this unlikely scene: the butler, who was meant to stand at the top of the servants&#x2019; hierarchy, giving a tour to his prospective underling. &#x201c;Yes, sir. I served two years as an upstairs maid.&#x201d;<br> <br>This was a lie, of course. Olivia was a secretary by training. But it was her good fortune that Amanda, her former classmate at the typing school, had recently married Viscount Ripton. This made Amanda&#x2019;s recommendations very powerful things to own. If the Viscountess Ripton said that Olivia had been a housemaid par excellence, then this poor, beleaguered butler would not doubt it.<br> <br>&#x201c;I do wonder . . .&#x201d; Jones was scratching his chin. He seemed very interested in one spot in particular, a patch of whiskers beneath his ear that he had obviously missed during his morning ablutions. The silver hair there sprouted a full inch longer than the rest of his beard.<br> <br>Beneath her fascinated gaze, he recalled his manners, flushing as he tucked his hand back into his waistcoat. &#x201c;Are you, by any chance, lettered?&#x201d;<br> <br>She could have answered him in French, Italian, or German. But it seemed rather showy&#x2014;and improbable, for a housemaid. &#x201c;Yes, sir. I can read and write.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose you can do figures as well?&#x201d;<br> <br>That was also not among the housemaid&#x2019;s usual skills. But the pleading look Jones fixed on her was impossible to resist. How desperate he appeared. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m quite good at figures.&#x201d;<br> <br>Relief flashed over Jones&#x2019;s face, followed, puzzlingly, by what looked like pure trepidation. He came to a stop by another door. &#x201c;The library,&#x201d; he said&#x2014;but before he could show it to her, raucous laughter exploded around the corner, causing him to wince. &#x201c;Today is rather unsettled,&#x201d; he said hastily. &#x201c;But I assure you, I do not tolerate such disarray on a typical basis.&#x201d;<br> <br>His embarrassment was contagious. As the giggles came again, Olivia felt herself turning red to match him. &#x201c;Of course not, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>Two maids spilled around the corner, one of them holding open a magazine, the other craning to gawk at it. Jones stiffened. &#x201c;Muriel!&#x201d;<br> <br>The girls startled&#x2014;and then, to Olivia&#x2019;s astonishment, they turned on their heels and scampered back the way they had come.<br> <br>Jones scowled after them. But his spirit was sadly broken, Olivia saw; rather than summoning them for a well-deserved scolding, he sighed and shook his head. &#x201c;Have you any questions for me, Miss Johnson?&#x201d;<br> <br>She consulted herself. &#x201c;Well&#x2014;wages, of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Twenty-five pounds per annum, increasing to thirty after five years&#x2019; service. Anything else?&#x201d;<br> <br>She wracked her brain for typical concerns. &#x201c;When His Grace closes the house, will we travel with him? Or will we be kept on here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Instantly she regretted the question, for Jones darted her an agonized look. &#x201c;I do not think . . .&#x201d; He cleared his throat. &#x201c;His Grace will not close the house this year.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nobody stayed in London during the winter. She tried to mask her shock. &#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You may have heard . . .&#x201d; The butler hesitated. &#x201c;I wish to assure you that His Grace is everything one could wish for in an employer.&#x201d;<br> <br>Poor Jones. He sounded so disheartened by his lie. Olivia restrained the urge to touch his elbow in comfort. &#x201c;I have no doubt, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>And that was not the kind of lie she had expected to tell today. Indeed, she&#x2019;d anticipated having to prostrate herself. This was, after all, the household of the most feared figure in British politics: Alastair de Grey, fifth Duke of Marwick, friend to princes, patron of prime ministers, and puppet master of countless MPs. His upper staff, she&#x2019;d assumed, would be overproud and haughty, like all servants in grand houses.<br> <br>But if Marwick had once governed the nation, he now failed to govern even his own home. His servants were running wild. It made no sense to Olivia. Elizabeth had spoken of him as an all-powerful bully . . . but a bully never would have tolerated this chaos.<br> <br>And once she stole from him, this beleaguered butler&#x2014;the only one here who showed a lick of sense&#x2014;would bear the blame for having hired her.<br> <br>She couldn&#x2019;t do it. To take advantage of this miserable fellow was too sordid. &#x201c;Mr. Jones,&#x201d; she began, just as he spoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss Johnson, I have a terribly unorthodox proposition.&#x201d; He took a deep breath, like a diver preparing himself for the plunge. &#x201c;We are lacking a housekeeper. As you&#x2014;as I am sure the maids already told you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Indeed, they did not,&#x201d; she lied. How far gone he was! Mr. Jones should not depend on the staff&#x2019;s gossiping. His task was to prevent it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, yes. She gave notice . . . rather abruptly. And I do wonder . . .&#x201d; Jones mopped his forehead with a handkerchief. &#x201c;That is, it occurs to me . . . Lady Ripton spoke most highly of you; why, she even said she felt you were lowering yourself to this position, having served, in her time of need, as an amanuensis, a companion and secretary&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>She had told Amanda not to embroider the point. &#x201c;Lady Ripton is too kind. It&#x2019;s true, once in a great rare while, I did assist her&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, here&#x2019;s the rub.&#x201d; The words tumbled over each other; it was evident that Jones was aghast at his own proposal, and wished to get through it as quickly as possible. &#x201c;Until we find a replacement, I require someone to fill Mrs. Wright&#x2019;s shoes. You are educated; you are familiar with the ways of the better classes. I wonder if you might not step into her post&#x2014;until, of course, I can find her replacement. Only until then.&#x201d;<br> <br>Olivia caught her breath. This was a stroke of luck beyond all imagining. She needed a weapon very badly indeed. The Duke of Marwick was likely in possession of this weapon. And a housekeeper would have license to look everywhere for it.<br> <br>But&#x2014;her spirits sank&#x2014;it would still be fraud. And it would still cost Jones his job, in the end. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said miserably. &#x201c;I have no experience&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I would instruct you.&#x201d; Jones caught her hand. &#x201c;I do entreat you, Miss Johnson&#x201d;&#x2014;his grip tightened as his voice dropped&#x2014;&#x201c;to think on the great advantage it would do your future. To be able to say you had once served as housekeeper to His Grace. Why, no domestic of your age could dream of such a boon!&#x201d;<br> <br>Gently she pulled her hand free. He was right, of course. Had she truly been Olivia Johnson, parlor maid&#x2014;and not Olivia Holladay, former secretary, now operating under her second alias, with a falsified letter of reference&#x2014;she never would have refused the opportunity.<br> <br>And so, lest she rouse his suspicions, she said, &#x201c;It is a fine honor, indeed. But you must give me a day or two to think on it. To consult with myself, and see if I am worthy of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Olivia&#x2019;s humility pleased him. Smiling, he agreed to her terms.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s you.&#x201d; Mrs. Primm stepped aside, allowing Olivia to step into the shabby little hall.<br> <br>Mrs. Primm behaved as though she were doing her lodgers a ...</p><h2>Communities of Journalism: A History of American Newspapers and Their Readers (The History of Media and Communication)</h2><p>Illuminating how newspapers have intersected with religion, politics, reform, and urban life over nearly three centuries, Communities of Journalism is a contribution to the cultural history of American journalism and to the history of reading.</p><p><p>The significance of news and the institutions that produce it to American history</p><p></p><p></p><p>Widely acknowledged as one of our most insightful commentators on the history of journalism in the United States, David Paul Nord reveals how newspapers have intersected with religion, politics, reform, and urban life over nearly three centuries in a lively and wide-ranging discussion that shows journalism to be a vital component of community. In settings ranging from the religion-infused towns of colonial America to the rapidly expanding urban metropolises of the late nineteenth century, Nord explores the cultural work of the press and how ordinary readers use journalism to form community attachments and engage in civic life.</p>&#34;David Paul Nord is our most versatile historian of American journalism. In Communities of Journalism, he reads newspapers through their communities and brilliantly reads readers through their newspapers in ways original, accessible, and eye-opening.&#34; -- Michael Schudson, author of The Power of News &#34;These lucid essays are notably successful in connecting the history of journalism with social and cultural history; and when Nord turns to the history of reading, the data he has brought together and interpreted is of the highest importance.&#34; -- David D.

Walter Cohen, Wendy and Leonard Cooper; Rabbi Howard Gorin; Gittel and Alan Hilibrand; Marjorie and Jeffrey Major; Jeanette Lerman Neubauer and Joe Neubauer; Gayle and David Smith; and Harriet and Donald Young. <p>Ever since Abraham&#x2019;s famous argument with God, Judaism has been full of debate. Moses and Korah, David and Nathan, Hillel and Shammai, the Vilna Gaon and the Ba&#x2019;al Shem Tov, Spinoza and the Amsterdam Rabbis . . . the list goes on. Jews debate justice, authority, inclusion, spirituality, resistance, evolution, Zionism, and more. No wonder that Judaism cherishes the expression <i>machloket l&#x2019;shem shamayim</i>, &#x201c;an argument for the sake of heaven.&#x201d; </p>&nbsp;In this concise but important survey, Rabbi Barry L. Schwartz presents the provocative and vibrant thesis that debate and disputation are not only encouraged within Judaism but reside at the very heart of Jewish history and theology. In his graceful, engaging, and creative prose, Schwartz presents an introduction to an intellectual history of Judaism through the art of argumentation. <br>Beyond their historical importance, what makes these disputations so compelling is that nearly all of them, regardless of their epochs, are still being argued. Schwartz builds the case that the basis of Judaism is a series of unresolved rather than resolved arguments. <br>&nbsp;Drawing on primary sources, and with a bit of poetic license, Schwartz reconstructs the real or imagined dialogue of ten great debates and then analyzes their significance and legacy. This parade of characters spanning three millennia of biblical, rabbinic, and modern disputation reflects the panorama of Jewish history with its monumental political, ethical, and spiritual challenges.</p><p>Rabbi Barry L.

He travelled widely in most of Asia Minor, Egypt (as far as Assuan), North Africa, Syria, the country north of the Black Sea, and many parts of the Aegean Sea and the mainland of Greece. He lived, it seems, for some time in Athens, and in 443 went with other colonists to the new city Thurii (in South Italy), where he died about 430. He was 'the prose correlative of the bard, a narrator of the deeds of real men, and a describer of foreign places' (Murray).</p><p>Herodotus's famous history of warfare between the Greeks and the Persians has an epic dignity which enhances his delightful style. It includes the rise of the Persian power and an account of the Persian empire; a description and history of Egypt; and a long digression on the geography and customs of Scythia. Even in the later books on the attacks of the Persians against Greece there are digressions. All is most entertaining and produces a grand unity.

In an hour she and her friends would be back at Carnforth Hall with the other ministry teams that had spent the past week in various European countries. She wedged her hands between her crossed legs, trying to warm them against her jeans. Endless pastures, frosted with winter&#x2019;s ice, flashed past her window. Sierra let out a sigh.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you thinking?&#x201d; Katie asked, uncurling from her comfy position on the train seat next to Sierra. Katie&#x2019;s red hair swished as she tilted her head to make eye contact with Sierra. Even though Katie was two years older than Sierra and they had met only two weeks ago, they had become close during the week they had just spent together in Belfast, Northern Ireland.<br><br>&#x201c;About going back to the States,&#x201d; Sierra said. Her silver, dangling earrings chimed as she turned to Katie and smiled her wide, easy smile, but she was really looking past Katie. In the seat across the aisle from them, their team leader, Doug, was sitting next to his girlfriend, Tracy.<br><br>&#x201c;This whole trip went too fast.&#x201d; Katie folded her arms and settled back against the upholstered seat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not ready to go home yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Sierra agreed. &#x201c;Me neither.&#x201d; She noticed that Doug was now slipping his arm across the back of the seat. Tracy slid closer to him.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to come back,&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;Maybe next summer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; Sierra said, watching Tracy snuggle up to Doug.<br><br>&#x201c;It would be great if out whole team could be together again for another trip.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; Sierra said. Tracy was tilting her heartshaped faced toward Doug&#x2019;s, giving him a delicate smile that, by the look on his face, was melting him to the core.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean, &#x2018;me too&#x2019;? Of course you would be on the team.&#x201d; Katie looked over her shoulder to see what had distracted Sierra. Turning back to Sierra, Katie leaned forward and quietly said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t they just make you sick?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Katie,&#x201d; Sierra said in a hushed voice, &#x201c;I thought you guys were all best friends and had been for years&#x2013;you, Doug, Tracy, and Christy.

They&#x2019;re totally in love.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Sierra said, casting another quick glance at the couple who were now talking softly and looking deeply into each other&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine ever being in Tracy&#x2019;s place and having a guy look at me like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you kidding?&#x201d; Katie pulled back and let her bright green eyes do a quick head-to-toe scan of Sierra. &#x201c;Have you ever looked in a mirror, girl? First, you have the hair going for you. You have great hair! Wild, blond, curly. Very exotic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you noticed?&#x201d; Sierra said, tugging at a curly loop of her long hair. &#x201c;Straight, sleek hair happens to be in right now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh sure, this week. Wait a few days. Everyone will be running out for perms so they can look just like you. And your smile happens to be award-winning, in case you didn&#x2019;t know.

I&#x2019;m shaped like a tomboy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Better to be shaped like a tomboy than a fullback.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not shaped like a fullback,&#x201d; Sierra protested.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, a halfback.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re both beautiful,&#x201d; Stephen, the German guy on their team, inserted into the conversation. He was sitting directly across from them and had appeared to be sleeping.<br><br>Sierra felt her cheeks blush, realizing Stephen had overheard their conversation. He was the oldest one of their group, and his beard added to his older appearance.<br><br>&#x201c;Why do women find it a sport to criticize themselves to their friends?&#x201d; Stephen asked, leaning forward and taking on the tone of a counselor. &#x201c;You both are gorgeous young<br>women on the outside and fantastically beautiful here,&#x201d; he patted his heart, &#x201c;where it really counts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you tell us why all the guys aren&#x2019;t falling at our feet,&#x201d; Katie challenged.<br><br>&#x201c;Is that what you want?&#x201d; Stephen asked, and in an uncharacteristic move, tumbled to the floor and bowed at their feet.<br><br>Sierra burst out laughing.<br><br>&#x201c;Get out of here!&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re making this a joke, and I&#x2019;m serious.&#x201d;<br><br>Stephen returned to his seat, a satisfied little grin across his usually serious face.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a guy; tell us what you&#x2019;re attracted to in a girl,&#x201d; Katie said.<br><br>Stephen took a quick look at Tracy and then back at Sierra and Katie. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he began, but it was too late. His unspoken message seemed clear. Katie threw her hands up in the air. &#x201c;I knew it! You don&#x2019;t have to say anything. You men are all alike! You all <i>say </i>it&#x2019;s the personality and what&#x2019;s on the inside that counts. But the truth is your first choice every time is the Tracy-type, the sweet, helpful, cute ones. Admit it! There&#x2019;s little hope in this world for the few individualists like Sierra and me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On the contrary. You&#x2019;re both very attractive. To the right man, you will be a treasure. You just need to wait on God.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know,&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;And until then, we have our own little club, don&#x2019;t we, Sierra?&#x201d;<br><br>Sierra remembered when she and Katie had formed the Pals Only Club at the beginning of their trip. She slapped Katie a high five and said, &#x201c;P.O. forever!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;We may have lost Tracy, but it&#x2019;s you, me, and Christy from here on out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You women do not need a little club,&#x201d; Stephen said. &#x201c;Perhaps a caveman with a big club might be helpful...&#x201d;<br><br>Instead of laughing at his joke, the girls gave Stephen a tandem groan and twisted their expressions into unappreciative scowls. He folded his arms against his chest, closed<br>his eyes, and pretended to go back to sleep. But a crooked grin was on his lips.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get something to drink.&#x201d; <br><br>Sierra followed her down the rocking aisle that led to the back of the train car. They passed through the sliding doors and headed for the compact snack bar at the end of the next car. After buying Cokes, they stood to the side by the closed windows.<br><br>&#x201c;Guys like Stephen really bug me,&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;First they&#x2019;re all sweet and full of compliments, and then they make stupid jokes. You never know if they&#x2019;re serious about all the nice stuff or not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think he meant it,&#x201d; Sierra said, shifting her weight from one foot to another. She was wearing her favorite old cowboy boots that she had worn for most of the trip. They<br>were actually her dad&#x2019;s old leather boots. Very authentic. She had found them in the garage last summer when they were cleaning out stuff for a garage sale. Her mom had wanted to sell them and said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe we still have these old boots! Howard wore them on our first date.&#x201d;<br><br>That&#x2019;s when Sierra knew they couldn&#x2019;t be cast off to some stranger at a garage sale. She tried them on, and to her amazement, they fit. She had worn them constantly ever since, much to her mother&#x2019;s dismay.<br><br>&#x201c;Enough talk about guys,&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk about something else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be great to see all the other teams tonight and hear about everything that happened to them.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Katie agreed. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to hear about Christy&#x2019;s week in Spain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I still can&#x2019;t believe they pulled her off our team at the last minute and sent her all the way to Spain after the rest of the Spanish team had already left. I don&#x2019;t think I could have done what she did, traveling all by herself for two days and then joining up with a team of people she barely knew.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like I kept saying,&#x201d; Katie said, making a muscleman pose. &#x201c;She is Missionary Woman.&#x201d;<br><br>Sierra smiled. &#x201c;I felt as if I was just getting closer to her, and then they shipped her off on a moment&#x2019;s notice. It must have been even harder for you to see her leave like that, since you guys have been best friends for so long.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it was a God-thing.&#x201d; Katie finished her drink and tossed her can into the bin marked &#x201c;rubbish&#x201d; as if she were shooting a basketball into a hoop. She made the shot and with two fingers gave herself a score of &#x201c;two points&#x201d; in<br>the air.<br><br>Sierra finished her Coke and aimed her can at the rubbish bin. Her shot banked off the side. When she scooped it up, Katie said, &#x201c;Try it again.&#x201d; Sierra did. This time she made it.<br><br>&#x201c;All right!&#x201d; Katie said, slapping a low five behind her back. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re unstoppable.&#x201d;<br><br>Sierra thought about how much had happened during their week of ministry at the church in Belfast. Sierra and Katie had worked with the children, performed in a drama group, gone out street witnessing, prayed with teenagers when they said they wanted to give their lives to God, and had visited some elderly women of the church who treated them to tea and cakes. It had been a life-changing experience for Sierra, and she was glad Katie had buddied up with her.<br><br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Katie said, as they headed back to their seats, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure God had a reason for taking Christy off our team. If nothing else, it let me get to know you, and I&#x2019;m really glad for that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am too,&#x201d; said Sierra. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just starting to feel depressed now that it&#x2019;s almost over.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not so fast! We have two more days before we have to leave,&#x201d; Katie pointed out.<br><br>&#x201c;Next stop is ours,&#x201d; Stephen said when they reached their seats. &#x201c;Hey, Doug, we&#x2019;re almost there. Next stop.&#x201d;<br><br>Sierra watched as Tracy uncurled herself from Doug&#x2019;s shoulder and Doug resumed his role as team leader. He was a great guy. Sierra admired him, especially after all they had<br>experienced together as a team this past week. She could easily see Doug and Tracy married and working together in ministry.<br><br>The group members gathered their belongings, as they had done dozens of times during their travels, and helped with each other&#x2019;s luggage. It was a familiar routine.<br><br>Sierra fought off the sadness that crept in when she realized the next time she boarded a train in England it would be to go home. Something caught in her throat every time she thought about returning to the States.<br><br>She hadn&#x2019;t been able to talk about it to Katie or anyone else. Maybe she should. Whenever she mentioned her situation, it had been with her usually cheerful, adventuresome spirit. No one knew that deep down she was nervous, knowing that everything in her life was going to be different when she returned home.<br><br>While Sierra was in England, her family had moved. Instead of flying back to the small mountain community in northern California where she had spent her life, she was<br>flying to Portland, Oregon, her new home. The train came to a stop, and the group shuffled off and made its way through the station and then out to the small parking lot in front. A van was waiting for them in the late afternoon drizzle. They climbed in like a bunch of<br>robots, all so accustomed to travel and so tired from their latest adventure.<br><br>Sierra sat in the back next to the window, curling and uncurling her cold toes inside the leather cowboy boots. She still had two more days in England, two more days to think through all the changes that were about to take place in her life. She wasn&#x2019;t ready for any of it. The nervousness about the move bothered her. Sierra had always been the bold, free-spirited type. But then, her whole foundation of home and family had never been rocked before.<br><br>Tracy slid into the van and plopped down next to Sierra. Doug sat in the front and patted the driver on the shoulder, thanking him for the ride.<br><br>Tracy said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to see Christy! I hope she had a good time in Spain.&#x201d;<br><br>Sierra smiled and nodded in agreement. She couldn&#x2019;t help but like Tracy. Everyone did. And of course Sierra was happy for Tracy that she and Doug had gotten together on the trip. Still, something made Sierra feel a little hurt and left out. Maybe it was jealousy that Tracy was getting one of the few truly wonderful guys left in the world.<br><br>The van wound around the narrow streets through the small town and then hit the country road leading to Carnforth Hall. The scenery looked exactly as it had a week ago when they left, with the exception of a few wild, purple crocuses popping up through patches of thawed earth. Sierra decided that if any more guys like Doug existed in this world, they certainly weren&#x2019;t in Pineville, Sierra&#x2019;s old hometown. And they certainly weren&#x2019;t on this trip.<br><br>&#x201c;Tracy, by any chance does Doug have any brothers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does Doug have any brothers?&#x201d; Tracy repeated with a skeptical look. &#x201c;Why do you ask?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, no reason. Never mind.&#x201d;<br><br>The van stopped in the gravel driveway at the front of an old castle, Carnforth Hall. Standing in front of the huge wooden doors was a tall brunette under an open umbrella.<br>She waved wildly at their van.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Christy!&#x201d; Katie shouted, standing up in the back of the van and pounding on the closed window. &#x201c;Hey, Missionary Woman!&#x201d;<br><br>Sierra watched as Christy struck a muscle-bound pose with her right arm. Something on her wrist caught the glow of the amber porch light and sparkled brightly.</p><h2>Milestones: Memoirs: 1927 - 1977</h2><p><p></p><p>Rich in humor and culture, as well as passion and love for the cause of God and of man,&nbsp;<i>Milestones</i>&nbsp;is the early autobiography of Pope Benedict XVI, Joseph Ratzinger.

How easy was it to know what was actually going on, to grasp the essence of National Socialism, to remain untouched by the propaganda, or predict the Holocaust?</p><p><em>Travelers in the Third Reich</em> is an extraordinary history of the rise of the Nazis based on fascinating first-hand accounts, drawing together a multitude of voices and stories, including politicians, musicians, diplomats, schoolchildren, communists, scholars, athletes, poets, fascists, artists, tourists, and even celebrities like Charles Lindbergh and Samuel Beckett. Their experiences create a remarkable three-dimensional picture of Germany under Hitler&#x2015;one so palpable that the reader will feel, hear, even breathe the atmosphere.</p><p>These are the accidental eyewitnesses to history.

Previously a trustee of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, she now lives in London.&#x201c;While there have been countless books written about the rise of Hitler, <em>Travelers in the Third Reich</em> relies on firsthand accounts by foreigners to convey what it was really like to visit, study or vacation in Germany during the 1920s and &#x2019;30s. As Julia Boyd emphasizes, too many people allowed reverence for a nation&#x2019;s glorious past to warp their judgment about its morally repugnant present. That&#x2019;s a lesson still worth thinking about.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Dirda, <em>The Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Conveys how challenging it must have been to forecast the dimensions of the impending tragedy. Boyd notes that, in 1936, even so astute and well-intentioned an observer as the African-American educator W.E. B. DuBois &#x2015; who should have been particularly attuned to race-baiting and prejudice &#x2015; stopped short of demonizing the regime. Instead, in common with the European political leaders who failed to arrest Hitler&#x2019;s momentum, he temporized. &#x2018;It is extremely difficult,&#x2019; he wrote, &#x2018;to express an opinion about Germany today which is true in all respects without numerous modifications and explanations.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Boston Globe</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Far fewer travelers were free to move about the country during those years, and the accounts they left behind are, as Boyd puts it, &#x2018;both horrifying and touching.&#x2019; Those terms apply intensely to the whole of <em>Travelers in the Third Reich</em>, and readers will likely share Boyd's quiet outrage that more Germans didn't see &#x2013; or weren't willing to admit &#x2013; what was happening right in front of their eyes.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This fresh, surprising perspective on how Nazi Germany was seen at the time will appeal to anyone looking for a new angle on that historical moment.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A well-conceived study of a little-known corner of history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Boyd's fresh and instructive look at 1930s Germany as described in contemporaneous travel narratives reveals a tourist destination that continued to attract visitors even as the true intentions of the Nazis became obvious.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Extraordinary and absorbing. These firsthand glimpses of a dark time in Germany show us the complexity of appearances, and Boyd&#x2019;s book should be widely read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>BookPage</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A compelling historical narrative.

Conceived by some of the most influential art historians of our time, this extraordinary book has now been revised, expanded and brought right up to date to include the latest developments in the study and practice of art. With a clear year-by-year structure, the authors present 130 articles, each focusing on a crucial event - such as the creation of a seminal work, the publication of an important text, or the opening of a major exhibition - to tell the myriad stories of art from 1900 to the present. All the key turning-points and breakthroughs of modernism and postmodernism are explored in depth, as are the frequent antimodernist reactions that proposed alternative visions. This expanded edition includes a new introduction on the impact of globalization, as well as essays on the development of Synthetic Cubism, early avant-garde film, Brazilian modernism, postmodern architecture, Moscow conceptualism, queer art, South African photography, and the rise of the new museum of art. Acclaimed as the definitive work on the subject, Art Since 1900 is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of art in the modern age.<br></p><p></p><h2>Rainbow Magic: The Ultimate Fairy Guide</h2><p>The ultimate must-have for any fairy fan: a full color guide to your favorite Rainbow Magic fairies!<br><br>The guide that fairy fans have been waiting for is finally here!

Two eccentrics, Richard Dana and Octavia Dockery&#x2014;known in the press as the "Wild Man" and the "Goat Woman"&#x2014;enlisted an African American man named George Pearls to rob their reclusive neighbor, Jennie Merrill, at her estate. During the attempted robbery, Merrill was shot and killed. The crime drew national coverage when it came to light that Dana and Dockery, the alleged murderers, shared their huge, decaying antebellum mansion with their goats and other livestock, which prompted journalists to call the estate "Goat Castle." Pearls was killed by an Arkansas policeman in an unrelated incident before he could face trial. However, as was all too typical in the Jim Crow South, the white community demanded "justice," and an innocent black woman named Emily Burns was ultimately sent to prison for the murder of Merrill. Dana and Dockery not only avoided punishment but also lived to profit from the notoriety of the murder by opening their derelict home to tourists.<br><br>Strange, fascinating, and sobering, Goat Castle tells the story of this local feud, killing, investigation, and trial, showing how a true crime tale of fallen southern grandeur and murder obscured an all too familiar story of racial injustice.<br><br></p><p>Karen L. Cox is professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.Karen Cox masterfully demonstrates through a close look at the murder of Jennie Merrill how the sentimental rewriting of Civil War&#x2013;era history did far more than engulf southern white culture in a romantic haze of ancestor worship; it was used as justification for racial segregation, lynching, and a legal system that routinely denied people of color justice under the law. This story will enrage readers while bringing tears to their eyes.--Victoria E. Bynum, author of <i>The Free State of Jones</i><br>Riveting and beautifully written, this book richly enhances our understanding of southern culture, slavery, gender, and Jim Crow. By revisiting the Goat Castle murder, Cox places the history of black and white Natchez in context, emphasizing the social and economic variables that shaped people's everyday lives while remaining especially attentive to the cultural milieu that framed their lived experiences.--Talitha LeFlouria, author of <i>Chained in Silence</i><br>In taut and riveting prose, historian Karen Cox has written a masterful and moving account of murder and racial injustice in the heart of the Deep South at the height of the Great Depression. Taking readers into the crumbling mansions of Natchez, Mississippi, where white southerners still clung to any vestige of the privileges they once enjoyed, Cox reopens a decades-old mystery, and, thanks to her herculean efforts to rescue what really happened, some ugly wrongs finally have been righted.--Heather Ann Thompson, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>Blood in the Water</i><br><i>Goat Castle</i> is a highly entertaining story about a long-forgotten murder. It is also a reminder of the racism and intolerance found in southern history and of how difficult change has been. It's a terrific read.--John Grisham<br>With masterful storytelling, first-rate research, and an ability to see what is often unseen, Karen Cox uses the 1932 'Goat Castle' murder in Natchez, Mississippi, to reveal the myths, meanings, and mysteries behind Americans' fascination with the Old South.

Extremism has grown exponentially as Muslims and non-Muslims alike continue to be victims of global terrorism. Terrorist attacks have occurred from Morocco to Indonesia and from Madrid to London, as U.S.-led wars rage in Iraq and Afghanistan. As of this writing, war and terrorism have already claimed more than 300,000 lives since 9/11; the vast majority have been civilians.<br> <br>As we face savage actions in a world that seems ever more dangerous and out of control, we are confronted daily by analysis from terrorism experts and pundits who see the religion of Islam as responsible for global terrorism. At the same time, terrorist groups like al-Qaeda beam messages throughout the world that demonize the West as the enemy of Islam, responsible for all the ills of the Muslim world.<br> <br>Amid the rhetoric of hate and growing violence, both anti-Americanism in the Muslim world and Islamophobia &#x2014; discrimination against or hostility toward Islam or Muslims &#x2014; have increased precipitously. In the aftermath of 9/11, President George W. Bush emphasized that America was waging war against global terrorism, not against Islam. However, the continued acts of a terrorist minority, coupled with statements by preachers of hate (Muslim and Christian) as well as anti-Muslim talk show hosts and political commentators have inflamed our emotions and distorted our views. The religion of Islam and the mainstream Muslim majority have been conflated with the beliefs and actions of an extremist minority. The result was reflected in a USA Today/Gallup poll, which found substantial minorities of Americans admitting to negative feelings or prejudice against Muslims and favoring heightened security measures with Muslims to help prevent terrorism. Nearly one-quarter of Americans, 22%, say they would not want a Muslim as a neighbor; fewer than half believe U.S. Muslims are loyal to the United States; and 44% say Muslims are too extreme in their religious beliefs.<br> <br>Are the growing violence and negative perceptions on all sides only a prelude to an inevitable all-out war between the West and 1.3 billion Muslims?<br> <br>The vital missing piece among the many voices weighing in on this question is the actual views of Muslim publics. With all that is at stake for U.S. and Muslim societies, indeed for the future of the world, the time has come to democratize the debate.<br> <br><i>Who Speaks for Islam? Listening to the Voices of a Billion Muslims</i> is about this silenced majority. It is the product of a mammoth Gallup research study over the last six years. Gallup conducted tens of thousands of face-to-face interviews with residents of more than 35 predominantly Muslim nations. Gallup&#x2019;s sample represents urban and rural, young and old, educated and illiterate, women and men. In total, we surveyed a sample representing over 90% of the world&#x2019;s 1.3 billion Muslims, including Muslims in the West, making this the largest, most comprehensive study of contemporary Muslims ever.<br> <br>The concept of this book is simple. After collecting vast amounts of data representing the views of the world&#x2019;s Muslims, we asked the questions everyone wants answers to: What is at the root of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world? Who are the extremists? Is democracy a desired construct among Muslims, and if so, what might it look like? What do Muslim women really want? With questions in hand, we let the empirical evidence &#x2014; the voices of a billion Muslims, not individual &#x201c;experts&#x201d; or &#x201c;extremists,&#x201d; dictate the answer.</p><p>In the wake of the terrorist attacks on 9/11, U.S. public officials seemed to have no idea whether or not many Muslims supported the bombings. This troubled Gallup Chairman and CEO Jim Clifton, who felt that "no one in Washington had any idea what 1.3 billion Muslims were thinking, and yet we were working on intricate strategies that were going to change the world for all time." Clifton commissioned his company to undertake the enormous job. <p> The result is Who Speaks for Islam? What a Billion Muslims Really Think, based on six years of research and more than 50,000 interviews representing 1.3 billion Muslims who reside in more than 35 nations that are predominantly Muslim or have sizable Muslim populations. Representing more than 90% of the world's Muslim community, it makes this poll the largest, most comprehensive study of its kind. </p><p> What the data reveal and the authors illuminate may surprise you: </p><p> * Muslims and Americans are equally likely to reject attacks on civilians as morally unjustifiable.<br> * Large majorities of Muslims would guarantee free speech if it were up to them to write a new constitution AND they say religious leaders should have no direct role in drafting that constitution.<br> * Muslims around the world say that what they LEAST admire about the West is its perceived moral decay and breakdown of traditional values -- the same answers that Americans themselves give when asked this question.<br> * When asked about their dreams for the future, Muslims say they want better jobs and security, not conflict and violence.<br> * Muslims say the most important thing Westerners can do to improve relations with their societies is to change their negative views toward Muslims and respect Islam.<br> </p><p> The research suggests that conflict between Muslims and the West is NOT inevitable and, in fact, is more about policy than principles. "However," caution Esposito and Mogahed, "until and unless decision makers listen directly to the people and gain an accurate understanding of this conflict, extremists on all sides will continue to gain ground." </p><p> Who Speaks for Islam? is an important book that challenges conventional wisdom and sheds greater light on what motivates Muslims worldwide. It is a must-read for anyone committed to creating peace and security in our lifetime.</p>"In these fraught days of heightened tension and increasing hostility, few books could be more timely." <br>--Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize winner <p> "As our world spirals out of control with greater violence and misunderstanding between the West and the Muslim world, Who Speaks for Islam? cuts through the conflicting rhetoric of politicians and pundits and presents the often-silenced voice of Muslims everywhere. I cannot imagine a more important or more badly needed intervention." <br>--Deepak Chopra, author of Peace is the Way </p><p> "The data presented in this book are not only arresting, but indispensable. Who Speaks for Islam? should be required reading for policy makers, journalists, broadcasters, teachers, students, and scholars." <br>--Karen Armstrong, author of A History of God </p><p> "At once incisive and provocative, this book is brimming with valuable insights into what Muslims think about religion, democracy, women's rights, extremism, and Muslims' relations with the West. This is a must-read for pundits and policy makers, specialists and non-specialists, American or Muslim." <br>--Vali Nasr, author of The Shia Revival: How Conflicts Within Islam Will Shape the Future </p><p> "Who Speaks for Islam? teaches us about one of the most important issues of our time. The book contains many surprises about how Westerners and Muslims view one another." <br>--Jessica Stern, author of Terror in the Name of God and Academic Director of the Program on Terrorism and the Law at Harvard Law School </p><p> "This is an important book. Years after 9/11, politics and quick judgments continue to stand in the way of a clear-eyed view of the Muslim world. Not so for Esposito and Mogahed. They provide powerful evidence and compelling logic that shows Muslims around the world have many of the same hopes and dreams, and face many of the same issues and concerns, as other people do." <br>--Robert Pape, author of Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism and Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago </p><p> "Who Speaks for Islam? could not be more timely. It provides essential insights into the thinking and attitudes of a large part of the global Muslim population on critical issues such as democracy, theocracy, extremism, jihad, women's rights, and the prospects of cooperation or conflict between the West and the Muslim world." <br>--Ambassador Edward P. Djerejian, former assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs; founding director, James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University</p></p><h2>Nijmegen: U.

Two leading evangelical thinkers in church history and philosophy summarize the major points of contention between Protestants and Catholics, honestly acknowledging real differences while conveying mutual respect and charity. The authors address key historical, theological, and philosophical issues as they consider what remains at stake five hundred years after the Reformation. They also present a hopeful way forward for future ecumenical relations, showing how Protestants and Catholics can participate in a common witness to the world.</p><p><b>A Critique of Roman Catholicism in Defense of the Catholic Faith<br></b><br>"Collins and Walls make a vigorous case for why Rome should <i>not </i>insist on being the exclusive center of the catholic church. Roman centricity deconstructs true catholicity by suggesting that Orthodox and Protestant churches are deficient; it similarly undermines canonicity (i.e., biblical authority) insofar as <i>sola scriptura </i>is virtually displaced by <i>sola Roma</i>. Collins and Walls remind us that what continues to divide Christians 500 years after the Reformation are not simply disagreements over doctrine or the authority and interpretation of Scripture, but differences over the nature of the church and the meaning of catholicity."<br>--<b>Kevin&nbsp;J. Vanhoozer</b>, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br> <br>"For decades, there has been a spirited polemic against Protestantism that sought intellectual solace and resolution in converting to Rome. It was only a matter of time before somebody, somewhere, would challenge this whole operation. Collins and Walls have done so in a way that lowers the temperature but does not shirk the full range of issues at stake. The claims of the Roman church are subject to searching examination in an irenic yet candid assessment. No doubt the debate will continue; we can only hope that the tone and content will be better as a result of their efforts."<br>--<b>William&nbsp;J. Abraham</b>, Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University<br><br>"The thesis of <i>Roman but Not Catholic</i> is that 'the Church of Rome is not sufficiently catholic,' and Collins and Walls support that admittedly ironic claim irenically but stringently. This is a book every Protestant who feels some pull toward Rome must read before converting. It should also be read by every Protestant who knows a fellow Protestant moving toward Rome."<br>--<b>Roger&nbsp;E. Olson</b>, George&nbsp;W. Truett Theological Seminary, Baylor University<br><br>"The 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation has spawned a number of attempts to explain why it happened and why it still matters. Collins and Walls paint a picture of Catholicism that is broader and more authentically traditional than the one professed by the Roman church. They do so with both clarity and charity and demonstrate that evangelical Protestantism has a strong claim to be&nbsp;the truest&nbsp;expression today of the faith once delivered to the saints."<br>--<b>Gerald Bray</b>, Beeson Divinity School, Samford University<b>Kenneth J. Collins</b> (PhD, Drew University) is professor of historical theology and Wesley studies at Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky.<br><br><b>Jerry L.

November, 1565: Master ninja Hiro Hattori and Portuguese Jesuit Father Mateo travel to a Buddhist temple at the summit of Mount Koya, carrying a secret message for an Iga spy posing as a priest on the sacred mountain. When a snowstorm strikes the peak, a killer begins murdering the temple&#39;s priests and posing them as Buddhist judges of the afterlife--the Kings of Hell. Hiro and Father Mateo must unravel the mystery before the remaining priests--including Father Mateo--become unwilling members of the killer&#39;s grisly council of the dead.</p><p>Susan Spann is the 2015 Rocky Mountain Fiction Writers&#39; Writer of the Year and the author of five novels in the Shinobi Mystery series: Claws of the Cat, Blade of the Samurai, Flask of the Drunken Master, The Ninja&#39;s Daughter, and Betrayal at Iga.

Believe me, she does the great Dame Agatha proud. This excellent entry in Spann&#x2019;s series of Hiro Hattori mysteries offers plenty of esoteric clues and red herrings that are fun to chase. Along the way, she even does Christie one better, giving readers a fascinating glimpse of life and religion in feudal Japan. This is a book sure to please Spann&#x2019;s growing legion of fans as well as anyone who loves the work of Agatha Christie.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;William Kent Krueger, Edgar� Award&#x2013;winning author of<i> Sulfur Springs<br></i><br>&#x201c;Spann writes with careful attention to dialogue and setting.

Fans of this series, and of similar series set in medieval Japan by Laura Joh Rowland and I. J.

Hassrick here attempts to describe the ways of the people, the patterns of their behavior, and the concepts of their imagination. Uniquely, he has approached the subject from the Sioux's own point of view, giving their own interpretation of their world in the era of its greatest vigor and renown &#x2013;the brief span of years from about 1830 to 1870.</p><p>In addition to printed sources, the author has drawn from the observation and records of a number of Sioux who were still living when this book was projected, and were anxious to serve as links to the vanished world of their forebears.</p><p>Because it is true that men become in great measure what they think and want themselves to be, it is important to gain this insight into Sioux thought of a century ago. Apparently, the most significant theme in their universe was that man was a minute but integral part of that universe. The dual themes of self-expression and self-denial reached through their lives, helping to explain their utter defeat soon after the Battle of the Little Big Horn.

Besides the staffing, organization and development of troops, the book gives detailed account of uniforms, weapons and other materiel (both conventional and unusual). Training is described using drill manuals and tactical instructions of the period, and fighting methods actually performed on the battlefield are described - based on firsthand accounts and period observations from Russian, Swedish and impartial sources. Pitched battles that often predominate in descriptions of early-18th century warfare are given their due in the book; however, linear tactics on the field were not the only - nor even the main - type of actions during the Great Northern War, so the author goes into details of the sieges, small war actions and riverine, lake and naval combats. <br><br>The author brings up materials that were unavailable to English-speaking readers and scholars so far, and the book not only contains the author&#x2019;s own research, but is also based on the most recent works of other Russian scholars who specialize in various aspects of the Petrine military history; this makes the book a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of Peter the Great&#x2019;s military force during the Great Northern War (1700-1721). The book is supplemented with numerous contemporary prints and paintings, photos of artifacts and recreated uniform kits, as well as specially commissioned artwork that has been created by an artist who is knowledgeable in details from that period.</p><p>Boris Megorsky born in Leningrad, USSR, in 1978.

What of a lighter, for example, or a telephone? The essays in this new collection examine just that. The contributors pose not only a historical, pragmatic use for the items, but also delve into more imaginative aspects of what defines us as Americans. Both the lighter and the telephone are investigated, as well as how the lava lamp represents sixties counterculture and containment. The late nineteenth-century corset is discussed as an embodiment of womanhood, and an Amish quilt is used as an illustration of cultural continuity. These are just a few of the artifacts discussed. Scholars will be intrigued by the historical interpretations that contributors proposed concerning a teapot, card table, and locket; students will not only find merit in the expositions, but also by learning from the models how such interpretation can be carried out.

Auel&#39;s epic of life 35,000 years ago when two kinds of human beings, Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon, shared the Earth. It follows the story of Ayla, a young girl who is adopted by a group of Neanderthal.</p><p>When her parents are killed by an earthquake, 5-year-old Ayla wanders through the forest completely alone. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, the little girl is as good as gone until she is discovered by a group who call themselves the Clan of the Cave Bear. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, have little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the "Others." Only their medicine woman sees in Ayla a fellow human, worthy of care. She painstakingly nurses her back to health--a decision that will forever alter the physical and emotional structure of the clan. Although this story takes place roughly 35,000 years ago, its cast of characters could easily slide into any modern tale. The members of the Neanderthal clan, ruled by traditions and taboos, find themselves challenged by this outsider, who represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.<p> Although Jean Auel obviously takes certain liberties with the actions and motivations of all our ancestors, her extensive research into the Ice Age does shine through--especially in the detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla. Mostly, though, this first in the series of four is a wonderful story of survival. Ayla's personal evolution is a compelling and relevant tale. <i>--Sara Nickerson</i></p>The stunning epic that stirred the imagination of millions. Here is a novel of awesome beauty and power. A moving saga about people, relationships and the boundaries of love. Through Jean Auel&#39;s magnificent storytelling, we are taken back to the dawn of mankind and swept up in the wonderful world of a very special heroine, Ayla. Her enthralling story is one we all can share. A natural disaster has left young Ayla alone, wandering, fending for herself in an unfamiliar land. One day, she is discovered by the Clan of the Cave bear, men and women far different from her own people. Tall, blond, blue-eyed Ayla is a mysterious stranger to the Clan and at first they mistrust her and cast her out. But as she grows to know them and to learn the ways of the Clan, she is welcomed. And as she leads them in their struggle for survival, the Clan come to worship Ayla. For in her blood flows the future of humanity.</p><h2>The Revelation of St. John Divine: Commentary on the English Text</h2><p>Austin Farrer was, by common consent, one of the most remarkable men of his generation.

Rodrigue, who began painting in the third grade while bedridden with polio, had already won local acclaim for his rich portrayals of the landscape and people he grew up with when Blue Dog transformed the image of the original Cajun werewolf dog the loup-garou into an international pop icon. This long-overdue retrospective features 265 paintings spanning Rodrigue&#39;s 40-year career. With a text by art historian and former ARTnews correspondent Ginger Danto, this is the first outside view and analysis of Rodrigue&#39;s paintings in book form. It covers all the distinct phases of his work, showing his development as an artist as his subjects shifted from majestic oak trees to Cajun fishermen and local politicians to the incomparable Blue Dog, whose mesmerizing expression and haunting eyes have captured the hearts of U.S. presidents, Hollywood stars, and ordinary people alike.</p><p>Ginger Danto has lived in Paris for the last 15 years, where she wrote about the arts for ARTnews, the New York Times, the International Herald Tribune, the Village Voice, Dance Magazine, and Art and Antiques.

Will anarchism remain a revolutionary social movement or become a chic boutique lifestyle subculture? Will its primary goals be the complete transformation of a hierarchical, class, and irrational society into a libertarian communist one? Or will it become an ideology focused on personal well-being, spiritual redemption, and self-realization within the existing society?<br>In an era of privatism, kicks, introversion, and post-modernist nihilism, Murray Bookchin forcefully examines the growing nihilistic trends that threaten to undermine the revolutionary tradition of anarchism and co-opt its fragments into a harmless personalistic, yuppie ideology of social accommodation that presents no threat to the existing powers that be. Includes the essay, "The Left That Was."<br></p><p>Murray Bookchin is cofounder of the Institute for Social Ecology. An active voice in the ecology and anarchist movements for more than forty years, he has written numerous books and articles, including: Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left, Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism, The Spanish Anarchists, The Ecology of Freedom, Urbanization Without Cities, and Re-enchanting Humanity.

On each side of him there extended a soft shadow, like a wing of wondrous breadth and length. Before him, at the foot of the mountain, stood an image full of eyes on all sides, in which, because of those eyes, I could discern no human form.�-Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179) </p> <p> Hildegard of Bingen was widely consulted as an oracle and prophet and wrote prolifically on doctrinal matters, as well as on secular matters like medicine. Scivias, her major religious work, consists of twenty-six visions, which are first set down literally as she saw them, and are then explained exegetically. As a group the visions form a theological summa of Christian doctrine and are famous for their feminine and creative imagery of the divine. This volume is especially significant for feminist historians and theologians. It elucidates the life of medieval women, and is a striking example of a special form of Christian spirituality. </p></p><p></p><h2>Gestures</h2><p><p><br>Throughout his career, the influential new media theorist Vil�m Flusser kept the idea of gesture in mind: that people express their being in the world through a sweeping range of movements. He reconsiders familiar actions&#x2014;from speaking and painting to smoking and telephoning&#x2014;in terms of particular movement, opening a surprising new perspective on the ways we share and preserve meaning. A gesture may or may not be linked to specialized apparatus, though its form crucially affects the person who makes it.</p><p>These essays, published here as a collection in English for the first time, were written over roughly a half century and reflect both an eclectic array of interests and a durable commitment to phenomenological thought. Defining gesture as &#x201c;a movement of the body or of a tool attached to the body for which there is no satisfactory causal explanation,&#x201d; Flusser moves around the topic from diverse points of view, angles, and distances: at times he zooms in on a modest, ordinary movement such as taking a photograph, shaving, or listening to music; at others, he pulls back to look at something as vast and varied as human &#x201c;making,&#x201d; embracing everything from the fashioning of simple tools to mass manufacturing. But whatever the gesture, Flusser analyzes it as the expression of a particular form of consciousness, that is, as a particular relationship between the world and the one who gestures. <br></p></p><p><p><br>Vil�m Flusser (1920&#x2013;1991) was born in Prague; emigrated to Brazil, where he taught philosophy and wrote a daily newspaper column; and later moved to France. Among his many books that have been translated into English are <i>Does Writing Have a Future?</i>, <i>Into the Universe of Technical Images</i>, and <i>Writings</i>, all from Minnesota.<br>Nancy Ann Roth is an arts writer and critic based in the UK. She previously translated <i>Does Writing Have a Future?</i> and <i>Into the Universe of Technical Images</i>.</p><p>"Flusser transforms gesture to the level of metaphor, offering deep, sometimes metaphysical, interpretation of the human condition.&nbsp; Though it resists being put in a particular disciplinary niche, <i>Gestures </i>will surely become a standard for the many scholars who have already debated or acknowledged the value of Flusser&#x2019;s claims."&#x2014;<i>CHOICE</i></p><p>"Flusser&#x2019;s book transcends the time in which it was written."&#x2014;<i>International Journal of Communication</i></p><p>"Flusser's writings have a more accessible style, offering precise examples and analogies to specify key concepts. For this reason, the work of Flusser, especially <i>Gestures</i>, eclectically engages with deconstructive paradigms of philosophy at a level accessible to undergraduate students and academics."&#x2014;<i>Screen Bodies</i></p></p><h2>Missing Measures: Modern Poetry and the Revolt Against Meter</h2><p>Examines the departure from meter and rhyme in modern poetry and the increased use of free verse</p><p>Valerie Steele is a Curator at The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, and editor of the journal "Fashion Theory." Her previous books include "Women of Fashion"(Rizzoli, 1991) and "Fetish: Fashion, Sex and Power." <br>Free verse, contends poet Steele, has become a sort of Frankenstein's monster: the instigators of the modern, nonmetrical revolution in poetry expected free verse to be a "temporary expedient," a salutary but transient antidote to the florid idiom of late Victorian poetry. Instead, "having claimed special liberties for themselves, they found it difficult to persuade their followers to adopt a more restrained approach," and free verse has been the poetic orthodoxy for over a century. From Aristotle to Eliot, Steele surveys in a forthright and limpid style the history of the distinction between poetry and prose. He shows how the Modernists misconstrued the dicta of earlier poetic revolutionaries, identified Victorian diction with meter, and deposed them simultaneously. This is a judicious and intelligent appeal for a revival of metrical verse.<br><i>- Jeffrey R.

Illustrated by Philippe Ames.</p><h2>Actress: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>A brilliant and moving novel about celebrity, sexual power, and a daughter&#x2019;s search to understand her mother&#x2019;s hidden truths.</strong></p><p>Katherine O&#x2019;Dell is an Irish theater legend. As her daughter, Norah, retraces her mother&#x2019;s celebrated career and bohemian life, she delves into long-kept secrets, both her mother&#x2019;s and her own. Katherine began her career on Ireland&#x2019;s bus-and-truck circuit before making it to London&#x2019;s West End, Broadway, and finally Hollywood. Every moment of her life is a performance, with young Norah standing in the wings. But the mother-daughter romance cannot survive Katherine&#x2019;s past or the world&#x2019;s damage. With age, alcohol, and dimming stardom, Katherine&#x2019;s grip on reality grows fitful. Fueled by a proud and long-simmering rage, she commits a bizarre crime.</p><p>As Norah&#x2019;s role gradually changes to Katherine&#x2019;s protector, caregiver, and finally legacy-keeper, she revisits her mother&#x2019;s life of fiercely kept secrets; and Norah reveals in turn the secrets of her own sexual and emotional coming-of-age story. Her narrative is shaped by three braided searches&#x2015;for her father&#x2019;s identity; for her mother&#x2019;s motive in donning a Chanel suit one morning and shooting a TV producer in the foot; and her own search for a husband, family, and work she loves.</p><p>Bringing to life two generations of women with difficult sexual histories, both assaulted and silenced, both finding&#x2015;or failing to find&#x2015;their powers of recovery, <em>Actress</em> touches a raw and timely nerve. With virtuosic storytelling and in prose at turns lyrical and knife-sharp, Enright takes readers to the heart of the maddening yet tender love that binds a mother and daughter.</p></p><p><p><strong>Praise for Anne Enright:</strong></p><p>"With Anne Enright, we are always in the country of the first-rate.

His popular Honor Harrington space-opera adventures are &#34;New York Times&#34; bestsellers and can&#39;t come out fast enough for his devoted readers. Weber and his wife Sharon live in South Carolina.Naval SF is the common theme in this solid collection consisting of a short novel, Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington, and three stories, all set in the same universe that Weber (Ashes of Victory) created for his popular series heroine, Honor Harrington. In the novel, Honor is now a midshipman in the Royal Manticoran navy (which sails space, not the sea) on her "snotty" cruise. This trip will determine whether Honor will keep her commission or flunk out of the naval academy as a complete failure. Along for the ride is her constant companion, Nimitz, a tree cat who has bonded with Honor and now is able to share emotions and some empathic ability. Unfortunately, someone who has a grudge against Honor has manipulated the crew roster to include Elvis Santino as her training officer. Besides having the power to ax Honor's career without moving a muscle, Mr. Santino has a real problem with people who are smarter than he is and that definitely includes Ms. Harrington. The outlook for Honor is bleak, to say the least. Like the novel, the three stand-alone stories, which are only lighted connected to Honor, have the flavor of C.S. Forester's Hornblower books. Readers familiar with David Feintuch's Hope series will also see similarities. Weber gives a real feel for the military chain of command both the good and bad parts. While some fans may be disappointed because the novel and stories don't interlock, the individual works have more than enough suspenseful action to engross the reader.

Hoping to marry, she chose to remain in the Nazi-run state even as the last Americans departed for home. In 1940, she was hired by the German overseas radio, where she evolved from a simple disc jockey and announcer to a master propagandist. Under the tutelage of her married lover, Max Otto Koischwitz, Gillars became the personification of Nazi propaganda to the American GI.<br><br>Spicing her broadcasts with music, Mildred used her soothing voice to taunt Allied troops about the supposed infidelities of their wives and girlfriends back home, as well as the horrible deaths they were likely to meet on the battlefield. Supported by German military intelligence, she was able to convey personal greetings to individual US units, creating an eerie foreboding among troops who realized the Germans knew who and where they were.<br><br>After broadcasting for Berlin up to the very end of the war, Gillars tried but failed to pose as a refugee, but was captured by US authorities. Her 1949 trial for treason captured the attention and raw emotion of a nation fresh from the horrors of the Second World War.

The story has the same sense of epic vastness despite happening mostly in one isolated solar system. Here there's a world of intelligent spider creatures who traditionally hibernate through the "Deepest Darkness" of their strange variable sun's long "off" periods, when even the atmosphere freezes. Now, science offers them an alternative... Meanwhile, attracted by spider radio transmissions, two human starfleets come exploring--merchants hoping for customers and tyrants who want slaves. Their inevitable clash leaves both fleets crippled, with the power in the wrong hands, which leads to a long wait in space until the spiders develop exploitable technology. Over the years Vinge builds palpable tension through multiple storylines and characters. In the sky, hopes of rebellion against tyranny continue despite soothing lies, brutal repression, and a mental bondage that can convert people into literal tools. Down below, the engagingly sympathetic spiders have their own problems. In flashback, we see the grandiose ideals and ultimate betrayal of the merchant culture's founder, now among the human contingent and pretending to be a senile buffoon while plotting, plotting... Major revelations, ironies, and payoffs follow. A powerful story in the grandest SF tradition. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i>"Vinge has done it again. <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i> is vivid, suspenseful, [and] realistic. Vinge's villains are chillingly believable, and so is his vision of a hopeful tomorrow." --David Brin<p> "Vernor Vinge's latest novel is a triumph, continuing the most visionary, intelligent deep-space adventure of our time. Reason to cheer, indeed--and a great, long read it is." --Gregory Benford</p></p><h2>Nothing Between Us (A Loving on the Edge Novel)</h2><p>Unlike the heroine of her popular thriller series, Georgia Delaune can&#x2019;t afford to take risks or push sexual boundaries&#x2014;unless you count spying through her neighbor&#x2019;s bedroom window, and never missing a single move he makes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Colby Wilkes is more than willing to put on a show for the alluring woman next door.

Or taking risks. Or, okay, fine&#x2014;sexually deviant behavior. She was woman enough to admit what this was. So finding herself hiding in the dark, peering around the curtains of her second-story window with a set of binoculars, should&#x2019;ve tipped her off that she was officially losing her shit.</p><p>But since moving into the house on Fallen Oaks Lane six months earlier, she&#x2019;d known this moment was coming. Before now, she&#x2019;d convinced herself that she&#x2019;d only been catching inadvertent peeks and unintentional glimpses. Her neighbor would surely shut his curtains if he didn&#x2019;t want to risk being seen, right?</p><p>She groaned, lowered the binoculars, and pressed her forehead to the window frame. God, now she was blaming the victim. He gets naked in the confines of his own home. A home that&#x2019;s on a treed corner lot with tons of privacy and a seven-foot-tall fence. How dare he!</p><p>This was so screwed up. What if he saw her? He could call the cops, and she&#x2019;d be slapped with some Peeping Tom charge&#x2014;or Peeping Tammy, as the case may be. That&#x2019;d be an epic disaster. Especially when the cops found no information on a Georgia Delaune. Plus, afterward, she&#x2019;d have to move because there&#x2019;d be no facing her neighbor again. Not after he knew what she did at night. And there was no way in hell she was moving. It had taken too much time, effort, and planning to find this spot, to finally feel even a smidgen of security and safety. These walls were her only haven, and she had no intention of leaving them.</p><p>But despite knowing the risks, when she saw a lamp flick on and light glow in the window of Colby Wilkes&#x2019;s bedroom, she found herself dragging a chair over to the window and lifting the binoculars to her eyes. It took a second to adjust the focus, but when the lenses cleared, the broad, wet shoulders of her dark-haired neighbor filled the view. Her stomach dipped in anticipation.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t alone.</p><p>She&#x2019;d known he had friends over. She&#x2019;d seen the group going in when she&#x2019;d closed her living room blinds earlier that night. Two women and three guys, plus Colby. Later, she&#x2019;d heard water splashing and the murmuring of voices, so she&#x2019;d gone into her backyard for a while to listen to the distant sounds of life and laughter. That world seemed so foreign to her now. Being surrounded by people, having friends over, relaxing by the pool. She couldn&#x2019;t see anything from her backyard. Colby&#x2019;s pool area was blocked by the house and bordered by trees. So she&#x2019;d lain in her lounge chair out back, closed her eyes, and had imagined she was a guest at his party, that she was part of that laughter. And she&#x2019;d also found herself wondering what would happen afterward.</p><p>Now she knew. Colby had stepped into his bedroom, obviously fresh from the pool with his dark hair wet and only a towel knotted around his waist. And he had company with him. One of Colby&#x2019;s friends, a tall blond guy who was also sporting a towel, had followed him in. And then there was a woman. She wore nothing at all. Georgia&#x2019;s lip tucked between her teeth, heat creeping into her face. She so shouldn&#x2019;t be watching this. But she couldn&#x2019;t turn away. She&#x2019;d learned rather quickly that her dear neighbor, despite his affable grin, Southern-boy charm, and straitlaced job, was a freak in the bedroom. Threesomes were only part of it. The man was dominant to the core. Considering her last relationship, that alone should&#x2019;ve turned her off, sent her running. Guys who wanted control. Fuck, no.</p><p>But the first time she&#x2019;d caught sight of Colby bringing a flogger down on a lover&#x2019;s back, Georgia had been transfixed. She&#x2019;d been completely stuck on her latest writing project at the time. But after watching Colby drive a woman into a writhing, begging state, Georgia had gone into her office, opened a new document, and written until the sun had broken through the curtains the next morning. Before she knew it, her thriller-in-progress had taken a decidedly erotic turn. Thankfully, her editor had loved the new direction. So now Georgia, in her guiltiest moments, told herself these stolen moments at the window were all in the name of book research.</p><p>Yeah. Even her sleep-deprived brain didn&#x2019;t buy that one.</p><p>The guilt wasn&#x2019;t enough to make her stop, though. Especially now when Colby was grabbing for the knot on his towel. She held her breath. The terry cloth fell to the floor at Colby&#x2019;s feet, and everything inside Georgia went tight. Holy heaven above. She&#x2019;d watched&#x2014;oh, how she&#x2019;d watched&#x2014;but never before had she been able to see everything in such intimate detail. The binoculars transported her, took her by the hand and dragged her into that room with those strangers. Colby was right there in front of her&#x2014;strong, beautiful, aroused. His hand wrapped around his cock and stroked ever so slowly, taunting her with unashamed confidence. No, not her. The woman. God, Georgia should look away. But need rolled through her like thunder from an oncoming storm, her fingers tightening around the binoculars.</p><p>The other man had stripped, too, and although he was gorgeous in his own right with his polished, camera-ready good looks, Georgia was drawn to the rough-around-the-edges brawn of her neighbor. Every part of Colby hinted at the wildness he hid beneath his surface&#x2014;dark wavy hair that was a little too long, the close-cropped beard that shadowed his jaw, and a body that looked like he could bench-press a Buick. He was the opposite of the pressed and creased, Armani-clad businessmen she&#x2019;d been attracted to in her former life. He was the guy you&#x2019;d be wary of on first glance if you ran into him in a dark alley&#x2014;the cowboy whose hat color you couldn&#x2019;t quite determine straightaway.</p><p>Perhaps that was why she was so fascinated with him, despite the fact that he was a man who wanted what she could never give. She&#x2019;d learned that danger often hid behind the gloss of an urbane smile and perfectly executed Windsor knot. Colby was none of that. But regardless of the reason for her mixed-up attraction, she couldn&#x2019;t stem the crackle of jealousy that went through as the other man laced his fingers in the woman&#x2019;s hair and guided her to take Colby into her mouth.</p><p>The view of Colby&#x2019;s erection disappearing between the lips of some other woman was erotic. There was no denying that. But it also made Georgia&#x2019;s jaw clench a little too hard. She could tell, even from the brief moments she&#x2019;d been watching, that this woman belonged to Colby&#x2019;s friend. They were a couple and Colby the third party. But it still activated Georgia&#x2019;s He&#x2019;s mine, bitch! reflex.</p><p>Georgia sniffed at her ridiculous, territorial reaction, and tried to loosen the tension gathering in her neck. Sure, he&#x2019;s yours, girl. You can&#x2019;t walk down the street without swallowing a pill first, much less start something if he were even interested in the weird, spying chick next door.</p><p>But she shoved the thought away. She didn&#x2019;t want anything tainting these few precious minutes. This wasn&#x2019;t about finding a hookup. Only when she stood at this window did she feel even a glimmer of her former self trying to break through. This was her gossamer-thin lifeline to who she used to be, to the capable and confident woman who would&#x2019;ve never hidden in the dark.</p><p>Before long, the blond man eased the woman away from Colby and guided her toward himself, taking his turn. Georgia tilted the binoculars upward, finding Colby&#x2019;s face instead of focusing on the scene between the other man and his woman. What she found lurking in his expression wasn&#x2019;t what she expected. There was heat in Colby&#x2019;s eyes, interest for sure, but as she stared longer, she sensed a distance in those hazel depths. Like he was there with them but other . . . separate. Alone.</p><p>It probably was only because the other two were a couple. Or maybe it was Georgia&#x2019;s mind slapping labels on things to make herself feel better. But regardless, it made her chest constrict with recognition. She didn&#x2019;t know what was going on in his head. Or how seeing his friends together made him feel. But she knew loneliness. And for those few seconds, she was convinced Colby did, too. She pressed her fingertip against the cool glass of the window, tracing the outline of Colby&#x2019;s face. Needing to touch . . . something.</p><p>The glass might as well have been made of steel, the yards between the houses made of miles.</p><p>But she couldn&#x2019;t walk away. The night went on and there she sat, watching the three lovers move to the bed, the woman being cuffed to the headboard. The two men lavished her with hands and mouths and tongues. It was like watching a silent symphony, the arching of the woman&#x2019;s back the only thing Georgia needed to see to know exactly how these men were affecting their willing captive. The melancholy feelings that had stirred earlier had quickly been surpassed by ones much more base and primal. Georgia&#x2019;s body was growing hot and restless, her panties going damp.</p><p>When Colby braced himself between the woman&#x2019;s thighs and entered her, Georgia trained the binoculars on his face, unable to handle the image of him having sex with another woman. Her mind was developing quite the ability to focus on the fantasy and block out the unwanted parts. She only had a view of Colby&#x2019;s profile, but she watched with rapt attention as his jaw worked and his skin went slick with sweat instead of pool water.</p><p>Without giving it too much thought, she braced one elbow on the window ledge to hold the binoculars steady and let her other hand drift downward. Her cotton nightgown slid up her thighs easily. Somewhere her brain protested that this was wrong&#x2014;sick and sad. She had a perfectly functioning vibrator in her bedside drawer. She had an imagination strong enough to fuel an orgasm without doing this, without watching the man next door screw another woman. But her starved libido didn&#x2019;t seem to give a damn about morals or ethics or pride right now. There was need. And a solution. Simple as that.</p><p>As Colby&#x2019;s lips parted with a sound she could only imagine, Georgia&#x2019;s fingers found the edge of her panties and slipped beneath the material. Her body tightened at the touch and the little gasp she made reverberated in the dead silence of the guest bedroom. Colby&#x2019;s head dipped between his shoulders, and Georgia imagined it was her he was whispering passionate words to. That deep Texas drawl telling her how good it felt to be inside her, how sexy she was, how he was going to make her come. He would be a dirty talker, she had no doubt. No sweet nothings from Colby Wilkes.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment as she moved her fingers in the rhythm of Colby&#x2019;s thrust&#x2014;long, languid strokes that had a fire building from her center and radiating heat outward. It wouldn&#x2019;t take long. Her body was already singing with sensation, release hurtling toward her. But she wouldn&#x2019;t go over alone. She forced her eyes open, the binoculars still in her grip, and found Colby again. His dark hair was curling against his neck, sweat glistening at his temples. He had to be close, too. Every muscle in his shoulders and back had tensed. All of her attention zeroed in on him, and in her mind, the touch of her own fingers morphed into his&#x2014;his hands and body moving against her, inside her.</p><p>Every molecule in her being seemed to contract, preparing for the burst of energy to come. Her breath quickened, her heartbeat pulsing in her ears. And right as she was about to close her eyes and go over, Colby jerked his head to the side toward the window. His heated gaze collided with hers through the binoculars&#x2014;a dead-on eye lock that reached inside Georgia and flipped her inside out. He knows.</p><p>But she was too far gone for the shock to derail her. Orgasm careened through her with a force that made the chair scrape back across the wood floor. She moaned into the quiet, the binoculars slipping from her hand and jerking the strap around her neck. The part in the curtains fell shut, but she didn&#x2019;t notice. Everything was too bright behind her eyelids, too good, to worry about anything else but the way she felt in those long seconds. Enjoy. Don&#x2019;t think. Just feel.The words whispered through her as her fingers kept moving, her body determined to eke out every ounce of sensation she could manage.</p><p>But, of course, the blissful, mindless moments couldn&#x2019;t last forever. Chilly reality made a swift reappearance as her gown slipped back down her thighs and sweat cooled on her skin. She sat there, staring at the closed curtain and listening to her thumping heart. Colby couldn&#x2019;t know, right? His gaze had felt intense and knowing because the binoculars had made him seem so close. But her window was dark, her curtains darker, and the moon was throwing off enough light that it would make the glass simply reflect back the glow.</p><p>But her chest felt like a hundred hummingbirds had roosted there, beating their wings against her ribs. She wet her lips and swallowed past the constriction in her throat. She had to look. Would her neighbor be striding over here to demand what was going on? Would he be disgusted? Embarrassed? Angry?</p><p>God, she didn&#x2019;t even want to think about it. She wanted to turn around, go to her bedroom, and hide under the covers. But that was all her life had turned into now&#x2014;hiding. And though she couldn&#x2019;t fix that situation, she refused to create another one. So she forced herself to lean forward and peel the curtains back one more time, leaving the binoculars hanging around her neck.</p><p>What she saw made the hummingbirds thrash more. Colby wasn&#x2019;t in the room anymore. His friend was now with the woman in the bed, and both seemed totally absorbed in each other. Did that mean that Colby had left and was heading this way to confront her? She was about to go downstairs to check the yard but then paused when she realized nothing had changed about the view. Nothing at all. If Colby had been concerned about a nosy neighbor, he hadn&#x2019;t bothered to close the curtains or warn his friends. Surely he would&#x2019;ve done that.</p><p>She sat there, debating and worrying, but soon Colby returned to the bedroom. The man and woman had finished. Colby had on a pair of boxers and had brought clean towels in for everyone. He didn&#x2019;t look concerned. He didn&#x2019;t glance over at the window. He seemed perfectly relaxed as he helped uncuff the woman&#x2019;s hands, kissed her forehead in a friendly gesture, and then left his friends to sleep alone.</p><p>Georgia let out a long breath, sagging in the chair.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know.</p><p>She should stop taking this risk&#x2014;throw away the binoculars, put a bookcase in front of this damn window, and stop while she was ahead.</p><p>But she knew she wouldn&#x2019;t. She would find herself here again.</p><p>Because if she didn&#x2019;t have her secret nights with Colby Wilkes, what was left?</p><p>Four walls, long days, and fear.</p><p>She needed this. She just had to make sure he never found out.<br><br><b>TWO</b></p><p>October 31</p><p>Right before quitting time, Colby got a visit from the Grim Reaper.

A Spanish Jesuit, Acosta produced this account by drawing on his own observations as a missionary in Peru and Mexico, as well as from the writings of other missionaries, naturalists, and soldiers who explored the region during the sixteenth century. One of the first comprehensive investigations of the New World, Acosta&#x2019;s study is strikingly broad in scope. He describes the region&#x2019;s natural resources, flora and fauna, and terrain. He also writes in detail about the Amerindians and their religious and political practices.<br>A significant contribution to Renaissance Europe's thinking about the New World, Acosta's<i> Natural and Moral History of the Indies</i> reveals an effort to incorporate new information into a Christian, Renaissance worldview. He attempted to confirm for his European readers that a "new" continent did indeed exist and that human beings could and did live in equatorial climates. A keen observer and prescient thinker, Acosta hypothesized that Latin America's indigenous peoples migrated to the region from Asia, an idea put forth more than a century before Europeans learned of the Bering Strait. Acosta's work established a hierarchical classification of Amerindian peoples and thus contributed to what today is understood as the colonial difference in Renaissance European thinking.</p><p>The publications of the Hakluyt Society (founded in 1846) made available early accounts of exploration. This is a translation of the first detailed account of the geography and indigenous culture of South America, by Joseph de Acosta (1540-1600). Volume 1 describes the animals, plants and climate of South America."Jos� de Acosta&#x2019;s A Natural and Moral History of the Indies is the work of one of the sixteenth century&#x2019;s keenest minds. Based on more than seventeen years of personal experience in Peru and Mexico as well as correspondence with fellow Jesuits around the world, De Acosta creates a comparative understanding of the New World. This modern translation loses none of the freshness of Acosta&#x2019;s prose and thankfully makes available to readers one of the most widely read and most influential books ever written on the Americas."&#x2014;Thomas Cummins, University of Chicago <p>"A superb translation of Jose de Acosta&#x2019;s Natural History into contemporary English that has been long overdue, with a first-rate introduction by one of America&#x2019;s outstanding Hispanists. The volume should prove useful to those interested in the natural history of the New World, the history of the Jesuits, and an understanding of Catholic conversion efforts in the sixteenth century."&#x2014;Patricia Seed, Rice University</p></p><h2>Born Again in Brazil: The Pentecostal Boom and the Pathogens of Poverty</h2><p>A spiritual revolution is transforming the religious landscape of Latin America. Evangelical Protestantism, particularly Pentecostalism, has replaced Catholicism as the leading religion in thousands of barrios on the urban periphery. But in few Latin American nations have Protestants multiplied as rapidly as in Brazil. What accounts for this rise? Combining historical, political, and ethnographic research, R. Andrew Chestnut shows that the relationship between faith healing and illness in the conversion process is integral to the popularity of Pentecostalism among Brazil&#39;s poor. He augments his analysis of the economic and political factors with extensive interview material to capture his informants&#39; conversion experience. In doing so, he presents both a historical framework for a broad understanding of Pentecostalism in Latin America and insight into the personal motivations and beliefs of the crentes themselves.</p><p>R.

The fiendish entity was finally trapped, but when more bodies bearing satanic marks surface in Los Angeles, demon hunter Moira O&#x2019;Donnell fears the terror has only just begun.<br><br>Racing to L.A., Moira discovers that the City of Angels is fast becoming the demon Lust&#x2019;s decadent playground. She suspects another coven is at work, aided indirectly by her diabolical mother, the powerful witch Fiona. But when Moira&#x2019;s unwanted psychic powers intensify, she fears her connection to the underworld is putting everyone she cares about in grave danger.<br><br>As supernatural war erupts, Moira and smoldering, seductive Rafe Cooper are caught in the crossfire. Cornered by mortal and unearthly enemies, they must master all their own powers to survive&#x2014;and to understand if the intensely passionate feelings that bind them are Lust&#x2019;s demon magic or true desire.</p><p><b>Allison Brennan</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of many romantic thrillers, including <i>Kiss Me, Kill Me; Love Me to Death; Sudden Death;</i> and <i>Killing Fear</i>.<i> </i>A five-time RITA finalist and Daphne du Maurier Award winner, Brennan enjoys spending her free time reading, playing games, watching high school sports, and researching her novels.

She swallowed the scream that fought to escape.<br><br>She blinked and the blood was gone. The panicked rage faded. She almost&#x2014;almost, but not quite&#x2014;forgot the feeling of her hand clenching the heavy, balanced dagger. Almost forgot the sickening sound of the blade slicing through tendons, hitting bone, cutting out an invisible soul and throwing it to demons that tore it to shreds, feeding.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not real. It&#x2019;s not real. It&#x2019;s not real.<br><br>She repeated the mantra, reminding herself that it was only a nightmare, that she&#x2019;d certainly never killed a person.<br><br>The fear from the dream stayed; it always did. Moira lived with fear day in and day out, sometimes buried so deep she almost could believe it was gone. When she lied to herself.<br><br>As the nightmare faded, her vision blurred. The dim early-morning light coming from the edges of the closed blinds looked cloudy and surreal, like her nightmare. She felt a vision coming on . . . but that wasn&#x2019;t possible. She&#x2019;d never been fully awake for a vision before; they&#x2019;d always hit her in the moment of unease immediately following a nightmare, before she could claw her way back to consciousness.<br><br>She was awake&#x2014;knew she was awake&#x2014;but everything around her was foggy, while her mind started a movie she didn&#x2019;t want to see. Moira&#x2019;s gut reaction was to stop the onslaught of images, but she couldn&#x2019;t even if she&#x2019;d tried. In a rush, her mind flooded with thoughts not her own, sights she&#x2019;d never witnessed, feelings she&#x2019;d never had. No vision had ever been anything like this. Not this physical sense of evil seeping into every pore, filling her until she wanted to scream.<br><br>She flew across the continent and back, tired. Bored. Frustrated. There were many places she could stay, but none of them appealed to her. It was all too easy. The desires of the body were weak, and she was anything but weak. She wanted freedom, but wasn&#x2019;t free. She wanted vengeance, and she could have it&#x2014;have everything&#x2014;when she was free.<br><br>Freedom! Her time was now. She grew stronger with each passing day.<br><br>Yet, her spirit was caught by something stronger than she. She resisted, angry. But she was tied to the earth, and the harder she fought, the weaker she became. Spinning, spinning, spinning out of control, shrinking . . .<br><br>A weak, dark-haired woman sat in the circle, waiting for her. She fought the entrapment, but she&#x2019;d been in the astral plane, and her anchor had called her back.<br><br>Someone trapped her! She stretched and fought and vowed revenge on her captor. The mind that shared this body was foolish. She suppressed it. Brutally, without remorse.<br><br>Moira screamed as pain filled her head. For a split second, she thought she was possessed. She tasted the hot sulphur on her tongue, felt an evil presence under her skin; then it was gone. The vision, the pain, everything. Everything but the fear.<br><br>Her body shook violently. From the corner of her eye she saw movement&#x2014;something was in her room. She jumped out of bed, knife in hand without even thinking about reaching under her pillow for her weapon. She held it in front of her to ward off dark magic or a demon, making quick, confident strides toward the enemy.<br><br>&#x201c;Moira!&#x201d;<br><br>Rafe. She swallowed, blinked, tried to regain her focus as she wobbled on her feet. He grabbed her wrist and her vision cleared. She had been inches from him. What if she&#x2019;d hurt him? What if she&#x2019;d been trapped in a vision and killed him?<br><br>&#x201c;You were looking right at me, but you didn&#x2019;t see me,&#x201d; he said quietly.<br><br>She shook her head to clear her foggy mind and sat back heavily on the edge of her bed.<br><br>She had to get her mind wrapped around what had just happened. The nightmare, waking up, the vision&#x2014;being only inches from Rafe before she recognized him.<br><br>Maybe she had been asleep. That made her more dangerous to those she cared about.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been in Santa Louisa for nearly a month, but the last two weeks she&#x2019;d been doing nothing. Anthony Zaccardi, Santa Louisa&#x2019;s own resident demonologist, had his books and research, trying to track down the Seven Deadly Sins. Rafe had his physical therapy and retraining. And what did she have? Exercise until her body ached. Nightmares that reminded her of her deadly flaws. Visions almost daily for the past two weeks that left her drained and on edge. And still no trace of her mother, Fiona O&#x2019;Donnell, or Fiona&#x2019;s lover, Matthew Walker. In the last seven years she&#x2019;d never stayed in any one place this long, except when training to become a demon hunter at Olivet. At least there she&#x2019;d worked her ass off, too exhausted to go stir-crazy.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; she said, but not fast enough.<br><br>Rafe didn&#x2019;t believe her, but he didn&#x2019;t need words to ask. He never did. His dark, bottomless blue eyes questioned her, compelling the truth from her lips.<br><br>&#x201c;I had another vision,&#x201d; she admitted.<br><br>That she could say it out loud showed she&#x2019;d accepted the fact she was a freak. She&#x2019;d always known it, but now? Well, it sounded even crazier. But Rafe didn&#x2019;t think so, which was both comforting and scary as hell. They were so much alike . . . yet so different. She was scared to death of what might happen if she dropped her shields. There was no future for her; she couldn&#x2019;t lose her focus.<br><br>&#x201c;I think . . .&#x201d; How could she explain? &#x201c;One of them&#x2014;one of the demons&#x2014;found a host.&#x201d; That wasn&#x2019;t quite right, but she didn&#x2019;t understand everything she&#x2019;d felt and heard and thought. &#x201c;Or something like that.&#x201d; It sounded lame. It was lame.<br><br>&#x201c;Anthony doesn&#x2019;t believe they&#x2019;re seeking to possess anyone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anthony doesn&#x2019;t know everything,&#x201d; she snapped.<br><br>Rafe walked over to the dresser and leaned against it, crossing his arms over his chest. Already, two weeks after he miraculously awakened from his coma&#x2014;if that&#x2019;s what it was that had kept him unconscious for ten weeks&#x2014;he&#x2019;d regained his color and much of his strength. They were staying at Anthony and Skye&#x2019;s place&#x2014;hardly big enough for the four of them&#x2014;with Rafe sleeping on the couch. She needed to get out of this place. Not just because she itched to find her mother again, but because the close proximity to Rafe was too distracting. Not to mention Anthony&#x2019;s need to control both of them day and night, and Skye&#x2019;s constant questions. Moira liked the cop, but there were some things better left outside of the law. If Sheriff Skye McPherson knew even half the laws Moira had broken . . .<br><br>Rafe still didn&#x2019;t say anything. Damn, how annoying was that? He just pinned her with his sharp eyes, his unshaven square jaw locked, waiting for her to tell him the truth.<br><br>&#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s not possible,&#x201d; she began&#x2014;hoping it wasn&#x2019;t possible&#x2014;&#x201c;I just&#x2014;it felt&#x2014;&#x201d; She hesitated, then said what she truly feared. &#x201c;It felt like I was looking through the demon&#x2019;s eyes. I tasted Hell on my tongue, my blood burned. But&#x2014;I think&#x2014;&#x201d; She bit her lip.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She was pure evil, Rafe. Powerful. And really pissed off. She felt trapped, and somehow she blamed me.&#x201d; She gave him a half-smile. &#x201c;Stupid, I know.&#x201d;<br><br>Rafe didn&#x2019;t smile, nor did he say anything&#x2014;why was he always so damn quiet? Why couldn&#x2019;t he get angry like Anthony or frustrated like Skye? Instead, he was calm.<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t let anyone hurt you, demon or human.&#x201d;<br><br>He barely whispered, but she heard every word as if his voice etched them directly onto her bones. Every hair on her skin rose. He appeared unflappable, but his stoicism was a ruse&#x2014;he was a tightly controlled bundle of energy, his restlessness tangible but unseen. His words had movement and weight. He never had to raise his voice to be heard, and everyone listened.<br><br>She wanted to believe him. He meant what he said, but he wasn&#x2019;t strong enough to protect her&#x2014;or anyone&#x2014;from the Seven. Neither was she; none of them were. They&#x2019;d nearly died battling the demon Envy, and they had even lost one of their own. A loss she feared would be repeated until there was no one left standing.<br><br>Despair had moved in with her fear, but she fought it, questioning whether they were her own feelings or left from residual contact with the Seven. Was their power still present even though they had long left Santa Louisa?<br><br>All but the demon Envy, trapped in a tabernacle at St. Francis de Sales in downtown Santa Louisa, in a vault that Moira had commented was the supernatural equivalent of Fort Knox. Anthony hadn&#x2019;t been amused. He never was.<br><br>But Rafe had smiled at her joke behind Anthony&#x2019;s back, and winked at her, another reason why she was drawn to him. He liked her quick wit, and he made her smile.<br><br>&#x201c;For nearly two weeks, I&#x2019;ve been doing nothing but waiting for something we can&#x2019;t even identify,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;How can we stop the Seven Deadly Sins if we don&#x2019;t know where they are? Do we have to wait until someone drops dead? Do we have to wait until we hear on the news that Greed is working its evil magic on Wall Street or people are dying because they&#x2019;re too slothful to eat? And dammit, where did Fiona go? I can&#x2019;t feel her magic anymore. They&#x2019;re just gone, and I&#x2019;m waiting for them to come after me!

It focuses particularly on the work of Luk�cs, Korsch and Gramsci; Adorno, Marcuse and Benjamin; Sartre and Althusser; and Della Volpe and Colletti, together with other figures within Western Marxism from 1920 to 1975. The theoretical production of each of these thinkers is related simultaneously to the practical fate of working-class struggles and to the cultural mutations of bourgeois thought in their time. The philosophical antecedents of the various school within this tradition&#x2014;Luk�csian, Gramscian, Frankfurt, Sartrean, Althusserian and Della Volpean&#x2014;are compared, and the specific innovations of their respective systems surveyed. The structural unity of 'Western Marxism', beyond the diversity of its individual thinkers, is then assessed, in a balance-sheet that contrasts its heritage with the tradition of 'classical' Marxism that preceded it, and with the commanding problems which will confront any historical materialism to succeed it.</p><p><b>Perry Anderson</b> is the author of, among other books, <i>Spectrum</i>, <i>Lineages of the Absolutist State</i>, <i>Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism</i>, <i>Considerations on Western Marxism</i>, <i>English Questions</i>, <i>The Origins of Postmodernity</i>, and <i>The New Old World</i>.

Readers will eagerly follow noble Neverfell through its tunnels, marveling at the extraordinary sights and catching their breath at her daring escapades." (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>**STARRED REVIEW**<br> "Hardinge excels at wordplay and worldbuilding; witty but not trite, her utterly original setting and chaotic, fidgety protagonist anchor a cracking good story that raises important ideas surrounding the nature of friendship, the value of honesty, and the danger of too much, whether luxury, ambition, power, or desire...like Grandible's cheeses, this may cause visions&#x2014;or just make your head explode (with delight)." (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>**STARRED REVIEW**<br> "Hardinge is at the top of her game with this entrancing and action-packed adventure. Her voluptuous prose is full of sensory details and wildly imaginative descriptions...A compelling and triumphant follow-up to The Lie Tree for those who love to become immersed in a good story." (<i>School Library Journal</i>)<br><br>**STARRED REVIEW**<br>"Hardinge&#x2019;s characteristically lush and sophisticated language will entrance readers, and she makes wonderful use of her singular setting and wildly eccentric cast to pose haunting questions about reality, artifice, and the things we attempt to conceal." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>**STARRED REVIEW**<br>"There is wit in the writing style and cleverness the development of this crackling world, and readers will connect with Neverfell, the one girl who can&#x2019;t hide what she is feeling in a world that has no idea what that is like." (<i>Bulletin of the Center for Children&#x2019;s Books</i>)<br><br>**STARRED REVIEW**<br> "Frances Hardinge writes at full throttle, with luscious language, viscerally evocative descriptions and more plot twists and turns than the Minotaur's labyrinth... the wily storyline and gorgeous writing that will leave readers longing for a new Face to express their devotion to the author." (<i>Shelf Awareness</i>)<br><br>"Hardinge&#x2019;s imagination here is&#x2014;as ever&#x2014;ebullient, lavish, and original. Whether she&#x2019;s anatomizing expression as fashion accessory, describing the<br> effects of certain wines, or likening human maturation to that of cheeses, she needles into some of our dearest desires and foibles with sharp psychological insight. Her enthusiasm for language play brightens dark Caverna with the sparkle of wit; but most notably, she suggests how fundamental to human interaction our facial expressions are." (<i>The Horn Book</i>)<br><br>"To identify any aspect of this book is necessarily to sing its praises. The characters are engrossing, their relationships moving and lovely; Neverfell's innocence and capacity for love and kindness carry her through enormous social upheavals, while the mystery of her lost memory burns hot and furious and hidden inside her. But above anything else what astonished me about <i>A Face Like Glass</i> was its construction, its pure perfect pace, the mechanical gravity of its plot moving through its beat with meticulously crafted finesse... <i>A Face Like Glass </i>is everything like magic."

Sometimes just the small things are enough to set us reeling. Andrew Holecek offers us a progressive path beginning with common, easily understood hardships and moving on to more subtle and challenging ones that commonly arise on our spiritual journeys.</p><p>Andrew Holecek is an author, spiritual teacher, and humanitarian. As a long-time student of Buddhism, he frequently presents this tradition from a contemporary perspective - blending the ancient wisdom of the East with modern knowledge from the West. <br><br>In 2009, he released "The Power and the Pain: Transforming Spiritual Hardship into Joy", one of the few books describing the shadow side of the spiritual path. Known as an expert on death and dying, his next book "Preparing to Die: Practical Advice and Spiritual Wisdom from the Tibetan Buddhist Tradition" is coming out in June 2013.<br><br>Andrew teaches seminars throughout the country on spiritual hardship and the Tibetan views of life, death, and beyond. He is also the co-founder of the Global Dental Relief Project, and travels each year to India and Nepal to provide free care to impoverished children. globaldentalrelief.org/"From Andrew Holecek's first words, you know you can trust him. He writes from deeply felt experience as well as a masterful grasp of the vast dharma. His essential point is riveting: the path leading to the cessation of suffering necessarily includes suffering. This book is the essence of good meditation instruction."&#x2014;Irini Rockwell, author of <i>The Five Wisdom Energies</i> <br><br>"With brilliance and kindness, Andrew Holecek brings the shadow side of the spiritual path into the light helping the practitioner navigate the hardships he or she will inevitably discover. Holecek shows them for what they are&#x2014;necessary obstacles on all levels of the path that can either hinder or strengthen our practice, and we can indeed be grateful to him for so clearly and completely elucidating this profound and necessary but rarely mentioned side of the spiritual path."&#x2014;Dr. Jeremy Hayward, author of <i>Warrior-King of Shambhala: Remembering Ch�gyam Trungpa</i> <br><br>"The spiritual hardships that each of us face along the way can be literally hard to bear whether these are purely psychological pressures or events that impact us on a physical level as well. Yet they can be ameliorated when we see their connection to our path as a whole. That is the distinctive gift of <i>The Power and the Pain</i> for contemporary Buddhist practitioners. It helps us make sense of our individual experiences which, as unique as they are, have been challenging practitioners in different ways since the time of the Buddha. . . . When we move beyond our theories about the spiritual path into the actual practice of it, that is when the insights and methods offered in this book will become truly useful.

This was to be the longest, cruelest war ever fought at sea, comparable in scale only to the Second World War. New naval tactics were brought to bear, along with such unheard-of weapons as rockets, torpedoes, and submarines. The war on land saw the rise of the greatest soldier the world had ever known&#x2015;Napoleon Bonaparte&#x2015;whose vast ambition was thwarted by a genius he never met in person or in battle: Admiral Horatio Nelson.</p><p>Noel Mostert's narrative ranges from the Mediterranean to the West Indies, Egypt to Scandinavia, showing how land versus sea was the key to the outcome of these wars. He provides details of ship construction, tactics, and life on board. Above all he shows us the extraordinary characters that were the raw material of Patrick O'Brian's and C. S. Forester's magnificent novels.</p></p><p>Noel Mostert was the Montreal Star correspondent in New York and Europe during the 1950s and has since reported for different American magazines from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. He lives in Tangiers.For 22 years, the Napoleonic Wars ravaged Europe, toppled thrones, reshaped empires, and determined the diplomatic and political destinies of European nation-states for the next century. The land battles and chief military figures of those battles are familiar, even to many laypeople. The naval campaigns, perhaps less publicized, were equally as important in the defeat of Napol�on. Mostert, a former foreign correspondent, has written a stirring saga of these campaigns that is both comprehensive and easy to digest. Although Mostert doesn&#x2019;t neglect the technical aspects of naval warfare, he avoids the trap of allowing details to overwhelm his exciting narrative. This is a vast, fast-moving chronicle that ranges across great distances while examining a host of characters, both well known and relatively obscure. Mostert does justifiably place great emphasis on Admiral Nelson and the critical battle at Trafalgar. He also offers useful and interesting descriptions of less-prominent aspects of the wars, including conflicts with the Barbary pirates and the British struggles against the rise of American naval power. This is an outstanding survey of a prolonged struggle that helped shape world history. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>Rumpole Misbehaves</h2><p><b>The next novel in the Rumpole series from the beloved and bestselling master of the court</b><br><br> The Rumpole novels have garnered legions of fans who show no sign of abandoning their favorite curmudgeonly British barrister. Now in <i>Rumpole Misbehaves</i>, our hero takes on nothing less than the New Labour government when their ridiculous new Anti- Social Behavior Orders land a Timson child in front of the bench for playing soccer on a posh London street. However, Rumpole quickly discovers that the complainant is hiding some nefarious secrets of her own. As he investigates the murder of a prostitute with links to white slavery and unscrupulous dealings in a government department, Rumpole must also wrangle with his fellow barristers as they threaten him with an ASBO for bringing food, wine, and small cigars into his room in chambers.</p><p>John Mortimer is a playwright, novelist, and former practicing barrister who has written many film scripts as well as stage, radio, and television plays, the Rumpole plays, for which he received the British Academy Writer of the Year Award, and the adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x2019;s <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>. He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.Bill Wallis is wonderful in every respect. For starters, he sounds exactly like Leo McKern�s Rumpole, of BBC television. He also believably personifies everyone from officious wife Hilda to Soapy Sam, Fig Newton, and the various lowlifes who constitute Rumpole�s clientele. His multicharacter dialogue is unparalleled, and his pacing is never too fast or too slow. While plot is often secondary to the pleasures of characterization and commentary in this series, the present entry offers two tracks. One deals with Rumpole applying for Queen�s Counsel and Hilda (!) contemplating a career at the bar. The other involves three apparently disparate criminal cases which--surprise--turn out not to be wholly unrelated. R.E.K.

Much of the science deals with the arcane mysteries of quantum mechanics, lending the often grim events an absurdist twist appropriately reminiscent of Lewis Carroll. Several years after an experiment that opened a gateway from central Florida into other dimensions, Doc Weaver, a physicist turned U.S. naval officer, adapts an alien star drive to a nuclear submarine and creates humanity's first warp-capable star ship. The goal of Capt. Steven Blankemeier and Cmdr. Clay White of the Alliance Space Ship's unfortunately named <i>Vorpal Blade</i> is to scout out worlds contaminated by the alien Dreen. The awkward use of alien vocabulary to censor the predictably foul-mouthed marines only slightly hinders the shoot-'em-up action as the scientists and crew of the <i>Blade </i>blast through whatever adversity comes their way. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jammu. No sooner has Jammu been installed, though, than the city's leading citizens become embroiled in an all-pervasive political conspiracy. Set in mid-1980s, <i>The Twenty-Seventh City</i> predicts every unsettling shift in American life for the next two decades: suburban malaise, surveillance culture, domestic terrorism, paranoia. A classic of contemporary fiction, <i>The Twenty-Seventh City</i> shows us an ordinary metropolis turned inside out, and the American Dream unraveling into terror and dark comedy.</p></p><p><p>Jonathan Franzen is the author of four novels, including <i>Freedom</i>, the National Book Award-winning <i>The Corrections</i>, and <i>Strong Motion</i>; a personal history, <i>The Discomfort Zone</i>; two collections of essays, <i>Farther Away</i> and <i>How to Be Alone</i>; and translations of Frank Wedekind's <i>Spring Awakening</i> and Karl Kraus's essays titled <i>The Kraus Project</i>. He lives in New York City and Santa Cruz, California.</p>1<br>&nbsp;<br><br>In early June Chief William O'Connell of the St. Louis Police Department announced his retirement, and the Board of Police Commissioners, passing over the favored candidates of the city political establishment, the black community, the press, the Officers Association and the Missouri governor, selected a woman, formerly with the police in Bombay, India, to begin a five-year term as chief. The city was appalled, but the woman--one S. Jammu--assumed the post before anyone could stop her.<br>This was on August 1. On August 4, the Subcontinent again made the local news when the most eligible bachelor in St. Louis married a princess from Bombay. The groom was Sidney Hammaker, president of the Hammaker Brewing Company, the city's flagship industry. The bride was rumored to be fabulously wealthy. Newspaper accounts of the wedding confirmed reports that she owned a diamond pendant insured for $11 million, and that she had brought a retinue of eighteen servants to staff the Hammaker estate in suburban Ladue. A fireworks display at the wedding reception rained cinders on lawns up to a mile away.<br>A week later the sightings began. An Indian family of ten was seen standing on a traffic island one block east of the Cervantes Convention Center. The women wore saris, the men dark business suits, the children gym shorts and T-shirts. All of them wore expressions of controlled annoyance.<br>By the beginning of September, scenes like this had become a fixture of daily life in the city. Indians were noticed lounging with no evident purpose on the skybridge between Dillard's and the St. Louis Centre. They were observed spreading blankets in the art museum parking lot and preparing a hot lunch on a Primus stove, playing card games on the sidewalk in front of the National Bowling Hall of Fame, viewing houses for sale in Kirkwood and Sunset Hills, taking snapshots outside the Amtrak station downtown, and clustering around the raised hood of a Delta 88 stalled on the Forest Park Parkway. The children invariably appeared well behaved.<br>Early autumn was also the season of another, more familiar Eastern visitor to St. Louis, the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan. A group of businessmen had conjured up the Prophet in the nineteenth century to help raise funds for worthy causes. Each year He returned and incarnated Himself in a different leading citizen whose identity was always a closely guarded secret, and with His non-denominational mysteries He brought a playful glamour to the city. It had been written:<br><i>There on that throne, to which the blind belief</i><br><i>Of millions rais'd him, sat the Prophet-Chief</i>,<br><i>The Great Mokanna. O'er his features bung</i><br><i>The Veil, the Silver Veil, which he had flung</i><br><i>In mercy there, to hide from mortal sight</i><br><i>His dazzling brow, till man could bear its light</i>.<br>It rained only once in September, on the day of the Veiled Prophet Parade. Water streamed down the tuba bells in the marching bands, and trumpeters experienced difficulties with their embouchure. Pom-poms wilted, staining the girls' hands with dye, which they smeared on their foreheads when they pushed back their hair. Several of the floats sank.<br>On the night of the Veiled Prophet Ball, the year's premier society event, high winds knocked down power lines all over the city. In the Khorassan Room of the Chase-Park Plaza Hotel, the debbing had just concluded when the lights went out. Waiters rushed in with candelabras, and when the first of them were lit the ballroom filled with murmurs of surprise and consternation: the Prophet's throne was empty.<br>On Kingshighway a black Ferrari 275 was speeding past the windowless supermarkets and fortified churches of the city's north side. Observers might have glimpsed a snow-white robe behind the windshield, a crown on the passenger seat. The Prophet was driving to the airport. Parking in a fire lane, He dashed into the lobby of the Marriott Hotel.<br>"You got some kind of problem there?" a bellhop said.<br>"I'm the Veiled Prophet, twit."<br>On the top floor of the hotel He stopped outside a door and knocked. The door was opened by a tall dark woman in a jogging suit. She was very pretty. She burst out laughing.<br><br>When the sky began to lighten, low in the east over southern Illinois, the birds were the first to know it. Along the riverfront and in all the downtown parks and plazas, the trees began to chirp and rustle. It was the first Monday morning in October. The birds downtown were waking up.<br>North of the business district, where the poorest people lived, an early morning breeze carried smells of used liquor and unnatural perspiration out of alleyways where nothing moved; a slamming door was heard for blocks around. In the railyards of the city's central basin, amid the buzzing of faulty chargers and the sudden ghostly shiverings of Cyclone fences, men with flattops dozed in square-headed towers while rolling stock regrouped below them. Three-star hotels and private hospitals with an abject visibility occupied the higher ground. Farther west, the land grew hilly and healthier trees knit the settlements together, but this was not St. Louis anymore, it was suburb. On the south side there were rows upon rows of cubical brick houses where widows and widowers lay in beds and the blinds in the windows, lowered in a different era, would not be raised all day.<br>But no part of the city was deader than downtown. Here in the heart of St. Louis, in the lee of the whining all-night traffic on four expressways, was a wealth of parking spaces. Here sparrows bickered and pigeons ate. Here City Hall, a hip-roofed copy of the H�tel de Ville in Paris, rose in two-dimensional splendor from a flat, vacant block. The air on Market Street, the central thoroughfare, was wholesome. On either side of it you could hear the birds both singly and in chorus--it was like a meadow. It was like a back yard.<br>The keeper of this peace had been awake all night on Clark Avenue, just south of City Hall. Chief Jammu, on the fifth floor of police headquarters, was opening the morning paper and spreading it out beneath her desk lamp. It was still dark in her office, and from the neck down, with her hunched, narrow shoulders and her bony knees in knee socks and her restless feet, the Chief looked for all the world like a schoolgirl who'd been cramming.<br>Her head was older. As she leaned over the newspaper, the lamplight picked out white strands in the silky black hair above her left ear. Like Indira Gandhi, who on this October morning was still alive and the prime minister of India, Jammu showed signs of asymmetric graying. She kept her hair just long enough to pin it up in back. She had a large forehead, a hooked and narrow nose, and wide lips that looked blood-starved, bluish. When she was rested, her dark eyes dominated her face, but this morning they were cloudy and crowded by pouches. Wrinkles cut the smooth skin around her mouth.<br>Turning a page of the <i>Post-Dispatch</i> she found what she wanted, a picture of her taken on a good day. She was smiling, her eyes engaging. The caption<i>--Jammu: an eye to the personal--</i>brought the same smile back. The accompanying article, by Joseph Feig, had run under the headline A NEW LEASE ON LIFE. She began to read.<br>Few people remember it now, but the name Jammu first appeared in American newspapers nearly a decade ago. The year was 1975. The Indian subcontinent was in turmoil following Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's suspension of civil rights and her crackdown on her political foes.<br>Amid conflicting, heavily censored reports, a strange story from the city of Bombay began to unfold in the Western press. The reports concerned an operation known as Project Poori, implemented by a police official named Jammu. In Bombay, it seemed, the police department had gone into the wholesale food business.<br>The operation sounded crazy then; it sounds hardly less crazy today. But now that a twist of fate has brought Jammu to St. Louis in the role of police chief, people here are asking themselves whether Project Poori was really so crazy after all.<br>In a recent interview in her spacious Clark Avenue office, Jammu spoke of the circumstances that led up to the project.<br>"Before Mrs. Gandhi dispensed with the constitution the country was like Gertrude's Denmark--rotten to the core. But with the imposition of President's Rule, we in law enforcement had our chance to do something about it. In Bombay alone we were locking up 1,500 lawbreakers a week and impounding 30 million rupees in illegal goods and cash. When we evaluated our efforts after two months, we realized we'd hardly made one speck of progress," Jammu recalled.<br>President's Rule devolves from a clause in the Indian constitution giving the central government sweeping powers in times of emergency. For this reason, the 19 months of such rule were referred to as the Emergency.<br>In 1975 a rupee was worth about ten U.S. cents.<br>"I was an assistant commissioner at the time," Jammu said. "I suggested a different approach. Since threats and arrests weren't working, why not try defeating corruption on its own terms?<br>"Why not enter a business ourselves and use our resources and influence to achieve a freer market? We chose an essential commodity: food," she said.<br>It was thus that Project Poori was conceived. A <i>poori</i> is a deep-fried puff-bread, popular in India. By the end of 1975, Bombay was known to Western journalists as the one city in India where groceries were plentiful and the prices uninflated.<br>Naturally, attention centered on Jammu. Her handling of the operation, as detailed in the dailies and in <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>, caught the imagination of police forces in this country. But certainly no one would have guessed that one day she would be in St. Louis wearing the Chief's badge on her blouse and a department revolver on her hip.<br>Colonel Jammu, however, entering her third month in office, would have it seem the most natural thing in the world. "A good chief stresses personal involvement at all levels of the organization," she said. "Carrying a revolver is one symbol of my commitment.<br>"Of course, it's also an instrument of lethal force," she continued, leaning back in her office chair.<br>Jammu's frank, gutsy style of law-enforcement management has earned a reputation that is literally world-wide. When the search for a replacement for former Chief William O'Connell ended in its deadlock of opposing factions, Jammu's name was among the first mentioned as a compromise candidate. And despite the fact that she had no previous law-enforcement experience in the U.S., the Police Board confirmed her appointment less than a week after she arrived in St. Louis for interviews.<br>To many here, it came as a surprise that this Indian woman met the citizenship requirements necessary for her job. But Jammu, who was born in Los Angeles and whose father was American, says she went to great lengths to preserve her citizenship. Since she was a child she has dreamed of settling in America.<br>"I'm terribly patriotic," she said with a smile. "New residents, like myself, often are. I'm looking forward to spending many years in St. Louis. I'm here to stay."<br>Jammu speaks with slightly British intonations and striking clarity of thought. With her fine features and delicate build, she could hardly be less like the stereotype of the gruff, male American police chief. But her record gives an altogether different impression.<br>Within five years of entering the Indian Police Service in 1969, she became a deputy to the Inspector-General of Police in Maharashtra Province. Five years later, at the astonishing age of 31, she was named Commissioner of the Bombay police. At 35, she is both the youngest police chief in modern St. Louis history and the first woman to hold the post.<br>Before joining the Indian police she received a B.A. in electrical science from the University of Srinagar in Kashmir. She also did three semesters of postgraduate work in economics at the University of Chicago.<br>"I've worked hard," she said. "I've had plenty of luck, too. I doubt I'd have this job had I not received good press from Project Poori. But of course the real problem was always my sex. It wasn't easy to buck five millennia of sexual discrimination.<br>"Until I became a superintendent I routinely dressed as a man," Jammu reminisced.<br>Apparently, experiences like this played a key role in the Commissioners' selection of Jammu. In a city still struggling to overcome its image as a "loser," the Board's unorthodox choice makes good public-relations sense. St. Louis is now the largest U.S. city to have a female police chief.<br>Nelson A. Nelson, president of the Board, believes St. Louis should take credit for its leading role in making city government accessible to women. "It's affirmative action in the truest sense of the word," he commented.<br>Jammu, however, appeared to discount the issue. "Yes, I'm a woman, all right," she said with a smile.<br>As one of her primary goals, she names making city streets safer. While not offering to comment on the performances of past chiefs in this area, she did say that she was working closely with City Hall to devise a comprehensive plan for fighting street crime.<br>"The city needs a new lease on life, a fundamental shake-up. If we can get the business community and citizens' groups to aid us--if we can make people see that this is a <i>regional</i> problem--I'm convinced that in a very short time we can make the streets safe again," she said.<br>Chief Jammu is not afraid of making her ambitions known. One might venture to guess that she will meet with jealous opposition in whatever she attempts. But her accomplishments in India show her to be a formidable adversary, and a political figure well worth keeping an eye on.<br>"Project Poori is a good illustration," she pointed out. "We applied a new set of terms to a situation that appeared hopeless. We set up bazaars outside every station house. It improved our public image, and it improved morale. For the first time in decades we had no trouble attracting well-qualified recruits. Indian police have a reputation for corruption and brutality which is largely due to the inability to recruit responsible, well-educated constables. Project Poori began to change things."<br>Some of Jammu's critics have voiced fears that a police chief accustomed to the more authoritarian atmosphere of India might be insensitive to civil-rights issues in St. Louis. Charles Grady, spokesman for the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, has gone even further, urging that Jammu be dismissed before a "constitutional disaster" occurs.<br>Jammu strenuously rejects these criticisms. "I've been quite surprised by the reactions of the liberal community here," she said.<br>"Their concern arises, I believe, from an abiding distrust of the Third World in general. They overlook the fact that India's system of government has been deeply influenced by Western ideals, particularly, of course, by the British. They fail to distinguish between the Indian police rank-and-file, and the national officer corps, of which I was a member.<br>"We were trained in the British tradition of civil service. Standards were extremely high. We were continually torn between sticking up for our troops and sticking up for our ideals. My critics overlook the fact that it was this very conflict which made a position in the United States attractive to me.<br>"In fact, what strikes me now about Project Poori is how American our approach was. Into a clogged and bankrupt economy we injected a harsh dose of free enterprise. Soon hoarders found their goods worth half of what they'd paid for them. Profiteers went begging for customers. On a small scale, we achieved a genuine <i>Wirtschaftswunder</i>," Jammu recalled, refe...</p><h2>The Diamond Age</h2><p>The future is small.

Lee: The Forgotten Case against an American Icon</h2><p>History has been kind to Robert E. Lee. Woodrow Wilson believed General Lee was a &#x201c;model to men who would be morally great.&#x201d; Douglas Southall Freeman, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his four-volume biography of Lee, described his subject as &#x201c;one of a small company of great men in whom there is no inconsistency to be explained, no enigma to be solved.&#x201d; Winston Churchill called him &#x201c;one of the noblest Americans who ever lived.&#x201d; Until recently, there was even a stained glass window devoted to Lee's life at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.<br><br>Immediately after the Civil War, however, many northerners believed Lee should be hanged for treason and war crimes. Americans will be surprised to learn that in June of 1865 Robert E. Lee was indicted for treason by a Norfolk, Virginia grand jury. In his instructions to the grand jury, Judge John C. Underwood described treason as &#x201c;wholesale murder,&#x201d; and declared that the instigators of the rebellion had &#x201c;hands dripping with the blood of slaughtered innocents.&#x201d; In early 1866, Lee decided against visiting friends while in Washington, D.C. for a congressional hearing, because he was conscious of being perceived as a &#x201c;monster&#x201d; by citizens of the nation&#x2019;s capital. Yet somehow, roughly fifty years after his trip to Washington, Lee had been transformed into a venerable American hero, who was highly regarded by southerners and northerners alike. Almost a century after Appomattox, Dwight D. Eisenhower had Lee&#x2019;s portrait on the wall of his White House office.<br><br>The Lost Indictment of Robert E. Lee tells the story of the forgotten legal and moral case that was made against the Confederate general after the Civil War. The actual indictment went missing for 72 years. Over the past 150 years, the indictment against Lee after the war has both literally and figuratively disappeared from our national consciousness. In this book, Civil War historian John Reeves illuminates the incredible turnaround in attitudes towards the defeated general by examining the evolving case against him from 1865 to 1870 and beyond.</p><p>For over twenty-five years, John Reeves has been working to make complex subjects more interesting and accessible for students and general readers. For 15 years he taught European and American history at colleges in Chicago, the Bronx, and London. More recently, as an editor and writer at The Motley Fool, he produced investing-related content for millions of readers. He resides in Washington, D.C.In this well-crafted narrative, Reeves demystifies the Confederate general Robert E. Lee and the reasons he was given amnesty after the Civil War.... Reeves offers a timely portrait of how the cults of Lee and the states&#x2019; rights lost cause became firmly entrenched in American culture within only 25 years of the Civil War&#x2014;and still haunt 21st-century debates over Confederate monuments and battle flags. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>A provocative work of history and cultural analysis.... Mr. Reeves, a journalist and former history teacher, does an able job of untangling the shifting public sentiment, tactical misjudgments and legal ordeals that shaped the indictment and ultimately crippled it. (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>Perhaps nothing demonstrated the unwillingness of Americans to come to terms with the bloody history of 1861&#x2013;1865 so well as their veneration of Robert E. Lee. For decades (and without a sense of irony), northerners and southerners acclaimed the commander of the Army of Northern Virginia as an authentic national hero. . . . John Reeves&#x2019; new book, however, &#x201c;tells the story of the forgotten legal and moral case that was made against the Confederate general in the days after the Civil War.&#x201d; In his lively and accessible narrative, Reeves relates &#x201c;the history Americans tried to forget.&#x201d; (<i>New York Journal of Books</i>)<br><br>More so than any previous writer, Reeves makes clear that following the Civil War northerners held Lee accountable for all manner of sins&#x2014;not only treason and disunion&#x2014;but also for the abuse of white and black Union troops held in Confederate prisoner of war camps. Lee&#x2019;s ascension into the pantheon of Civil War icons, at least in the North, thus was a slow process. This is an important assessment. (John David Smith, author of An Old Creed for the New South: Proslavery Ideology and Historiography, 1865-1918)<br><br>This fine book delivers a great deal more than promised by the title. It not only clears up misconceptions about the aborted indictment of Lee and other Confederates for treason; it also offers incisive treatments of Lee's connections to slavery, secession, postwar Reconstruction, and the Southern cult of the Lost Cause. (James M. McPherson, Princeton University)<br><br>In John Reeves&#x2019; remarkable book, we see a telling and striking portrait of Robert E. Lee after the Civil War. Unheard of to many, this accurate portrayal of a murky character and time in our nation&#x2019;s history should be read and consumed by all. (The Reverend Robert W. Lee, IV, Professor and Pastor, Collateral Descendent of Confederate General Robert E. Lee)<br><br>At a time when memorials to Lee arouse controversy, John Reeves reminds us that Lee aroused bitter disagreement during his own lifetime. Delving into the circumstances surrounding Lee&#x2019;s little remembered indictment for treason after the Civil War, Reeves weaves a timely and fascinating story of Lee&#x2019;s actions and reputation, the definition of treason, and the eventual elevation of the former Confederate to the pantheon of American heroes. Anyone interested in the roots of our contemporary debates would do well to reflect upon the history so ably recounted in the Lost Indictment of Robert E. Lee. (W. Fitzhugh Brundage, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)<br><br>&#x201c;Reeve&#x2019;s study of the abortive Lee treason prosecution offers fresh insight into the tortured ending of the Civil War, the movement toward white sectional reconciliation at the expense of African American rights, and the construction of the Lost Cause, of which Lee is both an essential figure and initial architect.&#x201d; (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>John Reeves titled his introduction to this work &#x201c;Reevaluating Robert E. Lee&#x201d; but The Lost Indictment of Robert E. Lee is a reevaluation of many things. Reeves reevaluates Robert E. Lee after 1865, the attempted legal case against him and other former Confederates, and Lee&#x2019;s views on slavery, the war, and Reconstruction. He also reevaluates Andrew Johnson&#x2019;s role in punishing former Confederates, the attempt and failure to secure punishment against Confederate leaders, and the creation of the Lost Cause in the aftermath of the war. Overall, The Lost Indictment is a fascinating and enjoyable read that untangles many questions about the transition from war to peace after the destructive Civil War.

Yet of all the major institutions in American society, none take climate change as seriously as the U.S. military. Both as participants in climate-triggered conflicts abroad, and as first responders to hurricanes and other disasters on American soil, the armed services are already confronting the impacts of global warming. The military now regards climate change as one of the top threats to American national security&#x2015;and is busy developing strategies to cope with it.</p><p>Drawing on previously obscure reports and government documents, renowned security expert Michael Klare shows that the U.S. military sees the climate threat as imperiling the country on several fronts at once. Droughts and food shortages are stoking conflicts in ethnically divided nations, with &#x201c;climate refugees&#x201d; producing worldwide havoc. Pandemics and other humanitarian disasters will increasingly require extensive military involvement. The melting Arctic is creating new seaways to defend.

Denied access to heaven because of what he considers a few minor transgressions, Tempest refuses to go to hell. Stymied, Saint Peter sends him back to Harlem, where a guiding angel tries to convince him to accept Saint Peter's judgment, and even the Devil himself tries to win over Tempest&#x2019;s soul. Through the street-smart Landry, Mosley poses the provocative question: Is sin for blacks the same as it is for whites? And who gets to decide?</p><p>Walter Mosley is the author of five Easy Rawlins mysteries:Devil in A Blue Dress,A Red Death, White Butterfly, Black Betty and A Little Yellow Dog; three non-mystery novels, Blue Light, Gone Fishin, and R. L.&#39;s Dream; two collections of stories featuring Socrates Fortlow, Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned, for which he received the Anisfield Wolf Award, and which was an HBO movie, and a nonfiction book, Workin&#39; On The Chain Gang. He is a former president of the Mystery Writers of America, a founder of the PEN American Center Open Book Committee, and is on the board of directors of the National Book Awards. A native of Los Angeles, he now lives in New York City.<p> <b>LIFE AND DEATH</b> <br> <br> </p><p> TEMPEST LANDRY DIDN'T see himself as a bad man. He had a wife, whom he loved, a steady girlfriend, who loved him passionately, and various women on the side. All in all he had fourteen children, which was impressive because he was only thirty-four years old when he died. </p><p> Not a thief by nature, he would pick up a dollar tip if it was lying on a table and no one was looking. If there was a key in a door he'd turn the lock to see what was on the other side. If a man was selling anything from steak knives to steaks on the corner he wouldn't ask for a vendor's license if the street salesman didn't charge tax. </p><p> Tempest loafed when he could and worked when he had to. He remembered his wife's anniversary and the birthdays of all his children and girlfriends. And though he had been arrested on various occasions he had never been convicted of a felony nor had he spent more than a week in jail. </p><p> Tempest wasn't ashamed of his history, but neither was he the victim of pride. He had been in seven serious fights since the age of fourteen and though some blood had been shed no Mosley one had died. He was always courteous with policemen, and so in the last few seconds of life he was miffed that they could shoot him down the way they did when he had never so much as used the "f" word when they rousted him in the street or from out of his own bed. </p><p> In a way it was technology that killed him and not the police at all. His steady girl, Alfreda, had bought him a mini disc player that didn't work right. It would get half the way through a tune and then switch channels or tracks or something so that suddenly it would be playing a whole other song. Tempest was walking up Adam Clayton Powell in Harlem, headed home to show his wife the new toy. Little did he know that an armed robber, Frank Elsworthy, had just robbed the new Starbucks coffee shop on 125th. </p><p> Tempest was wearing tan slacks and a dark, square-cut shirt, and so was Frank. They were both Negro and under forty. The thief was armed and desperate; Tempest had a mini disc player in his pocket that wouldn't play right, which made him mad. </p><p> And so when Frank cut east on 127th the police missed it and set their sights on Tempest. There were sirens but Lauryn Hill drowned them out. In the middle of "Killing Me Softly" the music went dead. Tempest shoved his hand in his pocket and pulled out the mini disc player, ready to throw it on the pavement. All of a sudden he got the twitching fits. Something was hitting him and then he was on the ground, tasting blood. </p><p> Lauryn Hill began singing again as Tempest faded from life. <br> </p><p> THE NEXT THING TEMPEST knew, he was standing in a long line of people that ran down from a steep mountain trail. To his left there was a hazy landscape where furtive figures moved back and forth deep inside the gloomy fog. To the right was a vast plain of rolling hills and valleys under a bright sky with clouds that made him think of God. </p><p> Though there were people before and behind Tempest, many thousands of them, for some reason he couldn't focus on anyone's face. Miles up ahead a large man sat at a granite table, hunched over a large book that Tempest knew instinctively was a volume in the great compilation of the sins of man. </p><p> It seemed odd to Tempest that he could see the old man and his book so clearly when they were many miles away, but he still could not make out the face of the man, or woman, behind him. </p><p> St. Peter looked up at a sad soul before him and read a long list of complaints that we accounting angels had compiled during the man's life. There were thefts and lies, an abused child, and some sort of insurance fraud that Tempest didn't quite understand. </p><p> The man, whoever he was, had stolen a jar of cash out of his dead mother's home before his brother arrived from St. Louis for the funeral. The list was long but the judge read it patiently, without anger or acrimony. </p><p> The man, for his part, nodded every time a complaint was read, saying, "I know, I know," the saddest defeat in his voice. </p><p> Finally Peter looked up with blue-gray eyes that had deep furrows at their corners. He seemed so sorrowful that Tempest felt near tears. Peter uttered a word and with only a gasp the sinner turned to his left and wandered off into the foggy limbo that Tempest now understood must be the outer edge of hell. </p><p> It was then that Tempest realized that each one of the ever growing line of dead souls had witnessed this judgment. This was death, and every man, woman, and child who died were onlookers to eternity. </p><p> Tempest had never been a patient man. His mother said that instead of crying he thanked the doctor for his liberation. "He was crawlin' by two months," Mrs. Landry used to say. "He was runnin' before he could walk." </p><p> It was true that Tempest never sat still. </p><p> "Maybe if they taught history on the basketball court," he told his teacher, "I might get somethin', but you know it's hell sittin' in this chair." </p><p> Tempest was impatient, fretful, and always on the verge of getting angry, but not on that final line. He approached his maker's judge with the same deep interest he had for Oprah and Doctor Phil. Several times he tried to engage his neighbors in conversation about the nature of some sins. Like the woman who had murdered her sister for using her own perfume while committing adultery with her husband. </p><p> "That there's a hard one," Tempest said to the soul in front of him. "I guess the woman borrowed the perfume to save her sister the pain of smelling another woman's scent on her man. Do you think they both got sent to the left?" </p><p> The soul ahead did not answer. Tempest wondered if he even heard him. Maybe everybody was chattering away, Tempest thought, but the rule of heaven had made them mute. </p><p> After many thousands of judgments; after millions of sins, from blasphemy to murder, Tempest found himself standing before St. Peter. </p><p> "Tempest Landry," the judge spoke. </p><p> "Here," Tempest said. </p><p> The old man might have smiled before turning the page of his great book. </p><p> "You stabbed Quentin Sams on July sixteenth when you were only fifteen." </p><p> "Excuse me, your honor, but that there was in self-defense. Q-boy was reachin' for the pistol in his pocket when he saw me kissin' on a girl who had broke it off with him that mornin'." </p><p> Peter looked up from his book with pique in his visage. No one had seen such a look since the Mahatma had refused the refuge of heaven. </p><p> Running a finger down the page Peter again began reading, "At eighteen you stole three hundred and fourteen dollars from your mother's own church." </p><p> "Actually," Tempest said, holding up his hands as if to apologize for his impudence, "I know it looks like I stole from the church but really I only took from Reverend Langly. I mean I had seen him down at Bertha Burnett's cat house throwin' away the congregation's money on the women and liquor. And I used that money to pay for my auntie's groceries while she was out of work and recoverin' from the pneumonia. The way I saw it I was takin' the church's money away from the devil and puttin' it to work for God the way it was meant to be used." </p><p> Peter's stare this time lasted more than the three months needed to separate sin from saintliness in the arrogant Joan of Arc. </p><p> When Peter went back to his notes there was no compassion left in his voice. </p><p> "You bore false witness against Tiny Henderson when you knew that he was innocent. Your lies," all of us on duty that day ere sure that the word lies was not in the record, "helped to convict this man of a brutal crime which he did not commit." </p><p> "Now, judge, I admit that there's some gray area in these other accusations but in the case of Henderson versus Harlemin- general I think that you would have to agree that it was my duty to bear false witness against that neighbor." </p><p> "What do you mean?" St. Peter asked. </p><p> This was unthinkable. No guardian of heaven's gate had ever questioned a soul before him. Never. The choir began murmuring. The line of millions of souls heard our consternation as beautiful music. </p><p> "I mean," Tempest replied to the keeper's question, "that Tiny Henderson had brutalized, raped, and murdered throughout our community and had not been convicted or jailed for years. I knew a man that he killed. I heard him brag on it. So when I lied before that magistrate it was really a truth, just that he hadn't done one thing but he had done another." </p><p> Peter slammed the book shut and pointed angrily toward the foggy limbo that led unerringly to eternal damnation. </p><p> "Go to hell!" the saint commanded. </p><p> "No," Tempest said. </p><p> The choir went silent. </p><p> "No?" </p><p> "You said what I did and I gave you my reasons why. But you didn't come back and explain why my whys were wrong." </p><p> Another month of celestial time passed as Peter studied the strange man before him. </p><p> "You honestly feel that you are virtuous?" Peter asked. </p><p> "I ain't no virgin," Tempest said. "But then again, I ain't no sinner neither." </p><p> "Then you will not follow my direction and enter into damnation?" </p><p> "Not unless you can prove to me I done wrong. Either that or throw me in the pit yourself." </p><p> Peter nodded and Tempest disappeared from the eternal procession of justice. <br> </p><p> THREE YEARS AFTER HIS death Tempest reappeared on the corners of 135th and Lenox. He was wearing the same clothes but his body was changed. He was still a black man, still under forty but he had a new face that no one would have recognized as Tempest Landry. </p><p> I walked up to him then and said, "Hello, Tempest. Welcome back to earth." </p><p> "Who are you?" </p><p> "I am your angel. Either vengeful or guardian, that is up to you." </p><p> "Angel? You mean that wasn't no dream?" </p><p> "Look in the glass," I said. </p><p> He followed my suggestion and fell back in shock. </p><p> "What happened to me?" </p><p> "The Infinite has thrown you back, Tempest. And I have been sent along to monitor your progress." </p><p> "Progress in what?" </p><p> "You told the keeper that you saw no sin in your life." </p></p><h2>Radical Hermeneutics: Repetition, Deconstruction, and the Hermeneutic Project (Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy)</h2><p><p>"This is a remarkable book: wide-ranging, resonant, and well-written; it is also reflective and personable, warm and engaging." &#x2015;Philosophy and Literature</p><p>"With this book Caputo takes his place firmly as the foremost American, continental post-modernist...

Her mind is always full of new ideas, often inspired by the beautiful yarns stocked in the shop. Sue lives in Milton Keynes with her husband, five children and a selection of pets.www.theknittinghut.co.ukJuly 2015 Surround yourself with knitted decorations this Christmas and put the homemade back into the holidays. If you liked the Twenty To Make book Mini Christmas Knits (also reviewed on this site) by the same author then here is another batch of festive projects. There are twenty-six items to make in here, as well as a larger format which will open flat after a bit of use (always a good thing). None of the projects uses much yarn so this is a good opportunity to use up oddments in your stash as well as having fun with sparkly lurex yarns. You can knit a Nativity scene to start with, complete with hanging star and a stable to put everybody in. The rest of the book has Santa, elf, penguins in jumpers, a sleigh with reindeer, hanging decorations like a turkey, mistletoe, baubles and even a wee paper chain not made of paper to name a few. Each project has a full page photograph plus written instructions, what you need and how to make up. This is not a book that teaches knitting from scratch, and is aimed at the intermediate knitter who can cope with tiny detailed work and has a few projects under their belt. There is an impressive section showing how to make up the reindeer, make the heads, do a few common embroidery stitches, make an i-cord and do three-needle castoff with staged photographs. Sadly there is nothing like this for the rather complex words-only description of Kitchener stitch, blanket stitch and "wrap and turn"; this would have been really useful. Apart from this I was pleased with this lovely book of projects that are sure to make any Christmas decorating look special and handmade.

Broken lanterns and glass shards litter the floor of this room, and paint is peeling from every wall. In one corner, an old portrait of the Elector Primo lies faceup on the ground.

No one enters or leaves the home after that&#x2014;at least, not when anyone&#x2019;s looking.<br><br>&#x201c;Still don&#x2019;t see them?&#x201d; Tess whispers. Shadows conceal her expression.<br><br>In an attempt to distract myself, I&#x2019;m piecing together a makeshift slingshot out of old PVC pipes. &#x201c;They haven&#x2019;t eaten dinner. They haven&#x2019;t sat down by the table in hours.&#x201d; I shift and stretch out my bad knee.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;re not home?&#x201d;<br><br>I shoot Tess an irritated glance. She&#x2019;s trying to console me, but I&#x2019;m not in the mood. &#x201c;A lamp&#x2019;s lit. Look at those candles. Mom would never waste candles if no one was home.&#x201d;<br><br>Tess moves closer. &#x201c;We should leave the city for a couple weeks, yeah?&#x201d; She tries to keep her voice calm, but the fear is there. &#x201c;Soon the plague will have blown through, and you can come back to visit. We have more than enough money for two train tickets.&#x201d;<br><br>I shake my head. &#x201c;One night a week, remember? Just let me check up on them one night a week.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. You&#x2019;ve been coming here every night this week.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I just want to make sure they&#x2019;re okay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What if you get sick?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take my chances. And you didn&#x2019;t have to come with me. You could&#x2019;ve waited for me back in Alta.&#x201d;<br><br>Tess shrugs. &#x201c;Somebody has to keep an eye on you.&#x201d; Two years younger than me&#x2014;although sometimes she sounds old enough to be my caretaker.<br><br>We look on in silence as the soldiers draw closer to my family&#x2019;s house. Every time they stop at a home, one soldier pounds on the door while a second stands next to him with his gun drawn. If no one opens the door within ten seconds, the first soldier kicks it in. I can&#x2019;t see them once they rush inside, but I know the drill: a soldier will draw a blood sample from each family member, then plug it into a handheld reader and check for the plague. The whole process takes ten minutes.<br><br>I count the houses between where the soldiers are now and where my family lives. I&#x2019;ll have to wait another hour before I know their fate.<br><br>A shriek echoes from the other end of the street. My eyes dart toward the sound and my hand whips to the knife sheathed at my belt. Tess sucks in her breath.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a plague victim. She must&#x2019;ve been deteriorating for months, because her skin is cracked and bleeding everywhere, and I find myself wondering how the soldiers could have missed this one during previous inspections. She stumbles around for a while, disoriented, then charges forward, only to trip and fall to her knees. I glance back toward the soldiers. They see her now. The soldier with the drawn weapon approaches, while the eleven others stay where they are and look on. One plague victim isn&#x2019;t much of a threat. The soldier lifts his gun and aims. A volley of sparks engulfs the infected woman.<br><br>She collapses, then goes still. The soldier rejoins his comrades.<br><br>I wish we could get our hands on one of the soldiers&#x2019; guns. A pretty weapon like that doesn&#x2019;t cost much on the market&#x2014;480 Notes, less than a stove. Like all guns, it has precision, guided by magnets and electric currents, and can accurately shoot a target three blocks away. It&#x2019;s tech stolen from the Colonies, Dad once said, although of course the Republic would never tell you that. Tess and I could buy five of them if we wanted. . . . Over the years we&#x2019;ve learned to stockpile the extra money we steal and stash it away for emergencies. But the real problem with having a gun isn&#x2019;t the expense. It&#x2019;s that it&#x2019;s so easy to trace back to you. Each gun has a sensor on it that reports its user&#x2019;s hand shape, thumbprints, and location. If that didn&#x2019;t give me away, nothing would. So I&#x2019;m left with my homemade weapons, PVC pipe slingshots, and other trinkets.<br><br>&#x201c;They found another one,&#x201d; Tess says. She squints to get a better look.<br><br>I look down and see the soldiers spill from another house. One of them shakes a can of spray paint and draws a giant red X on the door. I know that house. The family that lives there once had a little girl my age. My brothers and I played with her when we were younger&#x2014;freeze tag and street hockey with iron pokers and crumpled paper.<br><br>Tess tries to distract me by nodding at the cloth bundle near my feet. &#x201c;What&#x2019;d you bring them?&#x201d;<br><br>I smile, then reach down to untie the cloth. &#x201c;Some of the stuff we saved up this week. It&#x2019;ll make for a nice celebration once they pass the inspection.&#x201d; I dig through the little pile of goodies inside the bundle, then hold up a used pair of goggles. I check them again to make sure there are no cracks in the glass. &#x201c;For John. An early birthday gift.&#x201d; My older brother turns nineteen later this week. He works fourteen-hour shifts in the neighborhood plant&#x2019;s friction stoves and always comes home rubbing his eyes from the smoke. These goggles were a lucky steal from a military supply shipment.<br><br>I put them down and shuffle through the rest of the stuff. It&#x2019;s mostly tins of meat and potato hash I stole from an airship&#x2019;s cafeteria, and an old pair of shoes with intact soles. I wish I could be in the room with all of them when I deliver this stuff. But John&#x2019;s the only one who knows I&#x2019;m alive, and he&#x2019;s promised not to tell Mom or Eden.<br><br>Eden turns ten in two months, which means that in two months he&#x2019;ll have to take the Trial. I failed my own Trial when I was ten. That&#x2019;s why I worry about Eden, because even though he&#x2019;s easily the smartest of us three boys, he thinks a lot like I do. When I finished my Trial, I felt so sure of my answers that I didn&#x2019;t even bother to watch them grade it. But then the admins ushered me into a corner of the Trial stadium with a bunch of other kids. They stamped something on my test and stuffed me onto a train headed downtown. I didn&#x2019;t get to take anything except the pendant I wore around my neck. I didn&#x2019;t even get to say good-bye.<br><br>Several different things could happen after you take the Trial.<br><br>You get a perfect score&#x2014;1500 points. No one&#x2019;s ever gotten this&#x2014;well, except for some kid a few years ago who the military made a goddy fuss over. Who knows what happens to someone with a score that high? Probably lots of money and power, yeah?<br><br>You score between a 1450 and a 1499. Pat yourself on the back because you&#x2019;ll get instant access to six years of high school and then four at the top universities in the Republic: Drake, Stanford, and Brenan. Then Congress hires you and you make lots of money. Joy and happiness follow. At least according to the Republic.<br><br>You get a good score, somewhere between 1250 and 1449 points. You get to continue on to high school, and then you&#x2019;re assigned to a college. Not bad.<br><br>You squeak by with a score between 1000 and 1249. Congress bars you from high school. You join the poor, like my family. You&#x2019;ll probably either drown while working the water turbines or get steamed to death in the power plants.<br><br>You fail.<br><br>It&#x2019;s almost always the slum-sector kids who fail. If you&#x2019;re in this unlucky category, the Republic sends officials to your family&#x2019;s home. They make your parents sign a contract giving the government full custody over you. They say that you&#x2019;ve been sent away to the Republic&#x2019;s labor camps and that your family will not see you again. Your parents have to nod and agree. A few even celebrate, because the Republic gives them one thousand Notes as a condolence gift. Money and one less mouth to feed? What a thoughtful government.<br><br>Except this is all a lie. An inferior child with bad genes is no use to the country. If you&#x2019;re lucky, Congress will let you die without first sending you to the labs to be examined for imperfections.<br><br>Five houses remain. Tess sees the worry in my eyes and puts a hand on my forehead. &#x201c;One of your headaches coming on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m okay.&#x201d; I peer in the open window at my mother&#x2019;s house, then catch my first glimpse of a familiar face. Eden walks by, then peeks out the window at the approaching soldiers and points some handmade metal contraption at them. Then he ducks back inside and disappears from view. His curls flash white-blond in the flickering lamplight. Knowing him, he probably built that gadget to measure how far away someone is, or something like that.<br><br>&#x201c;He looks thinner,&#x201d; I mutter.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s alive and walking around,&#x201d; Tess replies. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say that&#x2019;s a win.&#x201d;<br><br>Minutes later, we see John and my mother wander past the window, deep in conversation. John and I look pretty similar, although he&#x2019;s grown a little stockier from long days at the plant. His hair, like most who live in our sector, hangs down past his shoulders and is tied back into a simple tail. His vest is smudged with red clay. I can tell Mom&#x2019;s scolding him for something or other, probably for letting Eden peek out the window. She bats John&#x2019;s hand away when a bout of her chronic coughing hits her. I let out a breath. So. At least all three of them are healthy enough to walk. Even if one of them is infected, it&#x2019;s early enough that they&#x2019;ll still have a chance to recover.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t stop imagining what will happen if the soldiers mark my mother&#x2019;s door. My family will stand frozen in our living room long after the soldiers have left. Then Mom will put on her usual brave face, only to sit up through the night, quietly wiping tears away. In the morning, they&#x2019;ll start receiving small rations of food and water and simply wait to recover. Or die.<br><br>My mind wanders to the stash of stolen money that Tess and I have hidden. Twenty-five hundred Notes. Enough to feed us for months . . . but not enough to buy my family vials of plague medicine.<br><br>The minutes drag on. I tuck my slingshot away and play a few rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors with Tess. (I don&#x2019;t know why, but she&#x2019;s crazy good at this game.) I glance several times at my mother&#x2019;s window, but don&#x2019;t see anyone. They must have gathered near the door, ready to open it as soon as they hear a fist against the wood.<br><br>And then the time comes. I lean forward on the ledge, so far that Tess grips my arm to make sure I don&#x2019;t topple to the ground. The soldiers pound on the door. My mother opens it immediately, lets the soldiers in, and then closes it. I strain to hear voices, footsteps, anything that might come from my house. The sooner this is all over, the sooner I can sneak my gifts to John.<br><br>The silence drags on. Tess whispers, &#x201c;No news is good news, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very funny.&#x201d;<br><br>I count off the seconds in my head. One minute passes. Then two, then four, and then finally, ten minutes.<br><br>Then fifteen minutes. Twenty minutes.<br><br>I look at Tess. She just shrugs. &#x201c;Maybe their reader&#x2019;s broken,&#x201d; she suggests.<br><br>Thirty minutes pass. I don&#x2019;t dare move from my vigil. I&#x2019;m afraid something will happen so quickly that I&#x2019;ll miss it if I blink. My fingers tap rhythmically against the hilt of my knife.<br><br>Forty minutes. Fifty minutes. An hour.<br><br>&#x201c;Something&#x2019;s wrong,&#x201d; I whisper.<br><br>Tess purses her lips. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes I do. What could possibly take this long?&#x201d;<br><br>Tess opens her mouth to reply, but before she can say anything, the soldiers are exiting my house, single file, expressionless. Finally, the last soldier shuts the door behind him and reaches for something tucked at his waist. I suddenly feel dizzy. I know what&#x2019;s coming.<br><br>The soldier reaches up and sprays one long, red, diagonal line on our door. Then he sprays another line, making an X.<br><br>I curse silently under my breath and start to turn away&#x2014;<br><br>&#x2014;but then the soldier does something unexpected, something I&#x2019;ve never seen before.<br><br>He sprays a third, vertical line on my mother&#x2019;s door, cutting the X in half.<br><br><b>1347 HOURS.</b><br><br><b>D</b>RAKE<b> U</b>NIVERSITY<b>, B</b>ATALLA SECTOR<b>.</b><br><br><b>72�F </b>INDOORS<b>.</b><br><br><b>I&#x2019;M SITTING IN MY DEAN SECRETARY&#x2019;S OFFICE.

Building upon his previous study, the critically acclaimed Paul and Palestinian Judaism, E.P. Sanders explores Paul&#39;s Jewishness by concentrating on his overall relationship to Jewish tradition and thought. Sanders addresses such topics as Paul&#39;s use of scripture, the degree to which he was a practicing Jew during his career as apostle to the Gentiles, and his thoughts about his &#34;kin by race&#34; who did not accept Jesus as the messiah. In short, Paul&#39;s thoughts about the law and his own people are re-examined with new awareness and great care. Sanders addresses an important chapter in the history of the emergence of Christianity. Paul&#39;s role in that development -- specially in light of Galatians and Romans -- is now re-evaluated in a major way. This book is in fact a significant contribution to the study of the emergent normative self-definition in Judaism and Christianity during the first centuries of the common era.</p><p></p><h2>Lonely Planet Istanbul (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet</i></b> <b><i>Istanbul</i> </b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

In this volume, forty of the world's leading analysts of international affairs provide innovative thinking about the relationship between political, social, and economic change and the outbreak and spread of conflict&#x2014;and what this means in practical terms.</p><p><b>Chester A. Crocker</b> is the James R. Schlesinger Professor of Strategic Studies at Georgetown University and a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innnovation (CIGI). His teaching and research focus on conflict management and regional security issues. He served as chairman of the board of the United States Institute of Peace (1992-2004) and as a board member for many years thereafter. From 1981-1989, he was U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs. As such, he was the principal diplomatic architect and mediator in the prolonged negotiations among Angola, Cuba, and South Africa that led to Namibia&#x2019;s transition to independence, and to the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. Dr. Crocker served as a staff officer at the National Security Council (1970-72) where he worked on Middle East, Indian Ocean, and African issues and director of African studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (1976-80). He serves on the boards Universal Corporation, Inc., a leading independent trading company in tobacco and agricultural products; Good Governance Group Ltd, a business intelligence advisory service; and Bell Pottinger USA, a communications and public relations firm.

Packinghouse Daughter also testifies to the hold that childhood experience has on personal values and notions of social class, despite the upward mobility that is the great promise of American democracy.</p><p>In 1959, meatpackers in the little Minnesota town of Albert Lea went on strike to demand better working conditions and higher rates of pay. The plant's owners brought in strikebreakers from nearby towns, violence ensued, the governor of Minnesota called in the National Guard, and for a few days news from Albert Lea filled papers around the United States.<p> The incident has long been forgotten, even by many local residents. Cheri Register, who was 14 years old at the time, is one who remembers it well. In this affecting memoir of working-class life, she pays homage to her father, who worked in the plant for 31 numbing years, earning 70 cents an hour when he started, a bit more than five dollars an hour when he retired. The work was dangerous and unpleasant, but still an improvement over the alternatives, for, as she writes, "My entire family failed at farming in one of the richest stretches of the corn belt, where water was so plentiful it had to be drained away and the soil so thick that geologists could find no exposed rock." </p><p> As she recounts the strike and her father's life, Register describes how the subsequent generational conflicts of the 1960s and her own aspirations divided her family. "To be successful," she writes, "which means free from grueling labor, the children of blue-collar families must be driven from home, away from the familiar and secure." Her book is both a homecoming and a welcome contribution to labor history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Cheri Register, in her lovely, deeply moving memoir, has done more than resurrect a buried history of America&#x2019;s laboring people; in this instance, the bitter 1959-60 Wilson &amp; Co. packinghouse strike in Albert Lea, Minn. At a time in which the two major party candidates for President appealed to the "middle class," as though there were no other, Register gives rebirth to an old honored phrase in our daily vocabulary: working class. Yes, she is a Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy), but to me and, I hope, scores of thousands of readers, she is a Ph.D. (Packinghouse Daughter). This is must reading, especially for the young who have so long been short-changed in the knowledge of labor history." -- Studs Terkel</p><h2>Driftwood Summer</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Patti Callahan Henry continues to spellbind readers in this rich and engaging novel of three sisters...their loves, their rivalries, and the events of one summer that change their lives.</b><br><br>In the small seaside town of Palmetto Beach, the Sheffield sisters&#x2014;responsible Riley, vivacious Maisy-Rose, and fun-loving Adelee&#x2014;reunite to save the family's beach-community bookstore.

For the creativity of his thinking, the originator of Archetypal Psychology and author of A Terrible Love of War; The Soul&#39;s Code; and The Force of Character has received many honors, including the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic. He has held distinguished lectureships at Yale, Princeton, Chicago, and Syracuse Universities, and his books have been translated into some twenty languages. The American public showed its appreciation of his approach to psychology by placing his book, The Soul&#39;s Code, at the top of the bestseller list of serious works of nonfiction. Of his many books, Spring Publications has published Anima, Loose Ends, Archetypal Psychology: A Brief Account, Pan and the Nightmare, Suicide and the Soul, Insearch, Oedipus Variations (with Karl Ker�nyi), The Thought of the Heart and the Soul of the World, Inter Views, and Lectures on Jung&#39;s Typology (with Marie-Louise von Franz). He lives in Connecticut.Insearch: Psychology and Religion is one of the few enduring descriptions of Jungian therapy in its relation to religion. In four insightful chapters (The Human Encounter, The Unconscious as Experience, The Inner Morality of the Shadow, and The Inner Feminine or Anima) James Hillman gives a comprehensive account of Jungian psychology. His examples are fresh, his language easy, and the evident pleasure he takes in opening the great questions of the soul make Insearch a basic text and seminal work, an introduction to psychotherapy and a consistently quoted reference for pastoral counseling. --<i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Not Dead Enough (Cal Claxton Mysteries, 4)</h2><p><p><strong>"Masterfully crafted... stunningly beautiful descriptions..." &#x2015;Anne Hillerman, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author</strong></p><p>The first closing of the floodgates of the mammoth Dalles Dam on the Columbia River inundated the sacred falls and the Native American village at Celilo which depended on the river's magnificent fish. Nelson Queah, Wasco Indian, war hero, and passionate opponent of the dam, watched helplessly as 10,000 years of tribal history and fishing tradition disappeared. That 1957 night, Nelson Queah vanished without a trace.</p><p>Fifty years later, attorney Cal Claxton, new to Portland after a career as a prosecutor in Los Angeles, attends a commemoration of the flooding of the falls at the behest of his friend, Philip Lone Deer, who introduces Cal to his cousin, Winona Cloud. Winona is Nelson Queah's granddaughter. Spurning the story of a witness at the time who claimed to have seen Queah drunk by the river, she reveals she's found a cache of letters at her grandmother's home, letters Queah wrote to his wife before he vanished. They suggest foul play, and not an accidental drowning.</p><p>Cal, still grieving over his own wife's suicide, agrees to check out the cold case. He locates the man who put out the drunk story and sets up an interview. When he arrives, he finds the man shot by a sniper. Cal gets a glimpse of the shooter and becomes a target himself.</p></p><p><p>Formerly a research scientist and international business executive, <strong>Warren C.

Easley's characters bring enough complex complications to keep you reading long after regular bedtime.<br>" - <strong><em> Anne Hillerman, New York Times bestselling author </em></strong><br><br>"The narrative spends much time absorbing sights and smells of the glorious outdoors and detailing the political fights they engender.... fans of Tony Hillerman and C. J. Box won't mind...Advise readers not to jump to that last page. Easley deserves his surprises.<br>" - <strong><em> Booklist</em></strong><br><br>"With a very likable sleuth, <i>Not Dead Enough</i> is sure to appeal not only to mystery lovers, but also to those interested in Native American history, Oregonian culture and environmental issues like salmon migration.

Blood drips down her fingers and lands with a smack on the cold floor of the church basement. She's trapped, bound, and petrified by fear. A knife punctures her fragile skin as Berkley's captors search for the mark of the devil on her body. They say they want to save her--drive the devil away and cleanse her soul--but will she make it out alive?<br><br>When Berkley arrived in Italy a week ago, the last thing she expected was that she'd end up fighting for her life. After spending six months at the Institute, confined to a room with the dangerous-yet-alluring Sofia Flores, Berkley was certain that a vacation in Italy with her two best friends would be the perfect getaway. But Berkley is hiding a terrible secret, one that threatens to undo everything. As she's forced to face her wicked past, she learns that the devil is always watching, and no one is coming to save her.</p><p><b>Danielle Vega</b> spent her childhood hiding under the covers while her mother retold tales from the pages of Stephen King novels.

As with other &#x201c;Merciless&#x201d; books, Vega brings a gleeful mean girl violence to the prose. Things between Berkley and her friends Harper and Mara are in trouble long before the epilogue, but the slow dissolution of their friendship paired with Berkley&#x2019;s burgeoning relationship with Giovanni makes for a fun read. The book is not for the faint of heart; a particular description of a rat gnawing on someone told from a first-person perspective comes to mind, but it&#x2019;s a delightfully horrific read for teens who love the macabre."--<i>School Library Journal</i></p><h2>Against All Enemies (A Paul Sinclair Novel)</h2><p><b>John G.

A white brother and sister build a record company that becomes a monument to racial harmony in 1960's segregated south Memphis. Their success is startling, and Stax soon defines an international sound. Then, after losses both business and personal, the siblings part, and the brother allies with a visionary African-American partner. Under integrated leadership, Stax explodes as a national player until, Icarus-like, they fall from great heights to a tragic demise. Everything is lost, and the sanctuary that flourished is ripped from the ground. A generation later, Stax is rebuilt brick by brick to once again bring music and opportunity to the people of Memphis. </p><p>Set in the world of 1960s and '70s soul music, <i>Respect Yourself</i> is a story of epic heroes in a shady industry. It's about music and musicians -- Isaac Hayes, Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Wilson Pickett, the Staple Singers, and Booker T. and the M.G.'s, Stax's interracial house band. It's about a small independent company's struggle to survive in a business world of burgeoning conglomerates. And always at the center of the story is Memphis, Tennessee, an explosive city struggling through heated, divisive years. </p><p>Told by one of our leading music chroniclers, <i>Respect Yourself</i> brings to life this treasured cultural institution and the city that created it.</p></p><p><b>Robert Gordon</b> has been writing about Memphis music and history for thirty years and is the author of <i>It Came from Memphis</i>, <i>Can't Be Satisfied</i>, <i>The King on the Road</i>, and <i>The Elvis Treasures</i>.

Originally published in 1997, Priscilla's Letter: Finding the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews was secretly taken out of print after only a few months of availability. Circumstances suggest deliberate suppression, due to the influence of religious extremists who regard the concept of female authorship of the epistle intolerable. Recognition of Priscilla's claim will advance the social and religious status of all women.<br><br>This scholarly examination of a long-debated New Testament mystery arques convincingly that a woman was the author of Hebrews.</p><p>RUTH HOPPIN lives in Daly City, a suburb of San Francisco, where she and her husband, Stuart, raised a family. Under the auspices of the DC History, Art, and Science Commission, Ruth coordinated a poetry and short story contest, which provided a forum for poets and writers who gathered to read their work at the annual awards ceremony. The Hoppins are parishioners at Holy Child &amp; St. Martin Episcopal Church, where Ruth leads a science and faith seminar and Bible discussion groups. She is author of Priscilla's Letter: Finding the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, a book in the field of New Testament studies that has been translated into Spanish, and she speaks and writes on this subject. Her interests include travel, studying French, and playing the recorder.<br><br>Gilbert Bilezikian (ThD, Boston University) is a professor emeritus of Wheaton College, a charter member and elder of Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Illinois, and the author of Community 101.Ruth Hoppin provides a compelling and convincing case that Priscilla is the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. It is an engaging read. She presents the evidence as an attorney would in front of a jury, the readers functioning as the jury.<br><br>Ruth brings in evidence from within the letter, from related writings in the Bible, from other literature of the time, archaeology (in particular the Dead Sea Scrolls, Qumran, and the Essene sect), politics, sociology, history, anthropology, psychology, religious practices, literary analysis, and early church traditions. She argues persuasively, discussing and then countering arguments that might be made against Priscilla as the author.<br><br>When all the evidence is laid out, the only author that fits the profile is Priscilla. <br><br>Why was the identity of the author "lost"? The author was "lost accidentally on purpose."<br><br>We don't have to go far in Christian history to understand why it was better, for the sake of broad acceptance of the letter, to hide the identity of the author.<br><br>I truly enjoyed reading this book. I happen to accept Ms. Hoppin's arguments, but even if you ultimately do not, there is much in here in regards to the society and history around the latter half of the first century AD that I did not know before and should prove useful in reading and interpreting other New Testament texts. --Rev. Mark Kubo, Petersburg, Alaska<br><br>A welcome challenge to accepted thought regarding the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Hoppin proposes that Priscilla wrote Hebrews. She supports her thesis with literary criticism, circumstantial evidence, and archeological finds. Her argument is both scholarly and persuasive. The book would appeal to feminists and to anyone researching the early church. I loved it! --Christine Winter, reviewer, amazon.co.uk<br><br>Is it possible that a particular identifiable woman wrote one of the epistles of the Christian scriptures? Ruth Hoppin demonstrates that it is not only possible but entirely probable that Priscilla, a prominent leader and teacher in the Pauline communities, wrote the letter to the Hebrews. With painstaking care Hoppin sifts through the details of the case, working through early Christian history and literature, linguistic puzzles, biblical scholarship, and psychological profile to unwind the mystery behind the authorship of Hebrews. One is drawn through the layers of her thought in a well-constructed discussion of the evidence that supports her hypothesis that Priscilla authored Hebrews.<br><br>Hoppin lays the groundwork by establishing the slate of possible authors, the psychology and gender identity of the author, details of the language disputed over the course of centuries, details about the community and times for which the letter was written, evidence of the author's relationship to Paul and other New Testament figures, and a detailed life history of her proposed author, Priscilla. Hoppin weaves the theology and literary sophistication of the letter throughout her analysis, and masterfully demonstrates how these aspects of the letter match well to Priscilla.<br><br>Hoppin's sleuthing begins with an analysis of the author's femininity and identification with women. The author's writing demonstrates aspects of traditional feminine expectations emblematic of the times. Hoppin finds that diplomacy is a hallmark of the epistle. The author remains deferent to the particularities of the community throughout. She or he manages smooth transitions between theological discourse and the personal expression of nurturing and concern for the community. It is also clear that the author identifies with women in a way that a male author would not. Hoppin notes the list of Israelite heroes, naming two women and implying several others who, she hypothesizes, would be invisible to a male writer.<br><br>Thus establishing the high possibility that the author was feminine, Hoppin goes on to eliminate the other candidates that have accumulated over centuries of scholarship. None, according to Hoppin's detailed and well-documented analysis is revealed to be as qualified as Priscilla. Finally Hoppin introduces us to Priscilla herself, a woman related to a noble family and highly educated as would befit her standing; a woman who was clearly a friend to Paul and possessed a deep understanding of his theology. Hoppin demonstrates Priscilla's proximity historically and geographically to the time and place where Hebrews, per the scholarship of many others, was written.<br><br>If Priscilla indeed did write Hebrews, this opens a window into the high level of women's involvement in the early church and strengthens the position of many that women were equitably involved on all levels of leadership and development. As the church struggles for its identity in modern times, scholars reach back to its origins seeking the authentic tradition to which the church seeks to trace its roots. Priscilla's authorship of Hebrews, clearly validated by Hoppin's exquisite scholarship, and made accessible as a result of her cogent writing, provides a clear rebuttal to those traditionalists who assert that women were, from the Church's inception, relegated to subordinate positions.<br><br>An accessible and engaging read, <i>Priscilla's Letter</i> is the book to purchase if one wants to round out his/her library of Christian scripture scholarship. It is available in Spanish under the title <i>La carta de Priscilla: encontrando el autor de la ep�stola a los hebreos</i>. Anyone seeking truth about women s original role in the Church, academic and lay leader alike, should read this book. --Christine Fahrenbach, Deacon, Roman Catholic Womenpriests for <i>Feminstas Unidas</i> newsletter, spring 2014</p><h2>The Rough Guide to Brittany &amp; Normandy (Travel Guide with Free eBook)</h2><p><p><strong>THE ROUGH GUIDE TO BRITTANY AND NORMANDY</strong><br><br><strong>Make the most of your time on Earth with the ultimate travel guides.</strong><br><strong>World-renowned 'tell it like it is' travel guide to Brittany and Normandy, now with free eBook.</strong><br><br>Discover Brittany and Normandy with this comprehensive and entertaining travel guide, packed with practical information and honest and independent recommendations by our experts.

Yanagita is best remembered as the founder of Japanese folklore studies, and Ronald Morse transcends time to bring the reader a marvelous guide to Tono, Yanagita, and his enthralling tales. In this 100th Anniversary edition, Morse has completely revised his original translation, now out of print for over three decades. Retaining the original's great understanding of Japanese language, history, and lore, this new edition will make the classic collection available to new generations of readers.</p><p><b>Ronald A. Morse</b> is a leading thinker and commentator on Japan.The various episodes selected from the countless field notes Yanagita took provide, from a literary point of view, a peerless model of conciseness. In his sentences can be found a perfect economy, his words used as sparingly as gold. (Yukio Mishima)<br><br>The Tono monogatari takes its place with the Kinder und Haus-M�rchen of the brothers Grimm as a landmark collection in the history of folklore studies...In making <i>The Legends of Tono</i> available in English translation Ronald Morse, the perceptive biographer of Yanagita-sensei, has placed Asian and folklore scholars in his debt. It deserves a wide attentive audience outside its own country to match the readership it has rightfully earned at home. (Richard M. Dorson)<br><br>There is magic on every page of Yanagita's 'Legends,' and it's very hard not to be seduced by this reissued, 100th anniversary translation.... This handsome new edition updates Morse's excellent but rare 1975 translation with a new preface and introduction.... It's a must-have for everyone who wants to know what the psycho-spiritual lives of rural Japanese were like a century ago. Tono stands proud as Japan's heart of darkness, and Yanagita is its best guide. (Tim Hornyak, 2009 <i>The Japan Times</i>)<br><br>The stories themselves are a collage of disparate elements coming together to create an overall feel of the area. It creates a real sense of place and time and feeling. (<i>Sci-Fi Japan, April 2010</i>)<br><br>That is the wonder of the Tono book. We are looking at tales in the making. Yanagita gives us a rare glimpse of story-telling as process, rather than product. (A. W. Sadler)</p><h2>Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen</h2><p>The gritty business of politics is not something we usually associate with the occult. But esoteric beliefs have influenced the destiny of nations since the time of ancient Egypt and China, when decisions of state were based on portents and astrology, to today, when presidents and prime ministers privately consult self-proclaimed seers. <i>Politics and the Occult</i> offers a lively history of this enduring phenomenon. Author and cultural pundit Gary Lachman provocativly questions whether the separation of church and state so dear to modern political philosophy should be maintained. A few of his fascinating topics include the fate of the Knights Templar and the medieval Gnostic Cathars, the occult roots of America and the French Revolution in Freemasonry, Gurdjieff and the swastika, Soviet interest in UFOs, the CIA and LSD, the Age of Aquarius, the millenarian politics that inform the struggle with Islamic terrorism, fundamentalism, and more.</p><p>Born in 1955, <b>Gary Lachman</b> is a former student of Gurdjieff's Fourth Way, as well as a counterculture expert. He published his first book, <i>Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties</i> and the <i>Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius</i>, in 2001, a history of the 1960s occult counterculture. During the 1980s, Gary avidly studied philosophy, psychology, history, science, and esotericism. He also traveled in Europe, visiting Chartres Cathedral, Stonehenge, as well as the site of Gurdjieff's prieure in Fontainbleau. From 1987 to 1993, he managed the renowned Bodhi Tree Bookstore in Los Angeles and helped start their catalogue. He has published several articles in the Pauper's Press Colin Wilson Studies Series and was the Science Writer for the University of California Los Angeles. He received recognition for composing music and playing bass guitar for the pop rock group Blondie. His public figure rose in the late 1970s as he toured with Blondie and earned three gold records for his award-winning song, "I'm Always Touched By Your Presence, Dear, which was a top-ten hit in Europe and the UK. His unique experience with the group was the subject of his 2002 book, <i>New York Rocker</i>. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Gary beca"me a full-time writer in 1996, when he moved London. He contributes to many journals in the US and UK including: <i>Times Literary Supplement; Literary Review; Fortean Times; Mojo; Bizarre</i>; and <i>Guardian</i>.

Wilson helped usher in the cultural revolution of the 1960s with his landmark work, <i>The Outsider</i>, published in 1956. <i>The Outsider</i> was an intelligent, meticulous, and unprecedented study of nonconformity in all facets of life. Wilson, finally, became a prolific and unparalleled historian of the occult, providing a generation of readers with a responsible and scholarly entry point to a world of mysteries. <br><br>Now, acclaimed historian Gary Lachman, a friend of Wilson and a scholar of his work, provides an extraordinary and delightful biography that delves into the life, thought, and evolution of one of the greatest intellectual rebels and underrated visionaries of the twentieth century.</p><p>GARY LACHMAN is the author of many books on consciousness, culture, and the Western esoteric tradition, including <i>Rudolf Steiner: An Introduction to His Life and Work; In Search of P. D. Ouspensky; A Secret History of Consciousness; Politics and the Occult;</i> and<i> The Quest for Hermes Trismegistus</i>. He writes for several journals in the US and UK and lectures on his work in the US, UK, and Europe. His books have been translated into more than a dozen languages and he has appeared in several radio and television documentaries. He is assistant professor in the Evolution of Consciousness at the California Institute of Integral Studies.

World War II had endedmore than a decade earlier, but the Britain the book appeared in was stillrecovering from the Blitz, rationing, and its demotion from an empire to asmall and rather fragile island nation. Bomb sites and shattered buildings werestill part of the London terrain, and Britain&#x2019;s fall in status was reflected inits cultural consciousness. In 1951 the Festival of Britain, dedicated totechnology and innovation, tried hard to kick-start a sense of recovery, butthe response was sluggish and the doldrums that had settled over the ScepteredIsle seeped into every aspect of its life, including its literary one.1 Theoutlook there was pretty bleak.2 The end of World War I had seen the rise of anew generation of writers. Figures such as T.&nbsp;S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf,Aldous Huxley, James Joyce, and D.&nbsp;H. Lawrence had emerged from theaftermath of the &#x201c;war to end all wars,&#x201d; and their grim determination to &#x201c;tellthe truth&#x201d; and depict &#x201c;reality&#x201d; made the previous generation of writers seemhopelessly outdated. Bernard Shaw, H.&nbsp;G. Wells, G. K. Chesterton, andothers from the Edwardian era were still writing, but the optimism andprogressive thinking that had characterized what I have called the &#x201c;positivefin de si�cle&#x201d; now rang hollow and it was clear that the new crew wasrepresentative of an unmistakable change in sensibilities.3</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten years afterVictory in Europe and Hiroshima, nothing similar had happened, at least not inBritain, and the epigone of the first wave of modernism seemed to have settledinto producing good but not particularly exciting work. Cyril Connolly, one ofthe most influential critics of the time, placed the blame on James Joyce&#x2019;sforbidding monster Ulysses, which, Connolly argued, was a very tough act tofollow, something Joyce discovered for himself when he produced Finnegans Wake,which, for all its puns, mythology, and linguistic hijinks, was not what onecould call a novel. Joyce, it seemed, had taken the novel as far as it couldgo, and there appeared to be little left for those who came after him to do,even himself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This sense ofanticlimax and reduced expectations most likely played a part in thevertiginous success of a book that, in one sense, should not have beensuccessful at all. Not that it wasn&#x2019;t good or didn&#x2019;t deserve the acclaim itreceived. But as its author soon found out, most of the hue and cry the bookprompted was for the wrong reasons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The book was TheOutsider and its author, a twenty-four-year-old Leicester lad named ColinWilson, was an unlikely candidate for celebrity, more like what used to becalled a &#x201c;high school dropout.&#x201d; For the past several years Wilson had driftedfrom job to job, tramping across England and France, often doing cheap manuallabor, and at one point he was so insolvent that he had taken to sleeping roughon London&#x2019;s bucolic Hampstead Heath, to escape paying rent, but also to avoidthe payments he was obliged to make to his estranged wife for the maintenanceof their son.4 He was, in his own words, &#x201c;a bum and a drifter,&#x201d; whooccasionally had encounters with the police; at least one policeman had toldhim that it was illegal to sleep in England without a roof over one&#x2019;s head.5Wilson did not have the benefit of a university education, something most ofBritain&#x2019;s literati had, and his tousled hair, turtleneck sweater, and generalunkempt appearance were not standard issue for upcoming British writers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And if theauthor was not cut from the expected literary cloth, his book certainly wasn&#x2019;teither. The Outsider, a work of literary and philosophical analysis, wasconcerned with the spiritual dilemmas of an eclectic and somewhat incongruouscollection of characters. This angst-ridden group included the philosopherFriedrich Nietzsche, whose misappropriation by the Nazis had given him a badreputation in English-speaking countries; the dancer and choreographer VaslavNijinsky, who had died insane in London just a few years earlier; the militaryhero T.&nbsp;E. Lawrence of Arabia; the painter and suicide Vincent van Gogh;the French philosopher, novelist, and playwright Jean-Paul Sartre, at the timeprobably the most famous writer in the world; and forgotten figures such as theplaywright Harley Granville-Barker. Others included were H. G. Wells, FyodorDostoyevsky, and Leo Tolstoy. There were also some unfamiliar names, such asthe German novelist Hermann Hesse, who was practically unknown in England atthe time; and the Greek-Armenian esoteric teacher G.&nbsp;I. Gurdjieff, who hada bad reputation for taking A. R. Orage away from his proper work as a literaryeditor and for somehow being responsible for the death of the New Zealandwriter Katherine Mansfield.6 What all these individuals and others had incommon is that they all exemplified a character type that Wilson identified as&#x201c;the Outsider.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Who or what isthe Outsider?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A more detailedanswer to this question will be found in the pages that follow. But for now wecan say that the Outsider is someone who sees &#x201c;too deep and too much&#x201d; and thatmost of what he sees is &#x201c;chaos.&#x201d;7 He or she lives in the world with a sense of&#x201c;strangeness&#x201d; and &#x201c;unreality.&#x201d; The safe, stable reality that most of usperceive is for the Outsider an illusion, a facade obscuring a more dangerousand threatening possibility: that of nothingness, nihilism, and the void, thecomplete inconsequentiality of human life and all its achievements. For theOutsider, the values and meanings that constitute life for most people&#x2014;a goodjob, a big home, a nice bank account&#x2014;are empty and makeshift; they are, atbest, &#x201c;attempts to gloss over, to make look civilized and rational somethingthat is savage, unorganized, irrational.&#x201d;8 That is to say, for the Outsider,most people&#x2019;s lives are inauthentic, based on untruths and the avoidance ofreality. But the Outsider &#x201c;stands for Truth.&#x201d;9 He stands for Reality. He seeksa meaning and purpose that the everyday world cannot provide and his salvationlies in understanding this and embracing it with total conviction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Other namesappear in Wilson&#x2019;s heterogeneous mix, but by now the reader should have an ideaof what reviewers, cracking open their copy of The Outsider, would have confronted.Although the sun never set on the English empire&#x2014;at least not until after WorldWar II&#x2014;its cultural, literary, and philosophical tastes were often parochialand insular. The English were also notoriously impervious to ideas&#x2014;their forteis pragmatism&#x2014;and if there was one thing The Outsider was full of, it wasideas.10 That a book that declared that &#x201c;the Outsider cannot live in thecomfortable insulated world of the bourgeois&#x201d; and that &#x201c;it is as impossible toexercise freedom in an unreal world as it is to jump while you are falling&#x201d;skyrocketed to the best-seller list has to be one of the great ironies ofmodern literature.11 Another is that the success this irony achieved woulddrive its author, if not into exile, certainly into a kind of literary no-man&#x2019;sland which he would escape only through much hard work, determination, andsheer brute endurance. Such a fate might have crushed most beginners, but theauthor of The Outsider was, as you might expect, an Outsider himself, and theyears leading up to his paradoxical success were ones of effort, challenge, andthe difficult business of actualizing one&#x2019;s freedom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin HenryWilson&#x2014;he never used his middle name in any literary work&#x2014;was born into aworking-class Leicester family in England&#x2019;s Midlands on June 26, 1931. TheDepression had hit Great Britain by then and needless to say times were tough.The effects of World War I were still felt throughout the United Kingdom, andthe worldwide economic slump only added to an already difficult situation.Wilson&#x2019;s father worked long hard hours in a boot and shoe factory earninglittle more than three pounds a week, roughly twelve dollars at the time. Itwas a barely livable wage. Although Wilson says his family&#x2014;there were laterbrothers and a sister&#x2014;was never really deprived, there were times when themoney was short, and on at least one occasion the young Wilson had no food forhis school lunch break.12</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilson candidlyadmits that he was the reason his parents married; neither really wanted to buthis mother&#x2019;s pregnancy forced the issue.13 He also admits that he didn&#x2019;t reallylike his father, but acknowledges that he was a &#x201c;hard worker and goodbreadwinner.&#x201d; Yet the fact that &#x201c;working a forty-eight-hour week&#x201d; must havestruck his father as &#x201c;a poor substitute for living&#x201d; must have had something todo with the eventual Outsider&#x2019;s desire to escape the dreary treadmill ofeveryday life, its endless routines and repetitions.14 It was a fate thatpractically everyone around the young Outsider shared. &#x201c;No one dreamed ofescape,&#x201d; he later remarked about the people in his childhood, &#x201c;because no onethought there was any escape. Instead they contented themselves with the pub,and the football match on Saturday afternoon, and dreamed of winning thefootball pools.&#x201d;15 Most everyone around him was satisfied with this, but froman early age, Wilson had other dreams.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilson&#x2019;s fatherwas bad-tempered and irritable&#x2014;not surprising, given he had been forced intomarriage in his late teens&#x2014;and he and Wilson&#x2019;s mother often quarreled. Onoccasion this led to blows.16 Wilson&#x2019;s father consoled himself, as many otherfathers did, by spending evenings at the pub drinking beer. Wilson admitseveryone at home was relieved when Dad left for the pub, but the drinking did cutinto the family finances. Wilson says that the first sentence he wrote was &#x201c;Daddrinks beer,&#x201d; an achievement about which his father was not happy.17</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilson&#x2019;s motherwas different; in fact the two hardly seemed suited to each other. His fatherwas sentimental and emotionally turbulent, his mother cool and detached, adifficult mix that in Wilson produced a dedicated family man who was given tosudden demonstrations of affection, yet who also needed solitude and who couldappear to those who didn&#x2019;t know him as aloof and withdrawn. To compensate forher unhappy home life, Wilson&#x2019;s mother read magazines such as True Romance, butalso novels by D.&nbsp;H. Lawrence and A.&nbsp;J. Cronin&#x2014;famous in his day forThe Citadel&#x2014;which she borrowed from the local library. She was an intelligentwoman who daydreamed of a better life, and would share her woes anddissatisfaction with Colin and his brother Barry as she got through her chores.Wilson would later write, &#x201c;I have long suspected that imaginative working-classwomen are the evolutionary spearhead of society, since the narrowness of theirlives imparts an intensity to their daydreams that middle- and upper-classwomen, lacking the desperation, find harder to achieve.&#x201d;18</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilson&#x2019;smother&#x2019;s daydreams of a more rewarding existence communicated themselves to theyoung Colin and her response to unhappiness served as a counter to his father&#x2019;sbitterness at an impoverished existence. The &#x201c;narrowness&#x201d; of her life impartingan &#x201c;intensity&#x201d; to her daydreams is an example of Wilson&#x2019;s belief that adverseconditions may often be of more value to a creative person than more ostensiblynurturing environments. Two of Wilson&#x2019;s heroes, Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells,had been born into impoverished families and had to overcome many obstacles anddifficulties in their early years before achieving any kind of success. Theirearly struggles ensured that they would not balk at later challenges, andinstilled in them an optimism and drive based on a vivid awareness of the valueof the things they fought for. They were inoculated against the kind ofpessimism and spoiled-ness that, Wilson believed, is often associated with aneasy life in which everything is handed to you. The novelist Marcel Proust andthe playwright Samuel Beckett, for example&#x2014;two writers Wilson often refersto&#x2014;both came from well-off families. Proust was a notorious hypochondriac andBeckett developed a numbingly pessimistic vision of life, depicted in painfullystatic plays such as Endgame. This belief in the power of early effort tominimize pessimism and despair plays a central role in Wilson&#x2019;s philosophy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet Wilson alsoadmits that &#x201c;the most essential fact about my childhood is that I wasspoiled.&#x201d;19 By this he means he was the darling of his extended family. Hismother was the first of many brothers and sisters to produce a grandchild andyoung Colin was doted on by his grandparents, aunts, and uncles. His maternalgrandparents regarded him as &#x201c;altogether remarkable,&#x201d; a conviction that he cameto share. He was told that he was &#x201c;pretty&#x201d; and &#x201c;clever&#x201d; and that great thingsmust be in store for him. This fuss and adulation instilled in the young Wilson&#x201c;a certain basic conviction that life and fortune mean well by me,&#x201d; an optimismand certainty of success that both buoyed him and led to later friction withhis critics, who found his frank assessment of his own powers and abilities tooforthright for their tastes, especially coming from an Englishman.20 For theEnglish, good upbringing should root out &#x201c;any element of what might appear tobe self-assertion or egoism,&#x201d; with the result that one develops an instinct to&#x201c;suppress any stirring of impatience or originality. . . . Good manners,&#x201d; inthis case, means &#x201c;to be like everyone else,&#x201d; a difficult assignment for an up-and-comingOutsider.21</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The praiseWilson received led to him getting used to &#x201c;being the strongest, and toexerting a certain authority over my brothers and cousins.&#x201d;22 It also later ledto him &#x201c;thinking of myself as a prodigy.&#x201d;23 And although he soon realized thathe was &#x201c;not half the prodigy I thought I was,&#x201d; it was just as well he wasn&#x2019;tdisillusioned, as it preserved him from the &#x201c;fallacy of insignificance,&#x201d; theprevailing idea that human beings are humble, unexceptional creatures whosepotentialities are severely limited, a belief Wilson would take exception to inThe Age of Defeat, his book about the &#x201c;loss of the hero.&#x201d;24 It also led to himbecoming something of a performer. He learned to recite poems and sing songsand was often put up on a table to entertain the family. Looking back, Wilsonis amazed at the kind of confidence he displayed then, compared to theexcruciating shyness and reserve that colored his teens. But the adulation feda self-confidence not yet undermined by the doubt and self-division he wouldlater struggle with. It was responsible for &#x201c;occasions on which I wanted to dosomething, and have done it with an ease that has astonished me&#x2014;an ease that issomehow foreign to the subjective and introspective part of me.&#x201d;25 Self-division,the quarrel between two opposing visions of ourselves, became one of thecentral themes of Wilson&#x2019;s later work. In his early years this took the form of&#x201c;two opposing impulses: distrust of the world, and the sense of immunity,complete confidence.&#x201d;26</p></p><h2>The Sense of the Call: A Sabbath Way of Life for Those Who Serve God, the Church, and the World</h2><p>Why is it <i>so hard</i> to serve God these days? Church workers suffer from low morale, while Christians of all stripes struggle to find their way in a culture fixated on sexuality, violence, and wealth. In <i>Keeping the Sabbath Wholly</i> (1989) Marva Dawn introduced the vital Sabbath aspects of <i>resting, ceasing, feasting,</i> and <i>embracing.</i> Now, in <i>The Sense of the Call,</i> she expands these into a way of life for serving God and the Kingdom every single day of the week.<br><br>A Sabbath way of life, Dawn asserts, consists of <i>resting</i> in the Kingdom's grace, <i>ceasing</i> by grace those attitudes and actions that hinder the Kingdom, <i>feasting</i> so as to radiate the grace-full splendor of the Kingdom, and <i>embracing</i> the Kingdom's gracious purposes. To this end Dawn teaches skills such as learning to rest in prayer, saying no to busyness, enjoying one's body as God's temple, and embracing the cost of living as a Christian disciple.<br><br>Both frank and compassionate, <i>The Sense of the Call</i> will guide Christian servants into a more restful, joy-full life of trust in God.</p><p>Marva J. Dawn is a theologian, author, musician, andeducator with Christians Equipped for Ministry, Vancouver,Washington, and Teaching Fellow in Spiritual Theology atRegent College. A scholar with four masters degrees and aPh.D. in Christian Ethics and the Scriptures from theUniversity of Notre Dame, Dr. Dawn has spoken for clergyand worship conferences and seminaries throughout NorthAmerica and in Madagascar and in Eastern and WesternEurope. She has written many books, most of which arepublished by Eerdmans.<b>Academy of Parish Clergy</b>,&nbsp;<i>Top Ten Books of the Year</i>&nbsp;(2007)<br><br><b><i>Presbyterian Record</i></b><br> "Last summer when I heard Marva Dawn preach in Toronto, I saw a frail human being &#x2014; physically. But there was nothing frail about her reading of Scripture and her preaching. The biblical text leapt off the page and inspired a kind of gospel-fuelled courage to be the church. . . Dawn has a profound sense of call, not only for herself but also for the church which, in so many ways, has a frailty not always acknowledged."<br><br><b><i>Prism</i></b><br> "<i>The Sense of the Call</i>&nbsp;is packed with Bible studies, illustrations from church history, and personal anecdotes, all geared to convince readers of their need to be regularly reclaimed, revitalized, and renewed."<br><br><b>Eugene H. Peterson</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>The Message</i><br> "Inch by inch, row by row . . . Marva Dawn patiently (but not complacently!) works in the garden of God, this planting of sinner-saints in which we live and grow. She waters and weeds, cultivating holy and wise lives. She works at the center, where Jesus is at work with us. There is not a trivial or superfluous word in this book. Dawn is insistent and winsome &#x2014; an American prophet."<br><b>Mark Buchanan</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>The Rest of God</i><br> "What a holy oddity Marva Dawn is. She juggles the prophetic with the pragmatic, stern warning with giddy invitation, a scholar's exactitude with a child's whimsy. She embodies both human brokenness and divine transformation, writing about both with level calm and quiet authority. Mostly she sees &#x2014; clear-eyed and unflinching &#x2014; the sheer madness of our mere busyness, and she calls us back to the ancient rhythm of Sabbath keeping and, through that, the discovery that the kingdom is among us and has been for a long time."<br><br><b>Edith M. Humphrey</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>Ecstasy and Intimacy</i><br> "<i>The Sense of the Call</i>&nbsp;issues both a timely challenge and a ceaseless invitation. . . With conviction and concreteness, Marva Dawn leads us to embrace the gifts of God, the catholic disciplines and teachings of the Church, and the mission of our passionate God, who calls us to participate in the Kingdom and the priesthood. Even where the reader may disagree with her particular diagnosis of ills in Church or society, Dawn consistently and graciously points us toward the One who is the source and fulfillment of all authentic life in the Spirit. Above all, she recalls the Joy that is showered upon those who, in service and restful celebration, find their sustenance in the triune God."</p><h2>The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity</h2><p><p>"Evil&#x2015;the infliction of pain upon sentient beings&#x2015;is one of the most long-standing and serious problems of human existence. Frequently and in many cultures evil has been personified. This book is a history of the personification of evil, which for the sake of clarity I have called 'the Devil.' I am a medievalist, but when I began some years ago to work with the concept of the Devil in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, I came to see that I could not understand the medieval Devil except in terms of its historical antecedents. More important, I realized that I could not understand the Devil at all except in the context of the problem of evil.

Jeffrey Burton Russell probes the roots of the idea of evil, treats the development of the idea in the Ancient Near East, and then examines the concept of the Devil as it was formed in late Judaism and early Christianity.</p><p>Generously illustrated with fifty black-and-white photographs, this book will appeal to a wide range of readers, from specialists in religion, theology, sociology, history, psychology, anthropology, and philosophy to anyone with an interest in the demonic, the supernatural, and the question of good and evil.</p></p><p>This lively and learned book traces the history of the concept of evil from its beginnings in ancient times to the period of the New Testament.

This young Jewish couple&#x2014;he a graduate student in theater, and she a doctor&#x2014;was poor but resolute. Risking their own lives and relying on false papers, the Abadis hid Jewish children in Catholic schools and convents and with Protestant families. In 1943, their clandestine organization&#x2014;the Marcel Network&#x2014;became one of the most successful operations of Jewish resistance in Europe. By the end of the war, 527 children owed their survival to the Abadis. Yet their improbable success came with almost unspeakable sacrifice. As an example of what just two people of good will can accomplish in the face of crimes against humanity, the Abadis' story is a lesson in moral and physical courage. Drawn from a multitude of sources, including hundreds of documents in the Abadis' archives and dozens of interviews with the now grown children they rescued, Fred Coleman tells the Abadis' full story for the first time. <i>The Marcel Network</i> also breaks historic ground, and reveals how the Catholic Church, French Christians, and Jews themselves did far more to save Jewish lives than is generally known.</p><p>Fred Coleman&#x2019;s long career as a foreign correspondent included five years as <i>Newsweek</i>&#x2019;s bureau chief in Paris and eight years as the magazine&#x2019;s bureau chief in Moscow. In 1978 he won the Page 1 Award of the Newspaper Guild of New York for the best reporting from abroad for magazines. His first book, <i>The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Empire</i>, was published &#x2019;in 1996. Coleman and his wife, Nadine, live in Paris."There are thrilling fiction stories about World War II, but here an American journalist living in France has located a thriller that engages reality."<b>&#x2014;Book of the Month Club</b> (<i>Book of the Month Club</i>)<br><br>"This is a book you won't want to miss."&#x2014;Marcia W. Posner, <i>Jewish Book World</i> (Marcia W. Posner <i>Jewish Book World</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In times of great evil, great good can be born. <i>The Marcel Network</i> tells one such extraordinary story, that of two young Jews who saved 527 Jewish children in Nazi-occupied France from likely arrest and deportation for no other reason than that they could not stand by and do nothing. As Fred Coleman vividly recounts, Moussa Abadi and Odette Rosenstock never considered themselves heroes. And after the war, they sought no recognition for their work. Now, almost seven decades later, thanks to <i>The Marcel Network</i>, they can take their place in history as shining examples of the courage people can show when they dare to look horror in the face.&#x201d;&#x2014;Alan Riding, author of <i>And The Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-Occupied Paris</i> (Alan Riding)<br><br>&#x201c;Fred Coleman proves that it is still possible to unearth a gripping, previously untold story from the Holocaust. While focusing on a remarkable Jewish couple who saved 527 children in France, he also highlights the courage of those Catholics and Protestants who were critical to their success. <i>The Marcel Network</i> demonstrates that not even the Germans and their French collaborators could stamp out the best of the human spirit. A truly inspiring tale.&#x201d;&#x2014;Andrew Nagorski, author of <i>Hitlerland: American Eyewitnesses to the Nazi Rise to Power</i> (Andrew Nagorski)<br><br>&#x201c;Readers, whether Holocaust scholars or beginning students, will find <i>The Marcel Network</i> a compelling, often gripping tale. It is remarkable for its immediacy and comprehensiveness.&#x201d;&#x2014;Frederick M. Schweitzer, professor emeritus of history and founder of the Holocaust Center, Manhattan College (Frederick M.

It evokes the poignancy of wartime trauma that even its heroes wanted to forget&#x2014;a network run by Jews hiding children from the Holocaust with the help of priests, nuns, pastors, ordinary believers, and a patriotic French Catholic bishop who refused to follow the lead of his pope.

Miraculously, 1,218 men, women and children survived, but the disaster was catastrophic at home. <br><br> <i>Oil and Ice</i> is the story of one fateful whaling season that illuminates the unprecedented rise and devastating fall of America's first oil economy, and the fate of today's petroleum industry.</p><p>Product Description<p></p> In the summer of 1871, thirty-two whaling ships, carrying 12-year-old William Fish Williams, son of a whaling captain, and 1,218 other men, women, and children, were destroyed in an Arctic ice storm. In a rescue operation of unparalleled daring and heroism, not a single life was lost, but the impact on America's first oil industry was fateful and catastrophic. <br><br> The harvesting of whale oil, which grew from occasional beachcombing into a multi-million dollar industry, made New Bedford, Massachusetts, the wealthiest town in the world. Quaker brothers George and Matthew Howland, the town's leading whaling merchants, believed they were toiling in a pact with God. As whale oil lubricated the industrial revolution and turned New Bedford into the Saudi Arabia of its day, this belief only grew stronger. But as their whaleships pushed ever farther into uncharted seas in putsuit of a fast-diminishing resource, this oil business was overtaken by new paradigms. When the search for cheaper energy sources produced a new and apparently inexhaustible resource--petroleum oil--the Howlands and many others did not see the change coming, or the devastating effect it would have on an industry that has flourished for two centuries. Almost overnight, it seemed, the world changed. Business and financial institutions collapsed. The Howland brothers saw their fortune vanish and ended their lives as paupers. <br><br> For Willie Fish Williams, and the whalers and their families in the Arctic who watched as their floating community was crushed by the ice closing around them, that change came more swiftly. <br><br> Drawing on previously unpublished material, <i>Final Voyage</i> splices together two compelling narratives: the Howland brothers' unprecedented rise and sudden fall with the fortunes of America's first oil industry--which eerily prefigures today's modern economic collapse-- and a 12-year-old boy's vivid observation of a maritime disaster set against the world's harshest seascape. <br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Peter Nichols on the Collapse of the World's First Oil Industry</strong> <p> </p><p> As I was completing <i>Final Voyage</i> in the fall of 2008, the domino effect of the world's collapsing economies had begun. It was startling to read daily accounts of financial disasters, of the sudden impoverishment of wealthy institutions and financiers, while writing of the same process taking place one hundred and thirty years earlier.</p> <p> <i>Final Voyage</i> is in part about the collapse of the world's first oil industry - the whale oil business - and the fall from staggering wealth of the Howland brothers, Matthew and George Jr, of New Bedford, Massachusetts. For much of the 19th century, New Bedford was the Houston of the oil world, and the Howlands were its pre-eminent whaleship owners and oil merchants. At a time when the President of the United States' salary was $25,000, the Howlands were netting around $200,000 annually, with no income tax to pay.</p> <p> Like many, then and now, they didn't see what was coming. They wouldn't admit or recognize the inherent instability in their market or its resources, and when the collapse came, they were unprepared.</p> <p> After the fall of Lehman Brothers, in September of last year, it was impossible for me not to hear exactly the tone behind the words Matthew Howland wrote in letters to his family: "Hastings has failed." Hastings and Company was a New Bedford whale oil and candle manufacturer, one of the long-term bedrock commercial institutions of the town and its industry. The Howlands, along with many others, were deeply involved in its business and financial health, and they were devastated when Hastings went under. The failure sent shockwaves through their community, yet still the Howlands held fast and continued whaling.</p> <p> "The business of America is business" said President Calvin Coolidge in the 1920s. This was as true in the 1880s, the Howlands' time, as it is now. To men like Matthew and George Jr, who defined themselves and their lives by business, failure, insolvency, and finally the complete ruin that overtook them in the space of a decade, was accompanied by a shame akin to moral transgression. Both died paupers, bankrupt.</p> <p> Matthew's son, William Howland, made a good start as a textile manufacturer, but when his business also failed, he committed suicide. His son, Llewellyn Howland, had to leave Harvard after a single semester. A lifetime later, Llewellyn described to his grandson - Matthew's great-great grandson, Llewellyn Howland III - how he felt on being forced to withdraw from college because there was no more money for his education: "It was a nasty April day, raining, grey, bitter. I looked out of the train window and saw the old men picking through garbage in South Boston, and the ragged children playing in the streets. God! how it frightened me. The squalor of it, the hopelessness of being poor." The sight held a spectral terror for a Howland that was passed down through generations. "Don't ever forget," Llewellyn told his grandson, "how hard it is to rise, when you're really, truly down." </p> <br><b>Peter Nichols</b>, in addition to his sailing adventures, has worked in the film business as a screenwriter, propmaker, and ship-wrangler.

Grain. Manure. Those were useful, reliable things a woman with any amount of good sense chose to fill her life with. Anything of a more untoward or unnerving nature was obviously something that same sort of woman should avoid like a pile of mouldy oats.<br><br> L�irsinn of S�raichte stood in the shadows of a rather disreputable-looking pub, shivered, and made a valiant effort to focus on those things that had made up so much of her life so far. Horses were majestic creatures, grain kept them happy, and cleaning up after them was the price she'd paid for the joy of riding on their backs. It was a simple, predictable circle that had given purpose and meaning to her days. How she had strayed so far from such a pedestrian life, she couldn't say-<br><br> She sighed and stopped herself from even finishing that thought. She knew exactly how she'd come to be where she was and how barn work had led her to such a terrible place. It wasn't something she particularly wanted to think about, but she was trapped where she was for the moment and she needed something to help her pass the time. It seemed like the least dangerous of the things she could be doing, so she made herself more comfortable against the outside of the pub and allowed her thoughts to wander.<br><br> They wandered without much effort to the moment when her life had become something so thoroughly not what she'd been accustomed to. There she'd been, innocently going about her chores as usual, when a man had arrived at her uncle's barn looking for work. What she should have done was take away the pitchfork he quite obviously had never used and shown him the quickest way out of the barn.<br><br> Instead, she'd stared just a bit too long at his truly spectacular visage and apparently lost all her wits. Not only had she allowed him to remain in her uncle's stables attempting work he was singularly unqualified to do, she had listened to him long enough to be convinced that her uncle wanted her dead and her only hope was to flee. She had somehow lost her grip on good sense and traded the three things she knew best for other, less comfortable things such as mages, magic, and mythical beasts.<br><br> A breathless race across the whole of the Nine Kingdoms in the company of a madman and a shapechanging horse-two horses actually, but who was counting?-had left her standing where she was at present, trying not to gape at her surroundings like the country mouse she most definitely was and wishing she were safely tucked away in an obscure barn.<br><br> Where she was at present was E�las, the capital city of the country of Diarmailt. She hadn't dared ask anyone to verify her location, though she likely could have given that most of the inhabitants of the Nine Kingdoms were on the same cobblestone byway with her. Never in her life had she seen so many people gathered together in one place.<br><br> To make matters worse, most of those souls seemed determined to either elbow her out of their way or grope various parts of her person as they passed by her, no doubt in search of valuables.<br><br> She frowned at a particularly irritating lad who seemed determined to pester her, but she wasn't sure what the rules were for ridding oneself of that sort of vexation. She thought a hearty shove or perhaps even a fist to the lad's nose might be the easiest way to make her wishes known, but she was unfortunately under an injunction to do whatever was necessary not to draw attention to herself.<br><br> "A bit of ale," the young man said, looking at her meaningfully, "then perhaps a quiet moment or two in a-"<br><br> "Ditch?" suggested a deep voice from directly behind him. "Or perhaps you would care to select a less comfortable final resting place."<br><br> The lad turned, squeaked, then fled.<br><br>L�irsinn&nbsp;understood. She looked at the tall, cloaked figure now standing where her would-be companion had recently stood and supposed that if she'd had any sense, she would have bolted as well. The man facing her, while terribly elegant, gave the impression that a good brawl was something he indulged in each morning just after sunrise and just before helping himself to a hearty breakfast.<br><br> Fortunately for her, he was her traveling companion and deliverer of the occasional bit of maudlin sentiment. If he also happened to be the youngest bastard son of the worst black mage in recent memory, well, she wasn't going to complain. He was sitting on her side of the table instead of sitting across from her and spewing spells at her. She didn't think she could ask for anything more than that, though she did snort silently at how freely thoughts of magic galloped across what was left of her mind.<br><br> Spells. What absolute rot.<br><br> She turned away from indulging in those thoroughly useless thoughts and focused on the man standing in front of her. Acair of Ceangail shoved aside another gangly youth, then joined her in leaning against the pub wall, as far out of the press of humanity as possible.<br><br> "Any trouble?" he asked.<br><br> "Nothing noteworthy," she said, "though I'm probably not the right one to judge that." She glanced at him. "I've never seen so many people in one place in my life and 'tis only dawn."<br><br> He pushed his hood back from his face. "It is an easy place in which to lose oneself, true. In your case, though, I can see why nothing would aid you in escaping the attentions of every lad in the area."<br><br> She ignored the flattery, mostly because the memory of their thoroughly unpleasant journey to their current locale was still very fresh in her mind and he was responsible for it. "Did hiding your face help you in the past quarter hour?"<br><br> "Barely," he said, straightening his cloak. "I vow I was accosted by no fewer than half a dozen maids with mischief on their minds."<br><br> "Good thing you're accustomed to it," she observed.<br><br> "Isn't it, though?"<br><br> She suppressed the urge to roll her eyes. She imagined he was very accustomed to the same and she further supposed he had rarely passed up an opportunity to indulge as many lassies in their desires as possible. Given that she had experienced his powers of persuasion firsthand, she knew those poor women weren't to blame for whatever straits they found themselves in.<br><br> She could scarce believe she had been just as overcome, but the man was hard to resist. He was also, as she had reminded herself just a moment or two ago, completely to blame for the terror-filled journey she'd made on the back of her favorite horse to places she'd never intended to go, where she had encountered people of various sorts she had never imagined existed-<br><br> "You're thinking pleasant thoughts about me," Acair murmured, leaning closer to her. "Planning on joining that list of my admirers?"<br><br> "I was actually wishing I had stabbed you with a pitchfork the first time I saw you," she managed.<br><br> He smiled, and she winced. She realized at that moment that it had been his smile to render her not only witless but unable to do him any serious bodily harm. The first time she'd clapped eyes on him, she should have clapped her hand over her own traitorous eyes and stumbled away to somewhere he wasn't.<br><br> "You aren't in earnest," he said with a small smile. "Do damage to this extremely fine form? I don't think you could."<br><br> "I'm not sure you want to test it after what you put me through last night," she said, trying to ignore the memories of that extremely bumpy ride on the back of a dragon who had seemed determined by his antics to wring shouts of laughter from the madman standing next to her. She dredged up the sternest look she could muster and attempted an abrupt return to the business at hand. "What now?" she asked. "Well, besides watching you step over the pile of lassies who have fallen at your feet, did you find anything unexpected?"<br><br> He propped his foot up underneath him and sighed. "Nothing out of the ordinary, which bodes well for success here. Unfortunately, that leaves us with nothing to do but continue to keep ourselves out of trouble whilst we wait for a certain finicky prince of Neroche to locate the sort of accommodations he might find to his liking, then we run away from them as quickly as possible and find something suitable."<br><br> "And then?" she asked. "I know you told me yesterday, but I spent so much time screaming last night that I believe the noise drove it from my mind."<br><br> He bumped her companionably with his shoulder. "You didn't scream the entire time."<br><br> "Nay, I fainted midway through the torment, which likely saved your ears."<br><br> He smiled. "I thought you were swooning for my benefit, so I'm not sure I'll accept anything else." He watched the shadowy press of humanity for a bit longer, then looked at her. "We'll find somewhere safe to leave our gear, then I need to nip in and out of the library and fetch that book I need."<br><br> She knew that, of course. She'd simply been hoping her ears had been failing her. Traveling to their current locale seemed like a great deal of fuss for not much at all. "You couldn't have found a copy of this book somewhere else?"<br><br> He opened his mouth, then shut it and shook his head. "Nay, though you've no idea how it pains me to say as much. The damned thing is of my own make, unfortunately, and whilst I usually make at least one copy of my notes to hide elsewhere, in this instance I was in a hurry and therefore less careful than I should have been." He shrugged. "I would prefer not to be here, but here we are."<br><br> She was tempted to ask him why he didn't just stash things under his bed, but for all she knew, he didn't have a bed, never mind a home to call his own. Perhaps he was forced to hide his priceless treasures in odd places just to keep them safe. Given that he seemed to endlessly travel the world, she wouldn't have been surprised.<br><br> The idea that she might travel the world in a similar fashion had honestly never occurred to her. In fact, if anyone had suggested the possibility of it to her even a pair of months before, she would have stabbed <i>them</i> with a pitchfork to give them relief from their stupidity. Getting herself even from her uncle's stables in Bri�ghde across the hill to S�raichte, nothing more than a leisurely hour's walk, had seemed the very limit of what she could do. It had never crossed her mind that she might someday travel farther than that, never mind all the way across the Nine Kingdoms.<br><br> Yet there she was, hundreds of leagues from the only home she truly remembered, keeping company with a terrible black mage on holiday from his usual business of wreaking havoc, and looking forward to a nap in lodgings that had been sought for them by a prince of the royal house of Neroche. She had seen elves, mages, and horses worth a king's ransom. She had encountered kindness she hadn't deserved and refuge she hadn't dared hope for. It had been an adventure beyond her wildest imaginings and she knew it was far from over.</p><h2>Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said&#39;s Orientalism</h2><p>This is the first systematic critique of Edward Said&#39;s influential work, Orientalism, a book that for almost three decades has received wide acclaim, voluminous commentary, and translation into more than fifteen languages. Said&#39;s main thesis was that the Western image of the East was heavily biased by colonialist attitudes, racism, and more than two centuries of political exploitation. Although Said&#39;s critique was controversial, the impact of his ideas has been a pervasive rethinking of Western perceptions of Eastern cultures, plus a tendency to view all scholarship in Oriental Studies as tainted by considerations of power and prejudice. In this thorough reconsideration of Said&#39;s famous work, Ibn Warraq argues that Said&#39;s case against the West is seriously flawed. Warraq accuses Said of not only willfully misinterpreting the work of many scholars, but also of systematically misrepresenting Western civilization as a whole. With example after example, he shows that ever since the Greeks Western civilization has always had a strand in its very makeup that has accepted non-Westerners with open arms and has ever been open to foreign ideas. The author also criticizes Said for inadequate methodology, incoherent arguments, and a faulty historical understanding. He points out, not only Said&#39;s tendentious interpretations, but historical howlers that would make a sophomore blush. Warraq further looks at the destructive influence of Said&#39;s study on the history of Western painting, especially of the 19th century, and shows how, once again, the epigones of Said have succeeded in relegating thousands of first-class paintings to the lofts and storage rooms of major museums. An extended appendix reconsiders the value of 18th- and 19th-century Orientalist scholars and artists, whose work fell into disrepute as a result of Said&#39;s work.</p><p>Ibn Warraq is the highly acclaimed author of Why I Am Not a Muslim and Defending the West. He is also the editor of The Origins of the Koran, What the Koran Really Says, Leaving Islam, The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, and Which Koran?."Ibn Warraq&#x2019;s critique of Said&#x2019;s thought and work is thorough and convincing, indeed devastating to anyone depending on Saidism.

He reminds us of so many precious things in the West - and of it - that are worth upholding in the face of critics who enjoy Western liberties and denigrate them at the same time.

In Defending the West the eminent intellectual Ibn Warraq exposes with razor sharp precision the hypocrisy of Said's writings as well as the perverted academic culture that has made his great success possible.

Intellectuals and church leaders alike were divided on the veracity of these claims, and a number of pamphlets and books were published on both sides of the argument for decades. </p><p>Appearing in 1816, A Star in the West is important both as a historical study of the beliefs of the time and as a record of how Native Americans were perceived by the incipient white settlers of the United States. The book sequentially examines the traits, behaviors, customs and beliefs of the tribal societies, drawing parallels between these and the ancient practices of the Israelites. </p><p>It is thought that A Star in the West and other books in the same vein led to the establishment of the Mormon Church. The Book of Mormon attests that Native Americans had arrived in North America thousands of years ago during the Great Flood of Biblical lore. Thus, the tribes present in the 19th century were estranged descendants of the Israelite peoples. </p><p>For his part, Elias Boudinot was a U.S. Congressman who was passionately in favour of rights for Native American and black inhabitants of North America. His prominent position made his views and publications influential, and he was also noted for his devout Presbyterianism. On meeting a young, bright Cherokee native he was impressed by he allowed the man to adopt his name - the Cherokee Elias Boudinot later became a prominent figure in Native American society during the early 19th century.</p></p><p></p><h2>Three by Cain: Serenade, Love&#39;s Lovely Counterfeit, The Butterfly</h2><p>All three books are written with an enduring view of the dark corners of the American psyche. Cain hammered high art out of the crude matter of betrayal, bloodshed, and perversity.</p><p>James M. Cain hammered high art out of the crude matter of betrayal, bloodshed, and perversity. These three novels, now published together in one volume, display him at the peak of his form.James Mallahan Cain (1892-1977) was a first-rate writer of American hard-boiled crime fiction. Born in Baltimore, the son of the president of Washington College, Cain began his career as a reporter, serving in the American Expeditionary Force in World War I and writing for <i>The Cross of Lorraine</i>, the newspaper of the 79th Division. He returned from the war to embark on a literay career that included a professorship at St. John&#x2019;s College in Annapolis and a stint at <i>The New Yorker</i> as managing editor before he went to Hollywood as a script writer. Cain&#x2019;s famous first novel, <b>The Postman Always Rings Twice</b>, was published in 1934 when he was forty-two, and became an instant sensation. It was tried for obscenity in Boston and was said by Albert Camus to have inspired his own book, <b>The Stranger</b>. The infamous novel was staged in 1936, and filmed in 1946 and 1981. The story of a young hobo who has an affair with a married woman and plots with her to murder her husband and collect his insurance, <b>The Postman Always Rings Twice</b> is a benchmark of classic crime fiction and film noir. Two of Cain&#x2019;s other novels, <b>Mildred Pierce</b> (1941) and <b>Double Indemnity</b> (1943), were also made into film noir classics. In 1974, James M. Cain was awarded the Grand Master Award by the Mystery Writers of America. Cain published eighteen books in all and was working on his autobiography at the time of his death.</p><h2>The Crossing Point: Selected Talks and Writings</h2><p>A stunning example of poetic questioning.</p><p>7 x 8 1/4 trim. 19 illus.

The answer, she concluded was to be sought in arts of transformation: pottery, poetry, alchemy, spiritual self-development. Her life since then, one might say, has been just such a quest: creation in pots and in words joined with bold, original thought and with many occasions of sharing.

He had big bags beneath two bright blue eyes. His chin was covered with a meticulously trimmed, short, white beard; his hands were large, wrinkled and bore sharply defined veins which wound their way up both forearms to his rolled-up shirt- sleeves. His arms were powerful; they could have belonged to a logger or a blacksmith. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Reidar had no appetite. In the morning he never had any appetite, but being the enlightened person he was, he understood the importance of the stomach having something to work on. That was why he began every day with a bowl of porridge, which he made himself. If anyone had asked what he thought about during these minutes, he would not have been able to answer. For as he ate, he always concentrated on counting the number of spoonfuls&#x2014; 23, clink, swallow, 24, clink, swallow. A long life as a porridge- eater had taught him that a bowl would, on average, provide between thirty- eight and forty- four spoonfuls&#x2014; and if a trace of wonder lingered in his consciousness during these routine- filled moments of the new day, it was only his curiosity about how many spoonfuls it would take to scrape the bowl clean. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>While her husband was eating breakfast, Ingrid Jespersen was in bed. She always stayed in bed longer than her husband. Today she didn&#x2019;t get up until half past eight, then she wrapped a white bathrobe around her and scuttled out to the bathroom where the underfloor heating was on full. The floor was so hot it was almost impossible to stand in bare feet. She tiptoed across, then wriggled into the round shower cabinet where she took a long, hot shower. The central heating ensured that the flat was always nice and warm, but as her husband could not tolerate the same temperature in the bedroom, he always turned off the radiator thermostat before going to bed in the evening. Thus the winter cold sneaked in overnight. And even though Ingrid Jespersen was warmly covered by a thick down duvet, she liked to indulge herself with the luxury of a hot shower to awaken her limbs, get her circulation going and make her blood tingle under the the surface of her skin. Ingrid would be fifty- four this February. She often fretted at the thought of becoming old, but her appearance never bothered her. Her body was still lithe and supple. These were qualities she ascribed to her days as a dancer and her own awareness of the value of keeping yourself in good physical shape. Her waist was still slim, her legs still muscular, and even though her breasts had begun to sag and her hips no longer had their youthful, resilient roundedness, nevertheless she attracted admiring looks on the street. Her hair was still a natural dark colour with a tinge of red. But her teeth worried her. She, like everyone of her generation, had had poor dental treatment when she was a child. And in two places the fifty- year- old patchwork of fillings had been substituted with crowns. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The most pressing cause of this vanity was that she had a lover, Eyolf Str�msted, a man who had once been her ballet pupil and who was younger than her, and she did not want the age difference to become too conspicuous when she was with him. She turned off the water, opened the cabinet door and went towards the mirror where a grey patina of condensation had formed over the glass. There was still a slight touch of uneasiness when she thought about her lover&#x2019;s reaction to her smile. At first she studied her teeth by grimacing to herself in the mirror. Then she regarded the contours of her body through the film of condensation. She pressed her right hand flat against her stomach and spun half round. She looked at the curve of her back, studied her backside and examined her thigh muscles as she completed the manoeuvre. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Today, though, she stopped in mid- swing. She stood motionless in front of the mirror. She heard the outside door slam. Her husband&#x2019;s going to work without saying goodbye caused her to lose a sense of time and place for a few seconds. The bang of the door disconcerted her and she stared with vacant eyes at her own image in the glass. When at last she pulled herself together, it was to avoid looking at her own nakedness. Afterwards she ran the razor slowly down her right calf but it was an automatic, absent- minded movement, without a hint of the well- being and repose the thought of her lover had evoked minutes before. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The husband, who had long finished his porridge, and had therefore put on his coat and trudged out of the flat without a word, hesitated for a few seconds in front of the door, craned his neck and listened to the sound of running water as he conjured up images of his spouse with closed eyes, droplets forming on her eyelashes, breathing through an open mouth in the stream of scalding hot water cascading over her face. For more than ten years Reidar Folke Jespersen had practised sexual abstinence. The marital partners no longer touched each other. They had no intimate physical contact whatsoever. All the same, their love for each other still seemed to others to have a great tenderness and mutual devotion. This fa�ade was not so very different from the truth for as the couple&#x2019;s erotic love dwindled to nothing, the relationship still rested on a tacit agreement&#x2014; a psychological contract which contained all the elements of mutual respect and a willingness to accept each other&#x2019;s foibles and quirks, such as putting up with each other&#x2019;s snoring at night&#x2014; an agreement which also included the ability to do so and the extra strain involved in getting along with a person one assumed one wished well for every hour of the day. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Until three years before, Ingrid had regarded her husband&#x2019;s self- imposed celibacy as a caprice of fate, something she would have to endure in order to apportion due value to the time she had lived in tune with her physical urges. But when, about three years earlier, she allowed herself to be mounted by her ex- ballet pupil, and when the self- same slim, muscular man withdrew his penis, after next to no time, supremely aroused, out of control in his excitement and nervous ness, spraying large quantities of sperm over her breasts and stomach, Ingrid Jespersen experienced a feeling of purposeful and satisfied calm. Her daily life was given a new dimension, thanks to the lover. A hitherto ignored, but perceived lack had at long last been addressed and met. She embraced Eyolf with passion. She cradled him in her arms. She stroked his supple back and his muscular thighs. She explored him with closed eyes and sensed the satisfaction of knowing a piece of her life had slotted into place. And for the first time for a long time, as once again she felt her ex- pupil&#x2019;s penis swell between her hands, as the low winter sun cleared the neighbouring block, permitting a sharp ray to penetrate two gaps in the blinds to hit the shelf and a glass penguin&#x2014; an ornament which broke up the sunbeam into a soft carpet of colours, a rainbow effect, which covered their naked bodies and added a symbolic beauty to her physical enjoyment&#x2014; at that instant Ingrid Jespersen knew that she was experiencing something which would have a decisive impact on her later life. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Taking it as the most natural thing in the world, the two of them repeated the rendezvous the very next week. Now, three years later, they no longer needed to make any written arrangements; they just met in his flat at the same time, every Friday morning at half past eleven. They had no other contact apart from this visit, triggered and maintained by the same rather painful longing for the other&#x2019;s body and caresses. She looked forward to these weekly assignations with Eyolf in the same way that she would have looked forward to a session with a chiropodist or a psychologist. Meeting him was something she did for her well- being and her mental health. And it never occurred to her that the younger man would see it in any other way. As the weeks and months passed, as rendezvous succeeded rendezvous, they adapted to each other physically and psychologically&#x2014; from which she derived immense, unalloyed plea sure. She assumed at the same time that he would also find plea sure in this, all the days and nights when he was anywhere else but in the same bed as her. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>This morning, after taking a shower, washing her hair, shaving her legs, rubbing cream into her body, varnishing her toe- nails and applying make- up to her cheeks, lips, eyelashes and not least the rather swollen, wrinkled part under her eyes, Ingrid Jespersen once again tightened the dressing gown belt around her waist and went for a stroll through the flat. She stood studying the deep bowl on the kitchen table for a few seconds, the one with the rural pattern from Porsgrund porcelain factory. The remains of porridge, thinned with semi- skimmed milk, covered the bottom of the bowl. She automatically picked it up and rinsed it in the sink. Reidar had put the spoon in the dishwasher. He had put the carton of milk back in the door of the refrigerator. On top of the fridge, neatly folded, lay the morning edition of Aftenposten. Reidar had not touched it. The coffee machine on the worktop was full. She poured the contents into a coffee jug. It was half past nine, and she was not due to meet Eyolf for two hours. In half an hour&#x2019;s time, Reidar&#x2019;s so...</p><h2>Darkness First: A McCabe and Savage Thriller (McCabe and Savage Thrillers, 3)</h2><p><p>The mutilated body of a young woman.

In <i>Orders to Kill</i>, the KGB scholar ties dozens of victims together to expose a campaign of political murder during Putin&#x2019;s reign that even includes terrorist attacks such as the Boston Marathon Bombing. </b></p><p>Russia is no stranger to political murder, from the tsars to the Soviets to the Putin regime, during which many journalists, activists and political opponents have been killed.

She offers new information about the most famous victims, such as Alexander Litvinenko, the former FSB officer who was poisoned while living in London, and the statesman Boris Nemtsov, who was murdered outside the Kremlin in 2015, and she puts faces on many others who are less well-known in the West or forgotten. She shows that terrorist attacks in Russia, as well as the Boston Marathon bombing in the U.S., are part of the same campaign. And she explores what these murders mean for Putin&#x2019;s future, for Russia and for the West, where in America Donald Trump has claimed, &#x201c;Nobody has proven that he's killed anyone....He's always denied it....It has not been proven that he's killed reporters."</p><p><i>Orders to Kill</i> is a story long hidden in plain sight with huge ramifications.</p></p><p>Amy Knight is the author of <i>How the Cold War Began</i> and <i>Orders to Kill</i>, and has written more than thirty scholarly articles and contributed numerous pieces on Russian politics and history to the <i>New York Review of Books</i> and <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>.

The two chapters on the poisoning through radioactive polonium of former KGB officer Aleksandr Litvinenko in London break significant new ground. Knight demonstrates that the order to commit a number of the political killings she discusses can, with great likelihood, be traced back to President Putin himself or to his powerful Chechen Gauleiter Ramzan Kadyrov."<br>&#x2015;John B.

It is filled with intimate portraits of the kind of people, rich or poor, Eastern or Western, famous or humble, whose lives continue to revolve around the horse.</p> <p>Korda is a terrific storyteller, and his book is intensely personal and seductive, a joy for everyone who loves horses. Even those who have never ridden will be happy to saddle up and follow him through the world of horses, horse people, and the riding life.</p></p><p><p>Michael Korda is the author of <em>Ulysses S. Grant</em>, <em>Ike</em>, <em>Hero</em>, and <em>Charmed Lives</em>. Educated at Le Rosey in Switzerland and at Magdalen College, Oxford, he served in the Royal Air Force. He took part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and on its fiftieth anniversary was awarded the Order of Merit of the People's Republic of Hungary. He and his wife, Margaret, make their home in Dutchess County, New York.</p>Korda (Country Matters; Charmed Lives) recounts in his trademark affable style a growing involvement over decades with horses and the people who ride them. Beginning with his youth, and following with his reconnection to the horse world when he takes his son to lessons, Korda relates how horses changed his life: he met his current wife, Margaret, at New York City's Claremont Riding Academy, and eventually they purchased a home in Dutchess County with grounds to accommodate a growing number of horses. In one hilarious episode, Korda, the editor-in-chief at Simon &amp; Schuster, visits an author in Middleburg, Va., and finds himself, unprepared, on a foxhunting horse jumping over walls and into backyards. He begins to analyze the symbolism of horses ("the horse stood... for social superiority, mobility, and not getting your feet wet and muddy like ordinary folk"), but this meditation is an exception, as Korda favors the anecdote and the caricature. There are rather too many "movers and shakers" for this book to live up to the diversity implied by its title, and while he briefly raises moral questions (about foxhunting, for example), he largely ignores the sociopolitical and emotional aspects of the horse-human relationship. He takes his reader on the occasional jaunt through less tony neighborhoods (with a veterinarian in Rhinebeck, N.Y.; to a rodeo in Archer City, Tex., with Larry McMurtry; and to a correctional facility's horse farm), but he tends to focus on places like Southlands, a privately owned facility in Dutchess County. While the book is more a series of vignettes than a full narrative, Korda's humor will be a delight to anyone who loves the world of riding. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Last Day: A Novel</h2><p><b><b>A visionary and powerful debut thriller set in a terrifyingly plausible dystopian near-future&#x2014;with clear parallels to today's headlines&#x2014;in which the future of humanity lies in the hands of one woman, a scientist who has stumbled upon a secret that the government will go to any lengths to keep hidden</b></b><br><br><i>A world half in darkness.

The area plays host to a wide range of species, from thousand-year-old western cedars to humpback whales to iconic white Spirit bears.<p>According to local residents, another giant is said to live in these woods. For centuries people have reported encounters with the Sasquatch&#x2015;a species of hairy bipedal man-apes said to inhabit the deepest recesses of this pristine wilderness. Driven by his own childhood obsession with the creatures, John Zada decides to seek out the diverse inhabitants of this rugged and far-flung coast, where nearly everyone has a story to tell, from a scientist who dedicated his life to researching the Sasquatch, to members of the area&#x2019;s First Nations, to a former grizzly bear hunter-turned-nature tour guide. With each tale, Zada discovers that his search for the Sasquatch is a quest for something infinitely more complex, cutting across questions of human perception, scientific inquiry, indigenous traditions, the environment, and the power and desire of the human imagination to believe in&#x2015;or reject&#x2015;something largely unseen. </p><p>Teeming with gorgeous nature writing and a driving narrative that takes us through the forests and into the valleys of a remote and seldom visited region, <i>In the Valleys of the Noble Beyond</i> sheds light on what our decades-long pursuit of the Sasquatch can tell us about ourselves and invites us to welcome wonder for the unknown back into our lives.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2019:</strong> To many (or most), Bigfoot is a fantastical if not downright silly subject, one that has attracted mostly silly contributions. If you're a thoughtful person with a fact-based career&#x2014;say, a scientist or journalist&#x2014;pursuing the notorious Skunk Ape can hinder your professional ambitions, or scuttle them entirely. John Zada might be one of the exceptions. Like many children of the 1970s who grew up watching Leonard Nimoy <em>In Search Of</em> unexplained phenomena, <em>The Six-Million Dollar Man's</em> battles with an extraterrestrial Urayuli, and (for the real deep-divers) the low-rent cin�ma v�rit� of <em>The Legend of Boggy Creek</em>, he developed a thing for Sasquatch. But while he grew up to become a globe-traveling writer and photographer whose work has appeared in <em>The Globe &amp; Mail</em> and the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em>, that thing never really went away. <p>While exploring the Great Bear Rainforest, a remote and utterly wild expanse on British Columbia's northwest coast, Zada was struck by the prevalence of Sasquatch wherever he went&#x2014;and not just the quantity of the narratives, but the matter-of-fact manner of the storytellers. He returned with a mission, interviewing scientists, First Nations peoples, hunters, and conservationists about the legendary giant, and did he ever bring back some good Bigfoot stories! <em>In the Valleys of the Noble Beyond</em> (originally envisioned as an article before the pile-up of material turned it into a book) takes those accounts seriously while walking a fine line between skepticism and credulity. It's less the hooting and wood-knocking sensationalism of <em>Finding Bigfoot</em> (though that show certainly has its charms) than Robert Michael Pyles's <em>Where Bigfoot Walks</em>, another book that leans toward respectability with its emphasis on natural history. Zada's entry is a beautifully rendered account of a mist-shrouded world suspended between myth and modernity: its people, culture, and ecology, and, for receptive readers, its most mysterious denizen. <em>&#x2014;Jon Foro</em></p><b>John Zada</b> is a writer, photographer, and journalist drawn to stories about adventure and far-flung parts of the world.

When Milt Pappas was not listed on the Hall of Fame ballot, his protests were met with howls of derision. He won only 209 games and had a winning percentage of only 560, they said. Not good enough for the Hall.<p>Now, here's the new Hall of Famer, Mr. Drysdale, who won the same 209 games pitching for the best team of the era....If there's a sub-basement at Cooperstown, I suggest the plaque be hung there.</p><p>-- Randall Kendrick</p><p><i>Baseball Digest,</i> May 1984</p></blockquote><p>There are many distinctions which can be drawn between Drysdale and Pappas, and many similarities. Presenting first the full record.</p><p>Drysdale was more of a power pitcher than Pappas, recording 758 more strikeouts. He had better earned run averages and better ERA components (control, opposition batting average). Drysdale pitched for more championship teams and more teams that were in the pennant race. He was a better hitter, and he established a well-known record in 1968, since broken by Orel Hershiser.</p><p>Almost all of those issues have another side to them (if he pitched for better teams, shouldn't he be expected to have posted a <i>better</i> won-lost record?), and I'll discuss all of them later, in Chapter 31. I wanted to deal here with what I think is really the key difference between them, which is the issue of consistency versus peak performance.</p><p>One of the most dependable patterns in Hall of Fame voting, both in the BBWAA vote and from the Veterans Committee, is that players who have big seasons are much more likely to be selected than are players of equal overall accomplishment, but greater consistency. Drysdale, who had 27 points in the Black Ink Test, had many more big seasons than Pappas, who had 5.</p><p>I could give countless examples to demonstrate this. It is an overstatement, but not much of one, to say that every marginal Hall of Famer in history had some big seasons with eye-catching numbers, while every marginal player who <i>isn't</i> in the Hall of Fame didn't have those big seasons. I'll give you four examples:</p><p><b>1. Jack Chesbro and Jesse Tannehill.</b> Chesbro won 199 games in his career, lost 131. In his best season, 1903, he threw a wild pitch on the last day of the season that cost his team the pennant, and that made him one of the most famous big-game goats of the first 25 years of this century. He was selected to the Hall of Fame in 1946.</p><p>Jesse Tannehill, who was born in the same year as Chesbro (1874), was Chesbro's teammate for much of his career, first in Pittsburgh (1899-1902) and later with the New York Yankees, then called the Highlanders (1903). His career record (197-116) is very similar to Chesbro's (199-131), but distinctly better -- yet he is not in the Hall of Fame.</p><p>In fact, the four pitchers who were the Pirates' rotation when they won the National League in 1901 (Chesbro, Tannehill, Sam Leever and Deacon Phillippe) all had extremely similar career records.</p><p>Chesbro had probably the poorest career record of the four, Sam Leever the best, yet Chesbro is the only one who is in the Hall of Fame. Why?</p><p>You all know the answer. He had the big year.</p><p><b>2. Dazzy Vance and Lon Warneke.</b> Dazzy Vance, a National League pitcher of the 1920s and 1930s, won 197 games in his career, lost 140. He's in the Hall of Fame.</p><p>Lon Warneke, a National League pitcher who came along a few years later and also threw very hard, won 193 games and lost only 121.</p><p>Warneke's record is a little better, but in 1955, when both pitchers were eligible, Vance drew 205 votes and was elected. Warneke didn't draw a vote. Why?</p><p>Vance had some monster years. He went 28-6 in 1924, led the league in ERA at 2.16 and struck out more men than any other two pitchers in the major leagues. He also went 22-9 in 1925, 22-10 in 1928 and in 1930, at the age of 39, led the National League in ERA.</p><p>Warneke had some good years, too -- 22-6, 22-10, 20-13 -- but just not quite at the same level. Big years get you in the Hall of Fame.</p><p><b>3. Roger Maris and Bob Allison.</b> Bob Allison's career totals are very similar to Roger Maris's.</p><p>Neither Maris nor Allison is in the Hall of Fame yet, but Maris drew strong support, peaking at 176 to 184 votes each year from 1986 to 1988.</p><p>Bob Allison was the most feared baserunner of his time. He played center field when he first came up, played it well -- yet his vote total peaked at zero. Why?</p><p>You know the answer. Maris had the big year.</p><p><b>4. Ron Guidry and Sandy Koufax.</b> You may be surprised to learn that Ron Guidry's career record is comparable to Sandy Koufax's.</p><p>Koufax's ERA is a little better, but half of that difference is created by league ERAs.</p><p>Koufax, of course, flew into the Hall of Fame because he was the dominant pitcher of his time, 1963-1966. Guidry had only one year of comparable dominance, and certainly cannot expect to sweep into the Hall of Fame as Koufax did.</p><p>Another example, which I won't use in the same way because I'm not sure what the Hall of Fame voters are going to do, is Don Sutton and Steve Carlton. Don Sutton, believe it or not, has a career record that is substantially similar to Steve Carlton's.</p><p>Steve Carlton had big seasons, and because of this he found the Hall of Fame door as open as Madonna's...uh, arms. He was elected on the first ballot when he became eligible in 1993. Sutton, who plodded along at an annual pace of 17 or 18 wins, will still provoke an argument despite his overwhelming credentials. Carlton scored 69 points on the Black Ink Test; Sutton scored at 8.</p><p>Bob Carroll, whose writing I enjoy very much, commented on this phenomenon in his 1985 article for the <i>National Pastime</i> ("For the Hall of Fame: Twelve Good Men"). "Consistency may be the hobgoblin of little minds," wrote Carroll, "but it can also make certain ballplayers nigh unto invisible. Indian Bob Johnson never had one of those super seasons that make everyone sit up and whistle. While phenoms came, collected their MVP trophies, and faded, he just kept plodding along hitting .300, with a couple dozen homers and a hundred ribbies year after year...like a guy punching a time clock."</p><p>His specific point has merit. Johnson's career numbers, in the context of their time, are probably better than Hack Wilson's, but Wilson had the big year. Carroll, at least, is rational on the subject; some guys get really carried away with it.</p><p>Anyway, to state first the argument that this is an injustice...think of the player's career record as if it was a season's record. Suppose that Ken Griffey, Jr., winds up this season with 37 homers, 118 RBI and a .326 average, but Juan Gonzalez posts even better numbers. Some people will argue that Griffey should win the MVP Award because he's a better defensive outfielder, some people will argue that Griffey should win because the Mariners had a better year, somebody might argue that he should win because he's a better baserunner and hit better in the clutch. But would <i>anybody</i> argue that he should be given extra credit because he hit .437 in July? It's obvious, isn't it, that if he has better numbers in July but poorer numbers overall, he must have done worse some other time?</p><p>The seasons of a career, we might argue, are like the pieces of a season -- individually interesting, but not fundamentally relevant to value.</p><p>Now let's look at it from the other side. You know the old saying about a statistician...if you have one foot in a block of ice and the other in a fire, a statistician will tell you that on average you're comfortable. This problem is like that: It is dangerous to ignore fluctuations in performance, and assume that the aggregate total reflects the impact of the elements.</p><p>But in this case it is held <i>against</i> the player if he stays at a comfortable temperature. The players who put one foot in a block of ice and the other in the fire get extra credit for it. Is that fair?</p><p>Because pitchers are less consistent than hitters, this is a more common problem in evaluating pitchers than it is in evaluating hitters.</p><p>The analogy that seasons are to careers as months are to seasons, it seems to me, has one major flaw, which is that it doesn't account for pennant races. A pennant is a real thing, an object in itself; if you win it, it's forever. If a pitcher goes 7-0 in June and puts his team into first place, that's just June; if he then goes 1-5 in July and the team slips to fourth place, the end result is pretty much the same as if the hot streak had never existed.</p><p>This is not true of seasons. If a pitcher goes 24-5 in one year and leads his team to a World Championship, that flag is going to fly forever. If he goes 5-17 the next year, they don't take the flag down.</p><p>On the other hand, we cannot <i>assume</i> that the pitcher who has a big year and then a bad year has had a positive impact on his team's chances in the pennant race. Bill Singer went 20-12 with the Dodgers in 1969 and 20-14 with California in 1973, but in between went 10-17 and 6-16. He never played with a championship team. If he had just been a nice, consistent 14-14 every year, his teams would have won at least one pennant and possibly two. The 1969 and 1973 teams were so weak that they weren't going to win no matter what Singer did, but the 1971 Dodgers, for whom he went 10-17 with a 4.17 ERA, missed the National League West championship by one game. There's no question but that a decent year by Singer would have put them over the top. The 1972 team, for whom he went 6-16, missed...</p></p><h2>Death of a Colonial (Sir John Fielding)</h2><p>&#x201c;A rich rewarding trip for everyone.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <b>&#x201c;</b>Alexander&#x2019;s eye for period detail is sharp and subtle; he brings his historic England back to life in layers.<b>&#x201d; </b>&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune<br><br></i>When a nobleman is executed, his possessions are expected to go to the Crown, as he is the last of his line.

Sheila Caruso--ex-con, mother to Sadie and Caleb, and resident of Hanover House--is working for the writer when she discovers that a scene in one of his novels matches the crime scene. When Police Chief Cade and Blair Owens discover a second dead teenager--mirroring a murder in another of the eccentric writer&#39;s books--Cade is drawn into a web of trickery and deceit. Evidence turns up in Cade&#39;s own truck, and suddenly he becomes the number-one suspect. Cade tries to clear his name, but when eighteen-year-old Sadie Caruso disappears, tensions mount to a fever pitch. Can Cade find the real killer before Sadie winds up dead? Is the novelist a demented killer, or a hapless victim? And what does Sadie&#39;s own mother have to do with the crimes? Secrets are uncovered, while lessons are learned about the sins of the father being visited upon his children. Will the consequences of Sheila&#39;s life be fatal, or is there redemption and mercy for her and her children? &#39;Chief Matthew Cade rarely considered another line of work, but news of the dead teenage girl made him long for a job as an accountant or electrician---some benign vocation that didn&#39;t require him to look into the eyes of grieving parents.&#39;<p>Terri Blackstock has sold over seven million books worldwide and is a <em>New York Times</em> and <em>USA TODAY</em> bestselling author.

And thanks to her habit of insanely hoarding everything from bales of cloth to old wrapping paper, she has pictures of every incarnation, which are lushly reproduced in her immensely fun scrapbook-memoir, Absolutely. EVENING STANDARD Her beauty does not fade and her unquenchable spirit for adventure seems more apparent than ever. Joanna Lumley is, for many, something of a national treasure. In this new illustrated memoir, we trot through her childhood in Kashmir...to her days of modelling in the Swinging Sixties and her move into acting. Luckily for fans, Lumley is a committed hoarder so there is a wealth of fantastic photographs and press cuttings to feast upon. DAILY EXPRESS Mischievous and measured, Joanna Lumley gives us a remarkable portrait of a groovy life...Lots of facts, little hyperbole and a pervasive sense of self effacement, a very British talent for understatement and self-deprecation and (and this, in an age of vomit-into-the-void celebrity culture is perhaps what stands out and pleases the most) restraint...that makes this such a refreshing read...she gives us the facts - and photographs - from a life astonishingly rich in experience. -- Sarah Vine THE TIMES A full-page photograph at the begining of Joanna Lumley's glossy memoir shows the nation's darling in full evening dress, wearing a glittering tiara...crimson sash and gold star...The portrait captures perfectly the mixture of poshness and larkiness that has captivated Joanna Lumley's audiences...Tempting as it is to concentrate on the wealth of photographs, it would be a pity to ignore the linking text.

They are celebrating Jonathan's birthday and are told that Jonathan's uncle Simeon has just arrived for a visit and is telling tales of assassins hired to kill Emperor Titus. Simeon is on his way to Rome and Jonathan begs to go along with him, believing that his mother may be one of the Jewish women that Titus is holding captive in his palace in Rome. The pair leave Ostia for Rome, secretly followed by their friends. Jonathan eventually finds his mother, and Flavia, Nubia, and Lupus solve the mystery surrounding the assassins and discover that many rumors about Titus are false. Each chapter alternates between the two adventures, which converge at the end of the book. Justine Eyre provides a skilled reading, giving the friends distinct voices and deftly handling the diverse accents of the minor characters. In most instances, the pacing is excellent, but the pause between the two story lines is too brief to fully alert listeners to the change. Chock full of rich details about Roman life in the first century, this is an exciting and fun listening experience.&#x2013;<i>Wendy Woodfill, Hennepin County Library, Minnetonka, MN</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was educated as a scholar of classical languages at Eton College and Cambridge University in England and later at Hebrew University, Israel. As a student, he was a philosopher and self-proclaimed agnostic.<br> While in the British Medical Corps during World War II, Prince began to study the Bible as a philosophical work. Converted through a powerful encounter with Jesus Christ, he was baptized in the Holy Spirit a few days later. This life-changing experience altered the whole course of his life, which he thereafter devoted to studying and teaching the Bible as the Word of God.<br> Internationally recognized as a Bible scholar and spiritual patriarch, Derek Prince taught and ministered on six continents for more than sixty years.

Among them is Rachel Vinrace, a young girl, innocent and wholly ignorant of the world of politics and society, books, sex, love and marriage. She is a free spirit half-caught, momentarily and passionately, by Terence Hewet, an aspiring writer who she meets in Santa Marina. But their engagement is to end abruptly, and tragically. Virginia Woolf's first novel, published in 1915, is a haunting exploration of a young woman's mind, signalling the beginning of her fascination with capturing the mysteries and complexities of the inner life.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>The Modern Library is proud to include Virginia Woolf's first novel, The Voyage Out--together with a new Introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Cunningham. Published to acclaim in England in 1915 and in America five years later, The Voyage Out marks Woolf's beginning as one of the twentieth century's most brilliant and prolific writers. <br>Less formally experimental than her later novels, The Voyage Out none-theless clearly lays bare the poetic style and innovative technique--with its multiple figures of consciousness, its detailed portraits of characters' inner lives, and its constant shifting between the quotidian and the profound--that are the signature of Woolf's fiction. <br>Rachel Vinrace, Woolf's first heroine, is a motherless young woman who, at twenty-four, embarks on a sea voyage with a party of other English folk to South America. Guileless, and with only a smattering of education, Rachel is taken under the wing of her aunt Helen, who desires to teach Rachel "how to live."Arriving in Santa Marina, a village on the South American coast, Rachel and Helen are introduced to a group of English expatriates. Among them is the young, sensitive Terence Hewet, an aspiring writer, with whom Rachel falls in love. But theirs is ultimately a tale of doomed love, set against a chorus of other stories and other points of view, as the narrative shifts focus between its central and peripheral characters. E. M. Forster praised The Voyage Out as "a book which attains unity as surely as "Wuthering Heights, though by a different path." <br>This edition includes a new Introduction by Michael Cunningham, bestselling author of "The Hours. Cunningham at once unfolds an engaging shortessay of Woolf's early life and career, an insightful exploration of the themes to which Woolf returns again and again in her fiction, and a spirited defense of the relevance and lasting importance of her art. Katherine Anne Porter wrote of Woolf: "The world of arts was her native territory; she ranged freely under her own sky, speaking her mother tongue fearlessly."The Voyage Out (1915) is the story of a rite of passage. When Rachel Vinrace embarks for South America on her father&#39;s ship she is launched on a course of self-discovery in a modern version of the mythic voyage. Virginia Woolf knew all too well the forms that she was supposed to follow when writing of a young lady&#39;s entrance into the world, and she struggled to subvert the conventions, wittily and assiduously, rewriting and revising the novel many times. The finished work is not, on the face of it, a &#39;portrait of the artist&#39;. However, through The Voyage Out readers discover Woolf as an emerging and original artist: not identified with the heroine, but present everywhere in the social satire, the lyricism, and the patterning of consciousness.</p><h2>Disinherited Mind: Essays in Modern German Literature and Thought</h2><p>Heller examines the sense of values embodied in the works of key German writers and thinkers from Goethe to Kafka, particularly the consciousness of life's depreciation.<br></p><p>Erich Heller (March 27, 1911 &#x2014; November 5, 1990) was a British essayist, known particularly for his critical studies in German-language philosophy and literature of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<br><br><p></p> <p></p> <p>Heller was born at Chomutov (German: <i>Komotau</i>) in Bohemia (then within Austria-Hungary, now the Czech Republic), to the family of a Jewish physician.

In addition to providing a complete (and exciting) picture of Crane's life, Berryman gives a focused assessment of Crane's poetry, prose, and journalism, discussing how critics have regarded these writings over the course of a century.</p><p>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, John Berryman (1914-1972) was the author of <i>77 Dream Songs</i>, <i>Love &amp; Fame</i>, and <i>Berryman's Shakespeare</i>.Crane was popular while alive, but slipped quickly into obscurity after his death. He died at age 28 but did leave a legacy of published novels, short stories, poetry, and journalism. Released initially in 1950 and then revised in 1962, this was the first serious critical look at Crane, buttressing his reputation as a great American artist, although his creativity, or at least his application of it, came sporadically. Berryman offers lots of insight into Crane's creative process. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Thousand Nights and One Night (Calla Editions)</h2><p>This stunningly illustrated selection of tales from the classic Arabian Nights features silhouette and color art by noted children&#39;s book illustrator Jan Pienkowski.

To be an animal is to be in possession of a physical body, a body which can eat, drink and sleep; it is also to be embedded in a worldwide network of ecosystems. When every human body has an uncanny global presence, how do we live with ourselves? In this timely and elegant essay, Daisy Hildyard captures the second body by exploring how the human is a part of animal life. She meets Richard, a butcher in Yorkshire, and sees pigs turned into boiled ham; and Gina, an environmental criminologist, who tells her about leopards and silver foxes kept as pets in luxury apartments. She speaks to Luis, a biologist, about the origins of life; and talks to Nadezhda about fungi in an effort to understand how we define animal life. Eventually, her second body comes to visit her first body when the river flooded her home last year. <i>The Second Body</i> is a brilliantly lucid account of the dissolving boundaries between all life on earth.</p><p>Daisy Hildyard holds a PhD in the history of science, and has previously published essays on the language of science, and on seventeenth-century mathematics. Her first novel <i>Hunters in the Snow</i> received the Somerset Maugham Award and a &#x2018;5 under 35&#x2019; honorarium at the USA National Book Awards. She lives with her family in North Yorkshire, where she was born.You are stuck in your body right here, but in a technical way, you are also in India and Iraq, you are in the sky causing storms, and you are in the sea herding whales towards the beach. You probably don&#x2019;t feel your body in those places: it is as if you have two distinct bodies. You have an individual body in which you exist, eat, sleep and go about your day-to-day life. You also have a second body which is involved with foreign countries and whales. Climate change makes every animal body implicated in the whole world, but some animals are more worldly than others. Indeed, writers have argued that theories about global trade and man-made climate change are signs of human self-obsession. Embarrassing, actually, it&#x2019;s like we all think that somebody is waving at us when in reality they are waving at somebody behind us. We need everything on earth to be a product of our bodies in the way a child needs to put a marble in her mouth. <br> It feels to me that this global truth is alienated from its real life in an animal body. When a small brown pigeon got stuck in my kitchen - it was slipperier than I&#x2019;d have expected, it went out of my hands like a fish...that was a real thing. When I saw satellite impressions of ice shelves breaking off and floating away...that was the truth. In my job, I speak to people who work with animals, and they, too, often give me an impression that there are different ways to exist in a body; that there is a truthful body and a real one. <br> The true things: satellite images; shots of chromosomes; hydrocarbon spreadsheets, don&#x2019;t always feel real. Meanwhile, the real living bodies don&#x2019;t feel like they have much to do with the complicated truth about life on earth. I cannot make myself much interested in this truth &#x2013; it feels far off. I don&#x2019;t want to hear about climate change or the biosphere, I want to hear about real people and real creatures. But there is a sense that the horizon is moving nearer &#x2013; that I should be paying attention, because one day the ice shelf will come ripping through the tissue of my body &#x2013; through everybody &#x2013; even if it appears, for now, that the bodies all around me are intact. When I approached my pigeon it made a squeaking sound in fear and I realised it couldn&#x2019;t fly. It still had threads of pale fluff sticking out of its neckfeathers so it must have been young. It did occur to me that I could have wrung its neck and eaten it, but I didn&#x2019;t, I cared for it for a while, it was quite greedy and it fell off the edge of a bucket once while trying to get at seed. Its legs leaned at an angle back from its claws: L. The talons curved up out of the ends of each toe and didn&#x2019;t seem to actually touch the ground when it walked. It was definitely using its eyes - a very round pale brown eye which blinked. I could see its mind in its body. It turned its head every few seconds to get a proper view of me. <br> I kept it in the shed and fed it seed. It still wouldn&#x2019;t fly. I was worried it would be attacked by a rat in there and one day I lost patience, I thought: it has to live for itself. I turned it out into the yard and closed the shed door. The pigeon spent hours scuffling around on the concrete, and I nearly caught it and let it back in the shed, but then suddenly it was up on the roof. I didn&#x2019;t see it get there, and it rested for a while. Perhaps it will fall, I thought, but I was watching when two other pigeons, both grey, both larger than my pigeon, came for it. They were all on the grey roof together and then they all, at the same time, opened their wings and floated into the air, incredibly slowly. They were close together, and their wings made a kind of dome shape from where I was standing. It didn&#x2019;t look like they were flying so much as it looked like they were being pulled into space. I could see the three of them lifted further, and eventually they were so far away that I couldn&#x2019;t see them. It was December and the sky was almost white. Afterwards I went to the sink and cleaned and dried my hands. It was strange that the pigeon had previously been constrained by them.</p><h2>Joni: The Creative Odyssey of Joni Mitchell</h2><p>From the moment Joni Mitchell's career began &#x2014; with coffee-house bookings, serendipitous encounters with established stars, and a recording contract that gave her full creative control over her music &#x2014; the woman from the Canadian wheat fields has eluded industry cliches. When her peers were focused on feminism, Mitchell was plumbing the depths of her own human condition. When arena rock was king, she turned to jazz. When all others hailed Bob Dylan as a musical messiah, Mitchell saw a fraud burdened with halitosis. Unafraid to "write in her own blood," regardless of the cost, Mitchell has been vilified as a diva and embraced as a genius, but rarely has she been recognized as an artist and a thinker.<br><br>This new portrait of the reclusive icon examines how significant life events &#x2014; failed relationships, the surrender of her infant daughter, debilitating sickness &#x2014; have influenced her creative expression. Author <b>Katherine Monk</b> captures the rich legacy of her multifaceted subject in this offbeat account, weaving in personal reflections and astute cultural observations, and revealing the Mitchell who remains misunderstood.<br></p><p><b>Katherine Monk</b> is a national movie journalist for Postmedia News Service.

Joni Mitchell has been part of her life's soundtrack for as long as she can remember. She lives in Vancouver.<br>"I devoured this book thrilling, dimensional, thorough; a gift to any Joni Mitchell fan; an in-depth portrait of the life of an artist.

Ichigo is an impulsive member of a girls-only biker gang who firmly believes in honor, loyalty, and fist fighting. Together this unlikeliest of duos strikes out on a journey to find a legendary embroiderer who might just be able to make their dreams come true. Inspired by the cult-classic novel by the same name, this exclusive manga edition of Novala Takemoto&#39;s Kamikaze Girls contains several brand new stories, including a continuation of Momoko and Ichigo&#39;s misadventures that was approved by the author himself!</p><p>Born January 26, in Uji City, Kyoto.

Other novels include "uloko hime," "twins," "A Child Abandoned by Deus," and "calps alpis." His sequel to "Kamikaze Girls" was published in June of 2005.<br><b>Official website: http://www.novala.net/<br></b>This charming example of <i>shojo</i> (manga for adolescent girls) adapts a popular novel/movie and adds two original stories dealing with the same characters and/or set in the same commercial milieu. Momoko is ultra-sensitive and feminine, picturing herself as a pampered French princess while meticulously embroidering frilly clothes. Ichigo is a member of a girls' biker gang who hides softer emotions and dresses like a feisty boy. When the two young people are thrown together, each helps the other develop new skills for survival&#x2014;and for living as a whole woman. Artist Kanesada continues Takemoto's story by writing and drawing an additional episode in Ichigo's maturation, then concludes with a tale about a schoolgirl who falls in love with an older man in the garment industry. The book is more character-driven than much manga, and the page layouts do an unusually good job of weaving together different levels of the action, as readers can simultaneously see what the characters are doing, saying and thinking. There's something creepy about young girls calling themselves "Lolitas" and imagining that having sex with a grownup will transform them into grownups, too. Still, there's also a genuine sweetness about these stories as the characters grope uncertainly with new roles and take chances that can pay off wonderfully. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He'd simply been curious why Zoelner had run like a scalded dog out of the raucous barbeque that had been in full swing back at the shop. And he figured a couple of cold ones might loosen the guy's tongue.</p> <p>But it wasn't a bottle of Budweiser Zoelner ordered after plunking himself down on a stool at the long mahogany bar, hooking the heels of his biker boots over the brass foot rail. It was scotch. An entire bottle.</p> <p>And Mac hadn't been able to sit by nursing a beer while Zoelner proceeded to get piss drunk. For one thing, sitting by and watching a friend and trusted teammate get piss drunk, well, it was just...sad. And for another thing, he knew when men like them set about getting piss drunk, it was usually because something had triggered past demons to come out and play. Past demons in the form of dark memories of good men now dead, of missions or assignments or cases gone horribly wrong, or of bad calls that drove a guy crazy asking himself the sonofabitching question of what if.</p> <p>What if I'd done things differently?</p> <p>What if I'd moved just a little faster?</p> <p>What if I'd taken a second look at that last bit of Intel?</p> <p>It was a useless endeavor...asking what if. But that didn't mean all the operators at the privately run covert government defense firm known as Black Knights Inc. didn't indulge in it occasionally. Hell, more than occasionally. Asking what if seemed to come part and parcel with the job. And tonight it appeared Zoelner was doing just that...asking what if with gusto and single-minded determination all washed down with a healthy portion of twenty-year-old scotch-hiccup. And Mac, sympathetic fool that he was, had voluntarily joined in for the ride.</p> <p>The good Lord knew he'd pay for it tomorrow with a headache big enough to drop a mule, followed by eight to ten hours of straight mainlining coffee in an attempt to combat the effects. But for right now, he felt pretty good. Except for the gritty eyes, his body was numb and tingly. His tongue particularly so. Which was why when he finally turned to Zoelner, breaking the we're-men-so-we-drink-in-silence thing they had going, and asked, "So, you gonna tell me why we're sitting here gettin' drunker than a betsy bug on a Tuesday night?" the second to the last word came out sounding more like Tushday.</p> <p>Zoelner, usually known for his smooth movements and strange bouts of statue-like stillness, turned unsteadily toward him. His slate gray irises were nearly obscured by the heavy lids hanging over them. The left lid appeared to have suffered the influence of the scotch more than the right because it drooped just a fraction lower.</p> <p>"First of all," Zoelner said, "has anyone ever told you the big-hat-and-no-cattle Texan comes out in you when you're tipsy?" He grinned lopsidedly. "And secondly," his expression turned serious, "don't go getting mushy on me."</p> <p>"I'll have you know I grew up with a hat and cattle." Mac frowned. "And I'm not gettin' mushy on you. I just thought, you know, you might want to talk about," he made a rolling motion with his hand, "whatever."</p> <p>Zoelner glanced around the bar, squinting at the red vinyl booths, the burly clientele, and the roaring jukebox like he'd never seen the place before. "Where am I?" He blinked owlishly. "I could've sworn I sat down in a badass biker bar, but at some point I must've been transported into the middle of a chick flick."</p> <p>When he turned back, Mac made sure his expression was bland.</p> <p>"Okay." Zoelner rolled his eyes. "So, let's talk. Let's delve into the depths of my emotions, of how I'm feeling. Then, after we're done doing that," he batted his lashes like he was trying out for a Revlon commercial or something, "we can ask the bartender to exchange our scotch for herbal tea and go find some Indigo Girls on the jukebox."</p> <p>Mac snorted. His nose filled with the smells of stale beer, crushed peanut shells, and cowhide from the overabundance of leather being sported around the place. Except for the peanut shells, the scents reminded him of home, of The Lazy M ranch where he'd been born and raised.</p> <p>All hat and no cattle, my ass.</p> <p>"All right, shitheel," he grumbled. "So maybe you're not too keen on hashing out what's jerked a knot in your tail tonight." Zoelner's wide grin returned, and Mac realized with that last turn of phrase he'd proved the guy's point about the Texan coming out in him after he'd had a few. But he couldn't help it. Nor, come to think of it, would he want to. Because like most Texans, he was good-and-goddamned proud to say he hailed from the Lone Star State. Yeehaw! And pray the creek don't rise! "But I just gotta know...this doesn't have anything to do with Agent Winterfield, does it?"</p> <p>Luke Winterfield was a rogue CIA agent who leaked information about the number and location of the U.S. government's black sites to the press. Some called Winterfield a whistleblower. Mac called him a traitor. And just this morning, splashed across the headlines, was news that the bastard had found a country to grant him asylum. It had to be a major blow for every CIA agent out there-even an ex&#x2013;CIA agent like Zoelner.</p> <p>"Pssshht." Zoelner made a face. "I stopped caring about The Company and its shenanigans years ago. As for Winterfield, I never met the ashhole." Zoelner frowned and rolled in his lips before trying again. "Asshole."</p> <p>"Then what on God's green earth is tonight all about?" Mac demanded. "Because I gotta be honest. This whole sittin'-here-in-silence-while-we-drink-ourselves-good-lookin' thing has just about run its course with me."</p> <p>Zoelner tipped his glass of scotch toward the opposite end of the bar. "I don't want to talk about it," he said. "Actually, I don't want to talk about anything other than that brunette over there, and the fact that she's been eyeing the two of us like we're tall drinks of water and she's been lost in the desert for days."</p> <p>Mac glanced down the polished length of mahogany and...sure enough. There was a bird in a tight top and buttery-soft biker jacket sitting near the end. She looked like she might've stepped off the cover of a motorcycle magazine-having that whole sexy-without-being-overly-pretty thing going. And when she caught him staring, she licked her ruby-red lips and seductively lowered her thick, sooty lashes.</p> <p>Can you say invitation, ladies and gents? Even in his scotch-addled state, Mac recognized the blatant come-and-get-me-big-boy look in her eyes.</p> <p>Sorry, darlin'. But you're barkin' up the wrong tree.</p> <p>"No, thanks," he told Zoelner, sitting back and lifting his glass of scotch to his lips. "She's not my type."</p> <p>Zoelner hooted with laughter, slamming down his empty tumbler. "Type? Dear God, it's not like you're looking for a blood donor or anything. Type hasn't got a damned thing to do with it. She's hot. She's obviously horny. And one of us should do something about that."</p> <p>"Be my guest."</p> <p>Zoelner cocked his head. "You remind me of a giant black hole, sucking all the light and fun out of the evening."</p> <p>"Me?" Mac turned on the man incredulously. "I'm not the one who decided to spend the night sitting at this...this sausage-factory of a bar, quietly getting stone-cold shit-faced."</p> <p>"Hmm." Zoelner narrowed his eyes. "Sausage-factory of a bar, eh? Meaning there are too many swinging dicks and not enough soft and sexies around tonight? Do I detect a hint of melancholy?"</p> <p>"That's a big word for a drunk man." Mac chuckled.</p> <p>"I'm not that drunk," Zoelner insisted, and Mac grabbed his stomach, laughing out loud. "Okay, so maybe I am that drunk," Zoelner admitted, "but that doesn't mean I'm wrong. My point is, I think you're not interested in the brown-haired Betty over there because you're pining away... Is that how you Texans would put it? Pining? For a certain redhead who's suspiciously absent from the bar tonight."</p> <p>And that strangled Mac's laughter into a cough. He lifted his glass to suck down a drop of scotch. Carefully placing the tumbler back on the bar, he ran his tongue over his teeth and said, "I don't know what you're talkin' about."</p> <p>"The hell you don't." Zoelner snorted. "Anyone with eyes in their head knows you're hot-to-trot for our usual bartendress. And if all her come-ons are anything to go by, she's hot-to-trot for you, too. Which begs the question...what are you waiting on? Why haven't you hit that, like, a thousand times by now?"</p> <p>"Hit that?" Mac pulled a face. "What are we? Fifteen?"</p> <p>"Dodging the question?" Zoelner countered, and Mac didn't know whether to applaud the man's astuteness or strangle him right where he sat.</p> <p>Deciding neither scenario would be all that satisfying, he shrugged his shoulders in what he hoped was a gesture of supreme unconcern. "That Woman,"-Mac always thought of Delilah Fairchild, proprietress and namesake of the bar they were currently sitting in, that way, in capital letters-"isn't my type either. And you know why."</p> <p>"Bullshit."</p> <p>Just the one word. Spoken with complete conviction.</p> <p>Mac gifted Zoelner with a dirty look and reached for the bottle of Lagavulin. Upending it, he poured the last few drops into his glass, then slowly lifted the tumbler, taking a leisurely sip.</p> <p>"You know what I think of that whole thing, right?" Zoelner asked. Mac ignored him, wishing like hell he'd never opened his big mouth after that goddamned mission in Somalia. But sitting in a bar in South Africa, basking in the glow of a successful operation-and after having downed a half dozen beers-the whole sorry story had come tumbling out. "Oh, and what? Now you're a mute?" Zoelner inquired after it became apparent Mac wasn't going to rise to his bait.</p> <p>But what could Mac say? The truth was, he did know what Zoelner thought. The guy had flat-out told him he was an idiot to compare one woman to another. Horseshit was the word Zoelner used if Mac remembered right. But the guy just didn't understand. He didn't know what-</p> <p>"Fine," Zoelner spat, shaking his head. "So, we'll pretend Delilah Fairchild isn't your type either."</p> <p>And, yeah. It would be pretending. Because, in all honesty, they both knew That Woman was every man's type. Not only was she a perfect ten on the curve-o-meter, but her heart-shaped face, with her clear green eyes and pouty Kewpie-bow lips, belonged on primetime television. And, as if all that wasn't enough, her pale, creamy skin had to go and be all flawless and shit. Seriously, no matter how closely Mac looked, he couldn't find a single pore to mar her porcelain complexion. To put it quite simply, from the top of her head to the ends of her red-tipped toes, Delilah Fairchild was one hundred percent pure woman. And one hundred percent, no-holds-barred beautiful. Beautiful and vivacious and used to commanding the attention of every man in the room. And that last bit made her all too familiar.</p> <p>Too familiar and too...dangerous. And honestly? His life-the one where he masqueraded as a motorcycle mechanic when in fact he was part of a clandestine government defense group that operated as the very tip of Uncle Sam's sword-was dangerous enough already, thank you very much.</p> <p>And speaking of familiar...</p> <p>Without warning, the unwelcome image of Jolene flashed behind his gritty eyes. Hair as black as a raven's wing. Eyes the color of Texas bluebonnets. Skin like buttermilk. And a heart as fickle and capricious as a Texas spring...</p> <p>He shook his head and blinked away the disturbing vision in time to see Zoelner raise a hand and call out to the bald, goateed man behind the bar. "Hey, Brendan! Where's the lovely lady of the house this evening? Not that my rather large, rather slow-talking friend here," Zoelner hooked a thumb in Mac's direction, "is wearing the sulky look of a eunuch in a whorehouse because he's missing her gorgeous face or anything. Because she's absolutely not his type."</p> <p>Right then, Mac made the supremely wise and incredibly mature decision to kick the former CIA agent's booted ankle. Zoelner turned to lift a dubious brow before he hauled off and kicked Mac right back. Which, of course, left Mac with no recourse but to respond with an even harder kick and soon they were scuffling like a couple of rowdy college frat boys instead of two highly trained operators. Then again, they were highly tipsy as well. So maybe that explained it.</p> <p>"Delilah's down south," Brendan said, coming to stand in front of them while continuing to wipe wet pint glasses with a dish towel. Short and squatty, Brendan had the physique of a wrestler and the face of a boxer-the bridge of his nose and his cheekbones looked like they'd been flattened more than a time or two by heavy fists. What he lacked in height, he obviously made up for in sheer scrappiness.</p> <p>"Where?" Zoelner asked, adjusting his leather jacket and shooting Mac a narrowed-eyed glare before turning his attention back to Brendan.</p> <p>"Southern Illinois," the bartender said, and Mac thought, Southern Illinois? What the hell is she doin' down there?</p> <p>"What the hell is she doing down there?"</p> <p>He blinked, startled. Had he asked the question aloud? Just how much scotch had he had?</p> <p>But no. It was Zoelner Brendan turned to to answer. Of course, Mac was forced to wonder again just how much scotch he'd had when, before any words had a chance to form on Brendan's tongue, the thought don't let her be down there visiting a lover whispered through the back of his brain.</p> <p>Whoa. What? Where the hell had that come from? He didn't give two shits what or...or...who she was doing down in southern Illinois.</p> <p>Did he?</p> <p>He couldn't help but notice his question was answered with resounding, cricket-chirping silence.</p> <p>Well, hell. That's just the booze talkin'. Because anything else was too disconcerting to contemplate.</p> <p>"Between you and me," Brendan said, leaning in conspiratorially, "I think she's trying to avoid the bar."</p> <p>What? Why?</p> <p>"What? Why?" Zoelner asked.</p> <p>Mac glared at the mind-reading man. "Who are you?" he demanded. "Carnac the Magnificent or somethin'?"</p> <p>"Huh?" Zoelner frowned at him in narrow-eyed affront. "Why are you scowling at me like that? Stop it, or that brown-haired Betty over there is going to think you just broke up with me."</p> <p>As a group, Mac, Zoelner, and Brendan all turned to smile at the woman in question. Zoelner raised his glass and wiggled his eyebrows, which elicited a seductive lowering of the Betty's lashes and a subtle quirk of one corner of her lacquered lips.</p> <p>"So why is Delilah avoiding the bar?" he asked, finding his way back on track more quickly than Mac. Of course, the instant That Woman's name was mentioned, every single thought in Mac's head focused on her like a blue-tick healer pointing out a covey of quail.</p> <p>Shit, shit, shit.</p> <p>"After Buzzard's murder," B...</p></p><h2>Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson, Black Visionary, Shaker Eldress</h2><p>Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson, Black Visionary, Shaker Eldress</p><p></p><h2>Crimea: The Last Crusade</h2><p>The terrible conflict that dominated the mid 19th century, the Crimean War killed at least 800,000 men and pitted Russia against a formidable coalition of Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire. It was a war for territory, provoked by fear that if the Ottoman Empire were to collapse then Russia could control a huge swathe of land from the Balkans to the Persian Gulf. But it was also a war of religion, driven by a fervent, populist and ever more ferocious belief by the Tsar and his ministers that it was Russia&#39;s task to rule all Orthodox Christians and control the Holy Land. Orlando Figes&#39; major new book reimagines this extraordinary war, in which the stakes could not have been higher and which was fought with a terrible mixture of ferocity and incompetence. It was both a recognisably modern conflict - the first to be extensively photographed, the first to employ the telegraph, the first &#39;newspaper war&#39; - and a traditional one, with illiterate soldiers, amateur officers and huge casualties caused by disease. Drawing on a huge range of fascinating sources, Figes also gives the lived experience of the war, from that of the ordinary British soldier in his snow-filled trench, to the haunted, gloomy, narrow figure of Tsar Nicholas himself as he vows to take on the whole world in his hunt for religious salvation.</p><p>Orlando Figes is Professor of History at Birkbeck College, University of London.

They came from every corner of Eastern Europe and the Middle East, from Egypt, Syria, Armenia, Anatolia, the Greek peninsula, but most of all from Russia, travelling by sea to the port of Jaffa where they hired camels or donkeys. By Good Friday, on 10 April 1846, there were 20,000 pilgrims in Jerusalem. They rented any dwelling they could find or slept in family groups beneath the stars. To pay for their long journey nearly all of them had brought some merchandise, a handmade crucifix or ornament, strings of beads or pieces of embroidery, which they sold to European tourists at the holy shrines. The square before the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the focus of their pilgrimage, was a busy marketplace, with colourful displays of fruit and vegetables competing for space with pilgrims' wares and the smelly hides of goats and oxen left out in the sun by the tanneries behind the church. Beggars, too, collected here. They frightened strangers into giving alms by threatening to touch them with their leprous hands. Wealthy tourists had to be protected by their Turkish guides, who hit the beggars with heavy sticks to clear a path to the church doors.In 1846 Easter fell on the same date in the Latin and Greek Orthodox calendars, so the holy shrines were much more crowded than usual, and the mood was very tense. The two religious communities had long been arguing about who should have first right to carry out their Good Friday rituals on the altar of Calvary inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the spot where the cross of Jesus was supposed to have been inserted in the rock. During recent years the rivalry between the Latins and the Greeks had reached such fever pitch that Mehmet Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Jerusalem, had been forced toposition soldiers inside and outside the church to preserve order. But even this had not prevented fights from breaking out.On this Good Friday the Latin priests arrived with their white linen altar-cloth to find that the Greeks had got there first with their silk embroidered cloth. The Catholics demanded to see the Greeks' firman, their decree from the Sultan in Constantinople, empowering them to place their silk cloth on the altar first. The Greeks demanded to see the Latins' firman allowing them to remove it. A fight broke out between the priests, who were quickly joined by monks and pilgrims on either side. Soon the whole church was a battlefield. The rival groups of worshippers fought not only with their fists, but with crucifixes, candlesticks, chalices, lamps and incense-burners, and even bits of wood which they tore from the sacred shrines. The fighting continued with knives and pistols smuggled into the Holy Sepulchre by worshippers of either side. By the time the church was cleared by Mehmet Pasha's guards, more than forty people lay dead on the floor.1'See here what is done in the name of religion!' wrote the English social commentator Harriet Martineau, who travelled to the Holy Lands of Palestine and Syria in 1846.This Jerusalem is the most sacred place in the world, except Mekkeh, to the Mohammedan: and to the Christian and the Jew, it is the most sacred place in the world. What are they doing in this sanctuary of their common Father, as they all declare it to be? Here are the Mohammedans eager to kill any Jew or Christian who may enter the Mosque of Omar. There are the Greeks and Latin Christians hating each other, and ready to kill any Jew or Mohammedan who may enter the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. And here are the Jews, pleading against their enemies, in the vengeful language of their ancient prophets.2The rivalry between the Christian Churches was intensified by the rapid growth in the number of pilgrims to Palestine in the nineteenth century. Railways and steamships made mass travel possible, opening up the region to tour-groups of Catholics from France and Italy and to the devout middle classes of Europe and America. The various Churches vied with one another for influence. They set up missions to support their pilgrims, competed over purchases of land, endowed bishoprics and monasteries, and established schools to convert the Orthodox Arabs(mainly Syrian and Lebanese), the largest but least educated Christian community in the Holy Lands.'Within the last two years considerable presents have been sent to Jerusalem to decorate the Church of the Holy Sepulchre by the Russian, French, Neapolitan and Sardinian governments,' reported William Young, the British consul in Palestine and Syria, to Lord Palmerston at the Foreign Office in 1839.There are many symptoms of increasing jealousy and inimical feeling among the churches. The petty quarrels that have always existed between the Latin, Greek and Armenian convents were of little moment so long as their differences were settled from time to time by the one giving a larger bribe to the Turkish authorities than the other. But that day passes by, for these countries are now no longer closed against European intrigue in church matters.3Between 1842 and 1847 there was a flurry of activity in Jerusalem: the Anglicans founded a bishopric; the Austrians set up a Franciscan printing press; the French established a consulate in Jerusalem and pumped money into schools and churches for the Catholics; Pope Pius IX re-established a resident Latin patriarch, the first since the Crusades of the twelfth century; the Greek patriarch returned from Constantinople to tighten his hold on the Orthodox; and the Russians sent an ecclesiastical mission, which led to the foundation of a Russian compound with a hostel, hospital, chapel, school and marketplace to support the large and growing number of Russian pilgrims.In the early decades of the nineteenth century, the Russian Orthodox Church sent more pilgrims to Jerusalem than any other branch of the Christian faith. Every year up to 15,000 Russian pilgrims would arrive in Jerusalem for the Easter festival, some even making the long trek on foot across Russia and the Caucasus, through Anatolia and Syria. For the Russians, the holy shrines of Palestine were objects of intense and passionate devotion: to make a pilgrimage to them was the highest possible expression of their faith.In some ways the Russians saw the Holy Lands as an extension of their spiritual motherland. The idea of 'Holy Russia' was not contained by any territorial boundaries; it was an empire of the Orthodox with sacred shrines throughout the lands of Eastern Christianity andwith the Holy Sepulchre as its mother church. 'Palestine', wrote one Russian theologian in the 1840s, 'is our native land, in which we do not recognize ourselves as foreigners.'4 Centuries of pilgrimage had laid the basis of this claim, establishing a link between the Russian Church and the Holy Places (connected with the life of Christ in Bethlehem, Jerusalem and Nazareth) which many Russians counted more important - the basis of a higher spiritual authority - than the temporal and political sovereignty of the Ottomans in Palestine.Nothing like this ardour could be found among the Catholics or Protestants, for whom the Holy Places were objects of historical interest and romantic sentiment rather than religious devotion. The travel writer and historian Alexander Kinglake thought that 'the closest likeness of a pilgrim which the Latin Church could supply was often a mere French tourist with a journal and a theory and a plan of writing a book'. European tourists were repelled by the intense passion of the Orthodox pilgrims, whose strange rituals struck them as 'barbaric' and as 'degrading superstitions'. Martineau refused to go to the Holy Sepulchre to see the washing of the pilgrims' feet on Good Friday. 'I could not go to witness mummeries done in the name of Christianity,' she wrote, 'compared with which the lowest fetishism on the banks of an African river would have been inoffensive.' For the same reason, she would not go to the ceremony of the Holy Fire on Easter Saturday, when thousands of Orthodox worshippers squeezed into the Holy Sepulchre to light their torches from the miraculous flames that appeared from the tomb of Christ. Rival groups of Orthodox - Greeks, Bulgarians, Moldavians, Serbians and Russians - would jostle with each other to light their candles first; fights would start; and sometimes worshippers were crushed to death or suffocated in the smoke. Baron Curzon, who witnessed one such scene in 1834, described the ceremony as a 'scene of disorder and profanation' in which the pilgrims, 'almost in a state of nudity, danced about with frantic gestures, yelling and screaming as if they were possessed'.5It is hardly surprising that a Unitarian such as Martineau or an Anglican like Curzon should have been so hostile to such rituals: demonstrations of religious emotion had long been effaced from the Protestant Church. Like many tourists in the Holy Land, they sensed that they had less in common with the Orthodox pilgrims, whose wildbehaviour seemed barely Christian at all, than with the relatively secular Muslims, whose strict reserve and dignity were more in sympathy with their own private forms of quiet prayer. Attitudes like theirs were to influence the formation of Western policies towards Russia in the diplomatic disputes about the Holy Land which would eventually lead to the Crimean War.Unaware of and indifferent to the importance of the Holy Lands to Russia's spiritual identity, European commentators saw only a growing Russian menace to the interests of the Western Churches there. In the early 1840s, Young, now the British consul, sent regular reports to the Foreign Office about the steady build-up of 'Russian agents' in Jerusalem - their aim being, in his view, to prepare a 'Russian conquest of the Holy Lands' through sponsored pilgrimage and purchases of land for Orthodox churches and monasteries. This was certainly a time when the Russi...</p><h2>The Yellow House Mystery (3) (Boxcar Children)</h2><p>The spooky old house on Surprise Island intrigues Benny.</p><p>This Boxcar Children Mystery is an exciting mystery that is easy and fun the read.Gertrude Chandler Warner was born in 1890 in Putnam, Connecticut, where she taught school and wrote The Boxcar Children because she had often imagined how delightful it would be to live in a caboose or freight car.

In the first decades of adulthood, he wrote a 15,145-page fictional epic, <i>In the Realms of the Unreal</i>. He spent much of the rest of his long life illustrating it in astonishing drawings and watercolors. In Darger's unfolding saga, pastoral utopias are repeatedly savaged by extreme violence directed at children, particularly girls. Given his disturbing subject matter and the extreme solitude he maintained throughout his life, critics have characterized Darger as eccentric, deranged, and even dangerous, as an outsider artist compelled to create a fantasy universe. Contesting such pathologizing interpretations, Michael Moon looks to Darger's resources, to the narratives and materials that inspired him and often found their way into his writing, drawings, and paintings. Moon finds an artist who reveled in the burgeoning popular culture of the early twentieth century, in its newspaper comic strips, pulp fiction, illustrated children's books, and mass-produced religious art. Moon contends that Darger's work deserves and rewards comparison with that of contemporaries of his, such as the "pulp historians" H. P. Lovecraft and Robert Howard, the Oz chronicler L. Frank Baum, and the newspaper cartoonist Bud Fisher.</p><p><p>Michael Moon is Professor in the Graduate Institute of the Liberal Arts at Emory University.

Clum), are also published by Duke University Press.</p>"<i>Darger's Resources </i>is a masterful, witty, and moving contribution to Americanist scholarship. It is also an important book, one which will significantly alter the terms of Darger criticism in art history and expand the vocabulary of queer theory in an urgently needed way. Michael Moon links the practice of recuperating texts from punishing or pathologizing interpretations to a context based more on class and religion than on sexuality. In doing so, he provides a model of how to export some of the best innovations of queer studies to other cultural and historical terrain. Moon uses his recuperation of Darger to open up vistas of working-class cultural history."&#x2014;<b>Christopher Nealon</b>, author of <i>Foundlings: Lesbian and Gay Historical Emotion before Stonewall</i><br><br>"<i>Darger's Resources</i> is an important, lively, and moving book.

When she first moved from London to the charming Cotswolds hills, she was heartily welcomed. She seemed a do-gooder par excellence, raising funds for the church and caring for the elderly. But she had a nasty habit of borrowing things and not giving them back, just small things, a teapot here, a set of silverware there. So it's quite the shock when she is found dead, murdered by a poisoned bottle of elderberry wine. Afraid the murder will be a blight on the small town, Parish councillor, Jerry Tarrant, hires private detective Agatha Raisin to track down the murderer.</p><p>But the village is secretive and the residents resent Agatha's investigation. Of course that doesn't stop the ever-persistent Agatha from investigating and sticking her nose where no one wants it&#x2015;especially as the suspect list grows.

Beaton</b> has been hailed as the "Queen of Crime" (<i>The Globe and Mail</i>). In addition to her <i>New York Times </i>and <i>USA Today </i>bestselling Agatha Raisin series&#x2015;now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television&#x2015;Beaton is the author of the Hamish Macbeth series and four Edwardian mysteries. Born in Scotland, she currently divides her time between the English Cotswolds and Paris.<i>Chapter One</i> <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>The recession was biting deeper into private detective Agatha Raisin&#x2019;s finances. The bread-and-butter work of her agency, the divorces, missing teenagers, even missing dogs and cats, was drying up as people preferred to go to the police for free help, and men and women in unhappy marriages opted to wait before paying Agatha to find proof of evidence for divorce. <br>Her agency staff consisted of two young people, Toni Gilmour and Simon Black, as well as retired policeman, Patrick Mulligan, elderly Phil Marshall, and secretary Mrs. Freedman. <br>Despite the hard times, Agatha could not bring herself to lay any of them off. She spent more time at her cottage in the village of Carsely in the Cotswolds, smoking, drinking gin and tonic and playing with her cats, Hodge and Boswell. Her ex-husband, James Lacey, who had the cottage next door, wrote travel books and was often absent, her police detective, Bill Wong, was too busy to call, and her other friend, Sir Charles Fraith, had not called on her for over a month. <br>So one sunny morning, instead of going into the office, she trudged up the road to the vicarage to pay a call on her closest friend, Mrs. Bloxby, the vicar&#x2019;s wife. The two women were in sharp contrast. Mrs. Bloxby wore old-fashioned &#x201c;lady&#x201d; clothes: drooping skirts and blouses in summer and washed-out woollens in winter. She had brown hair, mild eyes, and very beautiful hands. Agatha had bearlike eyes in a round face. She had very good skin and glossy brown hair worn short. Her figure was quite good apart from a rather thick waistline and her legs were excellent. <br>&#x201c;Come in, Mrs. Raisin,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just made some coffee. We can have it in the garden.&#x201d; Both women addressed each other by their second names, a practise once used by the now defunct Ladies Society. <br>Agatha sat in a chair in the sunny vicarage garden. Behind the garden wall lay the church graveyard, old mossy tombstones reminding one detective in her early fifties that life was fleeting. <br>Mrs. Bloxby came out to join her, carrying a tray with the coffee and a plate of Eccles cakes. <br>&#x201c;I made these this morning,&#x201d; said the vicar&#x2019;s wife. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love one but I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Agatha gloomily. &#x201c;All this inactivity is going straight to my waistline. Oh, what the hell!&#x201d; <br>She picked up a cake and bit into it. <br>Mrs. Bloxby looked at her friend anxiously. She felt she could hardly pray to God to send down a case for Agatha, as that possibly would involve a lot of misery for some people. Her husband often complained that people shouldn&#x2019;t pray for specifics, but, thought Mrs. Bloxby, there was often comfort in trying because the answer could be &#x201c;no&#x201d; but, on the other hand, something might happen. <br>Scotland Yard once claimed that some people are murderees. Mrs. Bloxby could not have imagined that in a village not far away from Carsely was a widow who would cause such hatred as to spur someone to murder her and give Agatha Raisin a new case. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Mrs. Gloria French lived in the village of Piddlebury, a charming place of old cottages, nestling in the Cotswold hills. She was a jolly widow with dyed blond hair, rosy cheeks and a raucous laugh. The perpetual smile on her wide mouth never quite reached her prominent pale blue eyes. She had recently moved to the Cotswolds from London and had thrown herself into village life with great energy. She baked cakes for the Women&#x2019;s Institute. She delivered the <i>Church Times.</i> She organised parties to raise money to repair the old church. In short, she seemed indefatigable. <br>Gloria&#x2019;s cottage had a thatched roof and latticed windows. The latticed windows were a recent addition, Gloria thinking that plain glass was not, well, <i>cottagey</i> enough. Nestling among the profusion of flowers in her garden were plastic gnomes. <br>Inside, the living room and kitchen were decorated with many copper pans and fake horse brasses. Some bad watercolours hung on the walls, Gloria being an enthusiastic amateur artist. &#x201c;If you are very good,&#x201d; she was fond of saying, &#x201c;I will give you one of my pictures,&#x201d; but the ungrateful villagers hoped they were never going to be considered good enough. <br>She favoured tight dresses of shiny material over a body stocking, giving her figure a sausage-like appearance. Gloria was determined to marry again. She ruthlessly pursued the few eligible men in the village with the exception of Jerry Tarrant, head of the parish council, who had complained about the amount of scent she wore by saying, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re supposed to get a whiff as we walk past you, not when we drive past you at sixty miles an hour,&#x201d; for Gloria sprayed herself daily from top to bottom in L&#x2019;Air Du Temps. <br>Everyone hoped she would settle down, as they were used to newcomers trying to take over and immersing themselves in what they believed was village life. <br>The vicar, Guy Enderbury, however, was delighted with her efforts. Not only had Gloria raised a healthy sum of money for the church restoration but also she read to the elderly and took them on shopping trips. <br>He found it hard to understand why she was becoming so unpopular, and appealed to his wife, Clarice. <br>Said Clarice, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s pushy, but it&#x2019;s not only that. She borrows things and doesn&#x2019;t give them back. When people ask for their belongings, she swears blind the items are her own property.&#x201d; <br>Such was the case. The items were hardly ever very expensive, a teapot here, a set of knives there, things like that. <br>Had she not been such a formidable character, people would have stopped lending her things, but when she loomed up on their doorsteps, they often weakly gave in, just wanting to be rid of her. <br>As Agatha was drinking coffee with Mrs. Bloxby, Gloria applied another slash of red lipstick to her large mouth and headed for the cottage of Peter Suncliff. Peter was a retired engineer and a widower. He was a tall powerful man in his early sixties with a good head of white hair and a craggy face. Gloria considered him top of her list as husband material. <br>He opened the door and looked down at Gloria. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; he demanded curtly. <br>&#x201c;The vicar&#x2019;s calling round and I am out of sherry,&#x201d; said Gloria. She tried to move past him, into his cottage, but he barred the way. &#x201c;I wondered if I could borrow a bottle.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need for that,&#x201d; said Peter. &#x201c;The village store is still open, or had you forgotten? They sell sherry. Or had you forgotten that as well?&#x201d; And, with that, he slammed the door in her face. <br>Gloria turned away, baffled. Then she thought he was probably shy and was frightened of betraying his real feelings. <br>She was just leaving when she was accosted by Jenny Soper. Jenny was also a widow, small and dainty, with a good figure and a round face with dimples under a head of curly black hair. &#x201c;Oh, Gloria,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Do you remember you borrowed a bag of flour from me? Do you mind replacing it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What? Oh, that? What&#x2019;s a bag of flour between friends?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We are not friends,&#x201d; said Jenny. <br>Gloria ignored her and strode on to the village stores. Jenny followed her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you,&#x201d; shouted Jenny, &#x201c;I want you to replace that bag of flour. Buy one now and give it to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I haven&#x2019;t enough money on me at the moment,&#x201d; said Gloria. &#x201c;Really, Jenny! You&#x2019;re all flushed. What a lot of fuss over a mere bag of flour.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a greedy cow!&#x201d; said Jenny. &#x201c;I wish someone would kill you!&#x201d; She stomped off. <br>Gloria beamed round at the startled villagers in the shop. &#x201c;Dear Jenny,&#x201d; she said, shaking her head. &#x201c;But there you are, the menopause takes women in odd ways.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Her be too young,&#x201d; said old Mrs. Tripp. &#x201c;Menopause, indeed. And don&#x2019;t you come reading to me no more. Hear?&#x201d; <br>Gloria looked at her, aghast. All the hours she had spent reading to that smelly old woman. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s more,&#x201d; said Mrs. Tripp, shuffling forward with the aid of two sticks, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re long past the change yourself, I does reckon.&#x201d; <br>Gloria could hardly believe her ears. She was in her early fifties and prided herself on looking at least ten years younger. <br>She smiled at the watching villagers. &#x201c;The heat does seem to be getting to everyone this morning.&#x201d; <br>They all turned their backs on her. Gloria was not sensitive, but even such as she felt an air of menace around her, a sort of menace that was as old as the Cotswold hills. <br>Unlike most Cotswold villages these days, which abound with outsiders, nearly all of the residents were from families who had lived in Piddlebury for generations. <br>Gloria hurriedly purchased a bottle of the cheapest sherry she could find and made her way home. <br>The phone was ringing when she entered her cottage and she rushed to answer it. <br>It was the vicar. &#x201c;My dear Mrs. French,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I am afraid I cannot join you this morning. Something has come up.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; demanded Gloria. <br>&#x201c;Parish business.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What kind of parish business?&#x201d; <br>Then clear as a bell, she could hear the vicar&#x2019;s wife shouting, &#x201c;Have you managed to put her off?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you next time I see you,&#x201d; said Guy Enderbury. &#x201c;Got to rush.&#x201d; <br>And then he rang off. <br>Gloria slowly replaced the receiver. She needed a drink. But not this filthy cheap sherry. She had the very thing down in the cellar. She went down the narrow stairs. On the floor lay a crate containing a few bottles of elderberry wine. She had organised the refreshments at a Bring &amp; Buy sale at the church hall a month ago. A local farmer&#x2019;s wife, Mrs. Ada White, had contributed the wine to be sold. Gloria, knowing the homemade wine to be especially good, had stolen the crate that Ada had put under the table as a reserve. One bottle at the corner of the crate had a printed label on it she had not noticed before. It read: VERY SPECIAL. <br>That&#x2019;ll do, thought Gloria. She lifted out a bottle and took it upstairs. <br>Pouring a large glass, she swallowed a greedy gulp and then gasped. She thought it must have gone off. Her body was racked with convulsions and she vomited violently. Then her bowels gave. She tried to get out of her armchair and reach the phone. But when she stood up, her legs gave out from under her and she fell to the ground. Her vision blurred and the room grew dark as she dragged herself into her small hallway. She made one last effort to raise herself up, but she slipped into a coma. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Three hours later, Jenny met Peter Suncliff in the main street. The village was really only made up of this one street. There were only two lanes leading off it. The cottages fronted straight onto the street without gardens. <br>&#x201c;How are you this morning, Jenny?&#x201d; asked Peter. <br>&#x201c;Still angry. That wretched French woman. She borrowed a bag of flour from me and won&#x2019;t give one back. She goes round the village, borrowing one thing or another, except it isn&#x2019;t borrowing, it&#x2019;s stealing. She never gives anything back. I mean, it&#x2019;s only a bag of flour but someone has to stand up to her.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come with you,&#x201d; said Peter, who had a soft spot for pretty Jenny. <br>They walked together to Gloria&#x2019;s cottage and rang the bell. Mrs. Ada White stopped beside them, a shopping basket over her arm. &#x201c;She often doesn&#x2019;t answer,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I know she stole my elderberry wine but when I went to see her, she wouldn&#x2019;t answer the door although I&#x2019;d seen her going in a few minutes before I rang the bell.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just leave it,&#x201d; said Jenny. <br>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s time she got a real lecture.&#x201d; Peter bent down and shouted through the letterbox. &#x201c;Open up! We know you&#x2019;re in there.&#x201d; <br>Then he straightened up, a worried frown on his face. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; asked Jenny. <br>He didn&#x2019;t answer but bent down again and this time looked through the letterbox. <br>He tried the door but it was locked. &#x201c;Call for an ambulance, Jenny,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s had a turn. I&#x2019;ll try to break in.&#x201d; <br>The front door had a glass panel. While Jenny dialled 999 on her mobile, Peter picked up a stone from the street and smashed the glass of the door. He gingerly put his arm through the hole he had made, found the lock and opened it. <br>Gloria&#x2019;s make-up stood out starkly against the clay of her face. He felt for a pulse but could not find one. <br>The ambulance took half an hour to arrive. People began to gather outside the cottages. <br>Two paramedics rushed in while Peter and Jenny waited nervously outside. <br>One of the paramedics came outside and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve called the police.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; asked Peter. <br>&#x201c;It looks like poisoning. Nothing must be touched.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Agatha read about it the following day in a local newspaper. Her interest quickened and then died. She could not afford to investigate any case where she could not earn any money. <br>At the week-end, she was morosely looking at her garden, feeling that she should try to weed some of the flowerbeds, and deciding to sit down and have a gin and tonic and a cigarette instead, when her doorbell rang. <br>When she opened the door, she found her friend Detective Sergeant Bill Wong on the doorstep. &#x201c;Come in!&#x201d; cried Agatha. &#x201c;I thought all my friends had forgotten me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Been very busy,&#x201d; said Bill. <br>Bill Wong had been Agatha&#x2019;s first friend when she had newly arrived to stay in the Cotswolds. He was the product of a Chinese father and a Gloucestershire mother. He had a round face and almond-shaped eyes and a pleasant local accent. <br>&#x201c;Drink?&#x201d; suggested Agatha, leading the way into the garden where her two cats, Hodge and Boswell, chased shadows across the shaggy lawn. <br>&#x201c;Too early for me and too early for you,&#x201d; said Bill, settling himself down in a garden chair. The cats rushed to give him a welcome. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s eleven o&#x2019; clock,&#x201d; snapped Agatha, &#x201c;and the pubs are open. Don&#x2019;t be a Puritan.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a coffee.&#x201d; <br>When Agatha returned with a mug of coffee, it was to find that Hodge had draped himself around Bill&#x2019;s neck while Boswell lay purring on his lap. Agatha looked sourly at the scene. Her cats only seemed glad to see her when it was feeding time. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s new?&#x201d; she asked, sitting down beside him. <br>&#x201c;An odd case over at Piddlebury.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, the suspected poisoning. Is it poisoning?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Seems like it. Still waiting for the results of the autopsy. A preliminary search shows that she had been drinking elderberry wine just before she died.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Some of that homemade stuff is enough to poison anyone,&#x201d; remarked Agatha. <br>&#x201c;But there is no sign of a glass or a bottle. There are about four bottles of the stuff in a crate in the cellar. They&#x2019;ve been taken away for analysis. The back door of the cottage was unlocked. Someone must have got in and removed the evidence.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Any suspects?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;None so far. She appears to have been the saint of the village, raising money for the church and doing good works all round.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Give it time,&#x201d; said Agatha cynically. &#x201c;At first, no one will speak ill of the dead. Was she rich?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Very comfortably off. Her house is worth at least half a million. She had a healthy amount of stock shares and a large bank balance. Her husband was owner of a company which manufactured Crispy Crisps, potato chips in all kinds of flavours.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So who inherits?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a son and daughter. But they both have alibis and were estranged from mother. Son Wayne was managing director of Crispy Crisps but when her husband died, Gloria sold off the whole business and left him without a job.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aha!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aha, nothing,&#x201d; said Bill gloomily. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got a good job as managing director of a rival company, Neat Nibbles. And he&#x2019;s only twenty-nine. On the day of her death, he was seen around the factory by hundreds of people.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What about the ...</p><h2>Transforming the Stone: Preaching Through Resistance to Change</h2><p>Barbara Lundblad contends that to preach is to engage a specific community of Christians in a process of gradual growth and change. While every parish has its unique attributes and needs, there are some basic dynamics at work in moving a congregation through resistance and toward transformation. Lundblad focuses our attention on these dynamics as she describes a program of preaching meant to re-fashion a people. The steps include building a foundation of grace, re-imaging Jesus, naming and honoring the wounds of community members, naming and removing obstacles to change, describing alternative futures, and daring hope. The author addresses each of these themes separately in chapters that include a brief introduction, two sample sermons, and a conclusion. This book for preachers provides a model for transformation preaching.</p><p>Barbara K. Lundblad is Joe R. Engle Associate Professor of Preaching at Union Theological Seminary in New York City.&nbsp; Rev. Lundblad has been heard regularly on the Protestant Hour for many years and is formerly pastor of an ELCU parish on the upper west side of Manhattan. She was chosen to deliver the Beecher lectures at Yale in October 2000.</p><h2>Leash (Native Agents)</h2><p><p><b>Leash extends the logic of S&amp;M to its inexorable and startling conclusion, darkly and hilariously revealing the masochistic impulse as the urge to disappear from the chores, obligations, and emotional vacuity of daily life.</b></p><p>No more jobs, no more taxes, no more checkbook, no more bills, no more credit cards, no more credit, no more money, no more mortgages, no more rent, no more savings, no more junk mail, no more junk, no more mail, no more phones, no more faxes, no more busy signals, no more computers, no more cars, no more drivers' licenses, no more traffic lights, no more airports, no more flying, no more tickets, no more packing, no more luggage, no more supermarkets, no more health clubs... While her "current" spends the summer researching public housing in Stockholm, a moderately wealthy, object-oppressed, and terminally hip New York female of a certain age seeks adventure in the sedate dyke bars of lower Manhattan. Finding none, she answers a personal ad. She is ordered to put on a blindfold before the first meeting with the woman she knows only as "Sir." Not knowing what someone looks like turns out to be freeing, as do the escalating constraints that alienate her not just from her former life, but from her very conception of who she is. Part Georges Bataille, part Fran Leibowitz, this is the Story of O told with a self-referentially perverse sense of humor.

First published in 2002.</p></p><p>Jane DeLynn is the author of <i>Don Juan in the Village</i>, <i>Real Estate</i>, and <i>Some Do</i>.A gay Manhattan writer explores her limits in DeLynn's latest, a surreal tale of submission and degradation that begins when the anonymous narrator's girlfriend takes a hiatus in Sweden, giving her a chance to play. She starts by cruising the local dyke bars, but when boredom sets in she dubs herself "Chris" and answers a personal ad from a "domme" who makes her don a blindfold for her first visit. Despite her fears and doubts, the relationship quickly progresses beyond the normal limits of dominance and submission as Chris is collared, forced into canine sex and then subjected to a wide variety of painful, kinky stimuli. Things get weirder when she is transformed into a "dog" by her "owner"; after leaving her normal life behind, Chris participates in a strange performance in which she is covered in plaster by an audience of her owner's peers. That act leads her into a world where women own each other in the manner of canines, and Chris is forced to leave behind her "mistress" and her old life. DeLynn is an ironic, thoughtful narrator who analyzes the psychological dependence and identity breakdown that can occur in such relationships, although her graphic descriptions will challenge the digestive systems of many readers. But the larger problem is that Chris remains one-dimensional despite DeLynn's brief efforts to flesh out her life as a writer, and that absence of contrast makes the s&amp;m material and the book seem lurid and cartoonish rather than alluring and exotic. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Crochet Geometry: Geometric Patterns to Fit and Flatter</h2><p>Crocheters in search of sophisticated designs will find what they&#x2019;re looking for in this chic, contemporary collection.

A preeminent legal scholar argues that reform guided by evidence, not politics and emotions, will reduce crime and reverse mass incarceration.</b></p><p>The United States has the world&#x2019;s highest rate of incarceration, a form of punishment that ruins lives and makes a return to prison more likely. As awful as that truth is for individuals and their families, its social consequences&#x2015;recycling offenders through an overwhelmed criminal justice system, ever-mounting costs, unequal treatment before the law, and a growing class of permanently criminalized citizens&#x2015;are even more devastating. With the authority of a prominent legal scholar and the practical insights gained through on-the-ground work on criminal justice reform, Rachel Barkow explains how dangerous it is to base criminal justice policy on the whims of the electorate, which puts judges, sheriffs, and politicians in office. Instead, she argues for an institutional shift toward data and expertise, following the model used to set food and workplace safety rules.</p><p>Barkow&#x2019;s prescriptions are rooted in a thorough and refreshingly ideology-free cost&#x2013;benefit analysis of how to cut mass incarceration while maintaining public safety. She points to specific policies that are deeply problematic on moral grounds and have failed to end the cycle of recidivism. Her concrete proposals draw on the best empirical information available to prevent crime and improve the reentry of former prisoners into society.</p><p><i>Prisoners of Politics</i> aims to free criminal justice policy from the political arena, where it has repeatedly fallen prey to irrational fears and personal interest, and demonstrates that a few simple changes could make us all safer.</p></p><p>Rachel Elise Barkow is the Segal Family Professor of Regulatory Law and Policy and the Faculty Director of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University.

More importantly, she provides a road map to a saner and more humane system&#x2015;a system built on facts, not on rhetoric and fear.

In a passionately argued book, Rachel Barkow documents the costly irrationalities that flow from populist policies, explains the skewed incentive structure that underlies them, and makes a compelling case for institutional reforms designed to ensure rational, cost-effective policy, robust constitutional checks, and a justice system oriented towards equitable public safety rather than mass incarceration.

They cruise down highway number 4 on their way to Shapeville, but they see an abandoned number along the way. Is it a 6? Is it a 9? And what's it doing on the side of the road? Once the trio reach Shapeville, there's another problem: a flood washed away all of the squares. Max and his brothers show the town that putting together two triangles will bring their shapes back together, and then they follow the residents on a trip to Count Town, where they put the missing number back in its place in the countdown to a rocket's blastoff. </p><p>This title has Common Core connections.</p></p><p><p><b>Kate Banks</b> is the author of many acclaimed books for children, including the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award winner <i>And If the Moon Could Talk.</i> She lives in the South of France. <br><b>Boris Kulikov </b>is the critically acclaimed illustrator of many children's books, including most recently <i>Papa's Mechanical Fish</i> by Candace Fleming. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p>K-Gr 2&#x2014;In the fourth story about Max and his two brothers, numbers and shapes take center stage instead of words. Max builds a car and tells his siblings he's off to look for problems, and soon all three are on their way to adventure. The boys prove to be quite helpful as they assist in rebuilding Shapetown after a storm and in locating the lost numbers required for a Count Town rocket launch. Kulikov's illustrations add much to the story and invite counting and simple problem solving while also demonstrating that shapes can be combined or divided to make other shapes. Max's car is pristine white, creating negative space, thus continuing the math theme, and the mayors of both towns resemble Albert Einstein and reflect the towns' names. Shapes and numbers are hidden throughout the brightly colored illustrations, offering seek-and-find games: on a cow, in the configuration of a road, a clockface. In order to get to sleep after his exciting day, Max counts sheep while lying under his patchwork quilt made up of various shapes. Young children will enjoy the familiar characters and the fact that the youngest of the three brothers is again their leader.&#x2014;Maryann H. Owen, Children's Literature Specialist, Mt.

Delivered at the University of G�ttingen in 1922, Barth's lectures offer a brilliant theological analysis of the Reformation &#x2014; of Calvin in particular &#x2014; while at the same time providing vital insights into the development of the theologian Barth himself.<br><br> Barth's lectures open with an illuminating sketch of medieval theology, an appreciation of Luther's breakthrough, and a comparative study of the roles of Zwingli and Calvin. The main portion of the lectures consists of an increasingly sympathetic, and at times amusing, account of Calvin's life up to his recall to Geneva. In the process, Barth examines and evaluates the early theological writings of Calvin, especially the 1536 edition of the&nbsp;<i>Institutes</i>.</p><p>(1886&#x2013;1968) Karl Barth was professor of dogmatictheology at the University of Basel, Switzerland. He isconsidered by some to be the greatest Protestant theologianof the twentieth century and possibly the greatest sincethe Reformation.

This is not unreasonable in view of the wide range of equipment suggested for the task, ranging from the complex (typically an industrial tool and cutter grinder) through to the humble off hand grinder. This book illustrates how most sharpening tasks can be carried out using an off hand grinder and a few simply made accessories to a standard comparable to that achieved using much more sophisticated equipment. Follow the instructions in this book and working with blunt tools will be a thing of the past! &#34;The Workshop Practice Series&#34; is the world&#39;s leading range of books for model engineers and mechanical crafts: some of the books have been in print for 50 years; most of them still reprint every 18 months.

Before Vasari&#x2019;s extraordinary book, art was considered a technical skill rather than an intellectual pursuit, and artists were mere decorators and craftsmen. It was through Vasari&#x2019;s visionary writings that artists like Raphael, Leonardo, and Michelangelo came to be regarded as great masters of life as well as art, their creative genius celebrated as a divine gift. Their enduring reputations testify to Vasari&#x2019;s profound yet unspoken influence on western culture.</p><p>An advisor to kings and pontiffs&#x2015;and a confidant to Titian, Donatello, and more&#x2015;Vasari enjoyed an exhilarating career amid the thrilling culture of Renaissance Italy. In <em>The Collector of Lives</em>, Ingrid Rowland and Noah Charney offer a lively and inviting introduction to this pivotal figure in art history, and immerse readers in the world of the Medici of Florence and the popes of Rome. A narrative of intrigue, scandal, and colorful artistic rivalry, this vivid biography shows the great works of western art taking shape under Vasari&#x2019;s keen eye&#x2015;and reveals how one Renaissance scholar completely redefined how we look at art.</p> 8 pages of color illustrations; 3 maps</p><p><p><strong>Ingrid Rowland</strong> is an award-winning author, a regular contributor to the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, and a professor of history, classics, art, and architecture at the University of Notre Dame, based in Rome.</p><p><strong>Noah Charney</strong> is an internationally best-selling author and professor of art history living in Slovenia.</p>&#x201c;Ingrid Rowland, a prominent scholar of Renaissance art and history, and her fellow writer and historian Noah Charney, wear their erudition lightly in their gracefully written biography.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Deborah Solomon, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Readers curious about the making of Renaissance art, its cast of characters and political intrigue, will find much to relish in these pages.

Through manifestoes, scores, interviews, notes and critical papers, performer/composers address composing, playing, improvising, teaching and thinking in and through music, Rather than an attempt to distill or define musicans' work, Arcana is a remarkable book--challenging and original--essential for composers, musicians, theorists and fans alike. Edited by John Zorn, it includes contributions from Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot (on earplugs), Ikue Mori (on drum machines), Bob Ostertag (on a string quartet) There's a discussion on plunderphonics with John Oswald, an overview from Elliott Sharp on his group Carbon, and David Mahler expounds his responses to a set of nine questions posed by Pauline Oliveros. The writings range from brief 2 or 3 page entries (Mike Patton's "How We Eat Our Young," Marilyn Crispell's "Elements of Improvisation") to long and elaborate essays (Scott Johnson's "Counterpoint," David Rosenboom's "Propositional Music"). Some of the contributions are more unusual, such as Zorn's "Treatment for a Film in Fifteen Scenes," Fred Frith's notebook extracts, or Peter Garland's journal of his trip to Australia's Northern Territory. All of them provide for inspiring and thought-provoking reading, making this an invaluable book for both fans of these artists and aspiring musicians of the avant garde. An appendix of brief bios for each artist ends the book, along with short lists of recommended listenings.</p></p><p>John Zorn is a central figure in New York&#39;s music community.

There&#x2019;s no handrail, either. Just wooden steps and plaster walls that were probably added in an attic renovation long ago. The door above remains shut, but there&#x2019;s a sliver of light that escapes through the bottom, coming from inside. He must&#x2019;ve left the window uncovered.<br> The door looks darker than the walls of the stairway, but it&#x2019;s hard to tell from this angle, without light, that it&#x2019;s blue. We painted it during the summer from a half-empty can he&#x2019;d found in the garage, a color called Rustic Sea.<br> <i>&#x201c;A complicated color for a complicated door,&#x201d; he joked.

We painted it all the way around&#x2014;front and back and sides&#x2014;and sometimes, the door still sticks when you pull it open. Like the paint dried too thick, too slowly.<br> There&#x2019;s a speck of paint on the silver doorknob that I&#x2019;ve never noticed before, and it makes me pause. I run my thumb over the roughness of the spot, wondering how I missed this.<br> I take a slow breath, trying to remember the room before I see it, to prepare.<br> It&#x2019;s got four walls, a closet, slanting ceilings before they meet at a flat strip overtop. There&#x2019;s a fan hanging from the middle of that strip, the kind that rattles when it&#x2019;s set to the highest speed. Shelves built into the walls on both sides, giving way to a sliding closet door on my left. A single window, on the far wall.<br> There&#x2019;s a bed, with a green comforter.<br> A desk to my right, with a computer monitor on the surface, the tower hidden below.<br> The walls are gray and the carpet is . . . the carpet is brown. I think. I&#x2019;m no longer sure. The color blurs and shifts in my mind.<br> It&#x2019;s just a room. Any room. Four walls and a ceiling and a fan.<br> This is what I tell myself before I step inside. This is the whisper I hear in my head as I stand with my hand on the knob, waiting on the top step.<br> For a moment, I think I hear his footsteps on the other side of the door, but I know this isn&#x2019;t possible. I picture us sitting across from each other on the floor. My legs, angled between his.&nbsp;<br> He leans closer. He&#x2019;s smiling.<br> Then I remember: the carpet is beige. The door will squeak as I push it open. The air will be hotter or colder than the rest of the house, depending on the time of year.<br> All these things I know by heart.<br> None of this prepares me.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Under My Skin: Volume One of My Autobiography, to 1949</h2><p><p>"I was born with skins too few. Or they were scrubbed off me by...robust and efficient hands." </p><p>The experiences absorbed through these "skins too few" are evoked in this memoir of Doris Lessing's childhood and youth as the daughter of a British colonial family in Persia and Southern Rhodesia Honestly and with overwhelming immediacy, Lessing maps the growth of her consciousness, her sexuality, and her politics, offering a rare opportunity to get under her skin and discover the forces that made her one of the most distinguished writers of our time. </p></p><p><p>Winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, Doris Lessing was one of the most celebrated and distinguished writers of our time, the recipient of a host of international awards. She wrote more than thirty books&#x2014;among them the novels <em>Martha Quest</em>, <em>The Golden Notebook</em>, and <em>The Fifth Child</em>. She died in 2013.</p>As is to be expected from Lessing (The Real Thing, 1992, etc.), whose clear and always intelligent no-nonsense writing has explored subjects that transcend the commonplace, this first volume of her autobiography reflects all her remarkable strengths. The year of her birth, 1919, was auspicious neither for her parents in particular nor for the world in general. The ill-matched Taylers had married not out of love but out of a mutual need to expunge the horror of the recently ended world war, which had maimed Lessing's father both physically and mentally--he'd lost a leg in battle, but more important, he was embittered by what he considered Britain's poor treatment of her soldiers. Her mother, an able nurse, had lost a fianc&#x201a;, and marriage now seemed to offer only the consolation of children. These disappointments, exacerbated by the harsh life in rural Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia), where her family settled after a stint in Persia, would indelibly shape Lessing. She quarreled frequently with her mother, whose well-meaning strictures she resented; observed her father's despair and his failures as a settler-farmer; and resolved that she would not live like them--``I will not, I will not!''--even if it meant defying convention. Which she did, as she left her first husband and their two children for another man--Gottried Lessing; joined the local Communist Party in the midst of WW II ``because of the spirit of the times, because of the Zeitgeist''; and then moved in 1949 permanently to London. Like so many bright and alienated provincials, Lessing found an escape in voracious reading. Though determined to be a writer, the consuming distractions of motherhood, wartime society, and political activities frustrated this ambition for a long time. Refreshingly, not a self-indulgent mea culpa, but a brutally frank examination of how Lessing became what she is--a distinguished writer, a woman who has lived life to the full, and a constant critic of cant.

Prayer . . . meditation . . . speaking in tongues. What do these spiritual activities share and how do they differ? Why do some people believe in God, while others embrace atheism? From the ordinary to the extraordinary, beliefs give meaning to the mysteries of life. They motivate us, provide us with our individual uniqueness, and ultimately change the structure and function of our brains. In Born to Believe, Andrew Newberg, MD, and Mark Waldman reveal -- for the very first time -- how our complex views, memories, superstitions, morals, and beliefs are created by the neural activities of the brain. Supported by groundbreaking original research, they explain how our brains construct our deepest convictions and fondest assumptions about reality and the world around us. Using science, psychology, and religion, the authors offer recommendations for exercising your brain in order to develop a more life-affirming, flexible range of attitudes. Knowing how the brain builds meaning, value, spirituality, and truth into your life will change forever the way you look at yourself and the world.</p><p><b>Andrew Newberg, MD</b>, is an associate professor of Radiology and Psychiatry and an adjunct assistant professor of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, and also director of the Center for Spirituality and the Mind.

His body was riddled with tumors, his liver and spleen were enlarged, his lungs were filled with fluid, and he needed an oxygen mask to breathe. But when Mr. Wright heard that his doctor was conducting cancer research with a new drug called Krebiozen, which the media were touting as a potential miracle cure, he pleaded to be given treatments. Although it was against protocol, Dr. Klopfer honored Mr. Wright's request by giving him an injection of the drug, then left the hospital for the weekend, never expecting to see his patient again. But when he returned on Monday morning, he discovered that Mr. Wright's tumors had shrunk to half their original size, something that even radiation treatments could not have accomplished.</p><p>"Good God!" thought Dr. Klopfer. "Have we finally found the silver bullet -- a cure for cancer?" Unfortunately, an examination of the other test patients showed no changes at all. Only Mr. Wright had improved. Was this a rare case of spontaneous remission, or was some other unidentified mechanism at work? The doctor continued to give injections to his recovering patient, and after ten days practically all signs of the disease had disappeared. Wright returned home, in perfect health.</p><p>Two months later, the Food and Drug Administration reported that the experiments with Krebiozen were proving ineffective. Mr. Wright heard about the reports and immediately became ill. His tumors returned, and he was readmitted to the hospital. Now, Dr. Klopfer was convinced that the patient's belief in the drug's effectiveness had originally healed him. To test his theory, he decided to lie, telling Mr. Wright about a "new, super-refined, double-strength product" that was guaranteed to produce better results. Mr. Wright agreed to try this "new" version of what he believed had healed his tumors before, but in reality, Dr. Klopfer gave him injections of sterile water.</p><p>Once again, Mr. Wright's recovery was dramatic. His tumors disappeared, and he resumed his normal life -- until the newspapers published an announcement by the American Medical Association under the headline "Nationwide Tests Show Krebiozen to Be a Worthless Drug in Treatment of Cancer."</p><p>After reading this, Mr. Wright fell ill again, returned to the hospital, and died two days later. In a report published in the Journal of Projective Techniques, Dr. Klopfer concluded that when the power of Wright's optimistic beliefs expired, his resistance to the disease expired as well.</p><p>Each year, thousands of cases of remarkable recoveries are described, and although such "miracles" are often attributed to the power of faith and belief, the majority of scientists are skeptical of such claims. In the medical literature, spontaneous remissions -- at least when cancer is involved -- are extremely rare. Estimates range from one case in 60,000 to one in 100,000, although a definitive overview of the topic argues that perhaps one patient in 3,000 experiences a spontaneous remission. Moreover, the majority of oncologists believe that an unidentified biological mechanism is at work rather than a true miracle; and current hypotheses favor alterations in the body's cellular, immunological, hormonal, and genetic functioning over psychological mechanisms. But Mr. Wright's case is unique -- and one of the few to be documented during a university research project. The remissions of his cancer have been attributed to the effects of his mind on the biological functioning of his body -- in other words, on the biology of belief.</p><p>Hundreds of mind-body experiments have been conducted -- including placebo studies and research on the power of meditation and prayer -- but few scientists have attempted to explain the underlying biology of belief. We have volumes of comprehensive statistics about the kinds of beliefs we hold, but our understanding of how and why belief "works" is still in its infancy, and most conclusions are still controversial.</p><p>Fortunately, recent discoveries about the ways the brain creates memories, thoughts, behaviors, and emotions can provide a new template with which to examine the how and why of belief. What I will propose in this book is a practical model of how the brain works that will help you understand your own beliefs and the nature of reality. It will also help you see how all beliefs emerge from the perceptual processes of the brain, and how they are shaped by personal relationships, societal influences, and educational and spiritual pursuits. This understanding can then help us to discern the difference between destructive and constructive beliefs, skills that are essential if we are to adequately address important individual, interpersonal, and global problems.</p><p>Beliefs govern nearly every aspect of our lives. They tell us how to pray and how to vote, whom to trust and whom to avoid; and they shape our personal behaviors and spiritual ethics throughout life. But once our beliefs are established, we rarely challenge their validity, even when faced with contradictory evidence. Thus, when we encounter others who appear to hold differing beliefs, we tend to dismiss or disparage them. Furthermore, we have a knee-jerk tendency to reject others who are not members of our own group. Even when their belief systems are fundamentally similar to ours, we still feel that they are significantly different. For example, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all embrace similar notions of God, yet according to one poll nearly one-third of Americans believe that each of these religious groups worships a different deity. Even though a close investigation of the world's religions will show that the majority of human beings share similar ethical values, we tend to ignore the similarities and focus on the discrepancies. Ignorance is only partly to blame. A more significant reason is that our brains are instinctually prone to reject information that does not conform to our prior experience and knowledge. Simply put, old beliefs, like habits, die hard.</p><p>This book is also about our biological quest for meaning, spirituality, and truth. If we understand the neuropsychology of the brain, our beliefs will be able to grow and change as we interact with others who have different views of the world. It is my hope that as we become better believers, we will exercise greater compassion in our search for meaning and truth.</p><p>The study of human beliefs often raises unsettling issues, since most people are not aware that many of our beliefs are based on incomplete assumptions about the world. How, then, can beliefs be so powerful that they can heal us, or so destructive that they can cause us to suffer and die? This question has haunted philosophers, theologians, and politicians for a long time, and I myself have struggled to answer it for most of my medical career. For me, it all began with my own questions about the nature of reality and God.</p><p>Reality, Dreams, and Beliefs</p><p>As a teenager, I often wondered why people believed certain things. Some of my friends believed in God while others did not, but no one could give a strong enough argument to change anyone else's mind. Similar stalemates occurred when our conversations touched on issues of evolution, the origin of the universe, or more captivating topics such as basketball and girls. For the most part, our opinions (except for those about girls) never changed. In our debates, it didn't even matter what the facts were; if they didn't support our beliefs, we dismissed them. Nonetheless, I was never certain about what I should or shouldn't believe, because both sides seemed to have valid points. I knew that there was always some study, tucked away in a forgotten crevice at the library, that could support even the most outrageous claim.</p><p>By the time I finished high school, I began to think that I would never be able to know what was true or false. I even used to wonder, as teenagers are prone to do, if the world itself was real. Maybe everything was nothing more than a dream. In college, I came across the following poem paying homage to a Chinese sage born 300 years before Jesus:</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Chuang Tzu dreamed he was a butterfly. What joy, floating on the breeze. Without a thought of who he was.</i></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><i>When Chuang Tzu awoke, he found himself confused."Am I a man who dreamed I was a butterfly?Or am I a butterfly, dreaming that I am a man?Perhaps my whole life is but a moment in a butterfly's dream!"</i></blockquote><p>So I was not alone in my ruminations about reality. When I discovered that many physicists also doubt that we will ever know the true nature of the universe, I began to wonder how anyone could trust his or her beliefs. For that matter, why did people believe in anything at all? What is this impulse to believe?</p><p>Eventually, I realized that if I was to have any hope of understanding why people believe what they do, I would have to study the part of us that actually does the believing -- the human mind -- for no matter what we see, feel, think, or do, it must all be processed through the brain. After years of study, I have come to see that a profound chasm exists between the world "out there" and our internal consciousness, and that this fundamental disconnection prevents us from ever truly "knowing" reality. Still, we seem to have little choice but to trust our neural perceptions.</p><p>We are born to believe because we have no other alternative. Because we can never get outside ourselves, we must make assumptions -- usually lots of them -- to make sense of the world "out there." The spiritual beliefs we adhere to and the spiritual experiences we can have are also influenced by our neural circuitry and its limitations. God may exist, but we could experience God -- or anything else, for that matter -- only through the functioning of our brains.</p><p>In my previous book, <i>Why God Won't Go Away</i>, I began to address our perception of God and other spiritual beliefs by studying the brain processes that occur during meditation, prayer, and spiritual experiences. ...</p></p><h2>Choosing Raw: Making Raw Foods Part of the Way You Eat</h2><p>After her health journey led her to a plant-based diet, Gena Hamshaw started a blog for readers of all dietary stripes looking for a common&#x2013; sense approach to healthy eating and fuss&#x2013;free recipes. <i>Choosing Raw</i>, the book, does in an in depth manner what the blog has done for hundreds of thousands of readers: addresses the questions and concerns for any newcomer to veganism; makes a plant&#x2013;based diet with many raw options feel easy instead of intimidating; provides a starter kit of delicious recipes; and offers a mainstream, scientifically sound perspective on healthy living.<br><br>With more than 100 recipes, sumptuous food photos, and innovative and wholesome meal plans sorted in levels from newcomer to plantbased pro, Hamshaw offers a simple path to health and wellness.

Dr. Eben Alexander was one of those scientists. A highly trained neurosurgeon, Alexander knew that NDEs feel real, but are simply fantasies produced by brains under extreme stress.<br><br>Then, Dr. Alexander&#x2019;s own brain was attacked by a rare illness. The part of the brain that controls thought and emotion&#x2014;and in essence makes us human&#x2014;shut down completely. For seven days he lay in a coma. Then, as his doctors considered stopping treatment, Alexander&#x2019;s eyes popped open. He had come back.<br> <br>Alexander&#x2019;s recovery is a medical miracle. But the real miracle of his story lies elsewhere. While his body lay in coma, Alexander journeyed beyond this world and encountered an angelic being who guided him into the deepest realms of super-physical existence. There he met, and spoke with, the Divine source of the universe itself.<br> <br>Alexander&#x2019;s story is not a fantasy. Before he underwent his journey, he could not reconcile his knowledge of neuroscience with any belief in heaven, God, or the soul. Today Alexander is a doctor who believes that true health can be achieved only when we realize that God and the soul are real and that death is not the end of personal existence but only a transition.<br> <br>This story would be remarkable no matter who it happened to. That it happened to Dr. Alexander makes it revolutionary. No scientist or person of faith will be able to ignore it.

The first few inches happened automatically. But soon I&#x2019;d notice that the higher I got, the more my progress depended on me&#x2014;on what <i>I</i> did. If I got too excited, too swept away by the experience, I would plummet back to the ground . . . hard. But if I played it cool, took it all in stride, then off I would go, faster and faster, up into the starry sky.<br> <br>Maybe those dreams were part of the reason why, as I got older, I fell in love with airplanes and rockets&#x2014;with anything that might get me back up there in the world above this one. When our family flew, my face was pressed flat to the plane&#x2019;s window from takeoff to landing. In the summer of 1968, when I was fourteen, I spent all the money I&#x2019;d earned mowing lawns on a set of sailplane lessons with a guy named Gus Street at Strawberry Hill, a little grass strip &#x201c;airport&#x201d; just west of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the town where I grew up. I still remember the feeling of my heart pounding as I pulled the big cherry-red knob that unhooked the rope connecting me to the towplane and banked my sailplane toward the field. It was the first time I had ever felt truly alone and free. Most of my friends got that feeling in cars, but for my money being a thousand feet up in a sailplane beat that thrill a hundred times over.<br> <br>In college in the 1970s I joined the University of North Carolina sport parachuting (or skydiving) team. It felt like a secret brotherhood&#x2014;a group of people who knew about something special and magical. My first jump was terrifying, and the second even more so. But by my twelfth jump, when I stepped out the door and had to fall for more than a thousand feet before opening my parachute (my first &#x201c;ten second delay&#x201d;), I knew I was home. I made 365 parachute jumps in college and logged more than three and a half hours in free fall, mainly in formations with up to twenty-five fellow jumpers. Although I stopped jumping in 1976, I continued to enjoy vivid dreams about skydiving, which were always pleasant.<br> <br>The best jumps were often late in the afternoon, when the sun was starting to sink beneath the horizon. It&#x2019;s hard to describe the feeling I would get on those jumps: a feeling of getting close to something that I could never quite name but that I knew I had to have more of. It wasn&#x2019;t solitude exactly, because the way we dived actually wasn&#x2019;t all that solitary. We&#x2019;d jump five, six, sometimes ten or twelve people at a time, building free-fall formations. The bigger and the more challenging, the better.<br> <br>One beautiful autumn Saturday in 1975, the rest of the UNC jumpers and I teamed up with some of our friends at a paracenter in eastern North Carolina for some formations. On our penultimate jump of the day, out of a D18 Beechcraft at 10,500 feet, we made a ten-man snowflake. We managed to get ourselves into complete formation before we passed 7,000 feet, and thus were able to enjoy a full eighteen seconds of flying the formation down a clear chasm between two towering cumulus clouds before breaking apart at 3,500 feet and tracking away from each other to open our chutes.<br> <br>By the time we hit the ground, the sun was down. But by hustling into another plane and taking off again quickly, we managed to get back up into the last of the sun&#x2019;s rays and do a second sunset jump. For this one, two junior members were getting their first shot at flying into formation&#x2014;that is, joining it from the outside rather than being the base or pin man (which is easier because your job is essentially to fall straight down while everyone else maneuvers toward you). It was exciting for the two junior members, but also for those of us who were more seasoned, because we were building the team, adding to the experience of jumpers who&#x2019;d later be capable of joining us for even bigger formations.<br> <br>I was to be the last man out in a six-man star attempt above the runways of the small airport just outside Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina. The guy directly in front of me was named Chuck. Chuck was fairly experienced at &#x201c;relative work,&#x201d; or RW&#x2014;that is, building free-fall formations. We were still in sunshine at 7,500 feet, but a mile and a half below us the streetlights were blinking on. Twilight jumps were always sublime and this was clearly going to be a beautiful one.<br> <br>Even though I&#x2019;d be exiting the plane a mere second or so behind Chuck, I&#x2019;d have to move fast to catch up with everyone. I&#x2019;d rocket straight down headfirst for the first seven seconds or so. This would make me drop almost 100 miles per hour faster than my friends so that I could be right there with them after they had built the initial formation.<br> <br>Normal procedure for RW jumps was for all jumpers to break apart at 3,500 feet and track away from the formation for maximum separation. Each would then &#x201c;wave off&#x201d; with his arms (signaling imminent deployment of his parachute), turn to look above to make sure no others were above him, then pull the rip cord.<br> <br>&#x201c;Three, two, one . . . go!&#x201d;<br> <br>The first four jumpers exited, then Chuck and I followed close behind. Upside down in a full-head dive and approaching terminal velocity, I smiled as I saw the sun setting for the second time that day. After streaking down to the others, my plan was to slam on the air brakes by throwing out my arms (we had fabric wings from wrists to hips that gave tremendous resistance when fully inflated at high speed) and aiming my jumpsuit&#x2019;s bell-bottomed sleeves and pant legs straight into the oncoming air.<br> <br>But I never had the chance.<br> <br>Plummeting toward the formation, I saw that one of the new guys had come in too fast. Maybe falling rapidly between nearby clouds had him a little spooked&#x2014;it reminded him that he was moving about two hundred feet per second toward that giant planet below, partially shrouded in the gathering darkness. Rather than slowly joining the edge of the formation, he&#x2019;d barreled in and knocked everybody loose. Now all five other jumpers were tumbling out of control.<br> <br>They were also much too close together. A skydiver leaves a super-turbulent stream of low-pressure air behind him. If a jumper gets into that trail, he instantly speeds up and can crash into the person below him. That, in turn, can make both jumpers accelerate and slam into anyone who might be below <i>them</i>. In short, it&#x2019;s a recipe for disaster.<br> <br>I angled my body and tracked away from the group to avoid the tumbling mess. I maneuvered until I was falling right over &#x201c;the spot,&#x201d; a magical point on the ground above which we were to open our parachutes for the leisurely two-minute descent.<br> <br>I looked over and was relieved to see that the disoriented jumpers were now also tracking away from each other, dispersing the deadly clump.<br> <br>Chuck was there among them. To my surprise, he was coming straight in my direction. He stopped directly beneath me. With all of the group&#x2019;s tumbling, we were passing through 2,000 feet elevation more quickly than Chuck had anticipated. Maybe he thought he was lucky and didn&#x2019;t have to follow the rules&#x2014;exactly.<br> <br><i>He must not see me</i>. The thought barely had time to go through my head before Chuck&#x2019;s colorful pilot chute blossomed out of his backpack. His pilot chute caught the 120-mph breeze coming around him and shot straight toward me, pulling his main parachute in its sleeve right behind it.<br> <br>From the instant I saw Chuck&#x2019;s pilot chute emerge, I had a fraction of a second to react. For it would take less than a second to tumble through his deploying main parachute, and&#x2014;quite likely&#x2014;right into Chuck himself. At that speed, if I hit his arm or his leg I would take it right off, dealing myself a fatal blow in the process. If I hit him directly, both our bodies would essentially explode.<br> <br>People say things move more slowly in situations like this, and they&#x2019;re right. My mind watched the action in the microseconds that followed as if it were watching a movie in slow motion.<br> <br>The instant I saw the pilot chute, my arms flew to my sides and I straightened my body into a head dive, bending ever so slightly at the hips. The verticality gave me increased speed, and the bend allowed my body to add first a little, then a blast of horizontal motion as my body became an efficient wing, sending me zipping past Chuck just in front of his colorful blossoming Para-Commander parachute.<br> <br>I passed him going at over 150 miles per hour, or 220 feet per second. Given that speed, I doubt he saw the expression on my face. But if he had, he would have seen a look of sheer astonishment. Somehow I had reacted in microseconds to a situation that, had I actually had time to think about it, would have been much too complex for me to deal with.<br> <br>And yet . . . I <i>had</i> dealt with it, and we both landed safely. It was as if, presented with a situation that required more than its usual ability to respond, my brain had become, for a moment, superpowered.<br> <br>How had I done it? Over the course of my twenty-plus-year career in academic neurosurgery&#x2014;of studying the brain, observing how it works, and operating on it&#x2014;I have had plenty of opportunities to ponder this very question. I finally chalked it up to the fact that the brain is truly an extraordinary device: more extraordinary than we can even guess.<br> <br>I realize now that the real answer to that question is much more profound. But I had to go through a complete metamorphosis of my life and worldview to glimpse that answer. This book is about the events that changed my mind on the matter. They convinced me that, as marvelous a mechanism as the brain is, it was not my brain that saved my life that day at all. What sprang into action the second Chuck&#x2019;s chute started to open was another, much deeper part of me. A part that could move so fast because it was not stuck in time at all, the way the brain and body are.<br> <br>This was the same part of me, in fact, that had made me so homesick for the skies as a kid. It&#x2019;s not only the smartest part of us, but the deepest part as well, yet for most of my adult life I was unable to believe in it.<br> <br>But I do believe now, and the pages that follow will tell you why.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m a neurosurgeon.<br> <br>I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1976 with a major in chemistry and earned my M.D. at Duke University Medical School in 1980. During my eleven years of medical school and residency training at Duke as well as Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard, I focused on neuroendocrinology, the study of the interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine system&#x2014;the series of glands that release the hormones that direct most of your body&#x2019;s activities. I also spent two of those eleven years investigating how blood vessels in one area of the brain react pathologically when there is bleeding into it from an aneurysm&#x2014;a syndrome known as cerebral vasospasm.<br> <br>After completing a fellowship in cerebrovascular neurosurgery in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in the United Kingdom, I spent fifteen years on the faculty of Harvard Medical School as an associate professor of surgery, with a specialization in neurosurgery. During those years I operated on countless patients, many of them with severe, life-threatening brain conditions.<br> <br>Most of my research work involved the development of advanced technical procedures like stereotactic radiosurgery, a technique that allows surgeons to precisely guide beams of radiation to specific targets deep in the brain without affecting adjacent areas. I also helped develop magnetic resonance image&#x2013;guided neurosurgical procedures instrumental in repairing hard-to-treat brain conditions like tumors and vascular disorders. During those years I also authored or coauthored more than 150 chapters and papers for peer-reviewed medical journals and presented my findings at more than two hundred medical conferences around the world.<br> <br>In short, I devoted myself to science. Using the tools of modern medicine to help and to heal people, and to learn more about the workings of the human body and brain, was my life&#x2019;s calling. I felt immeasurably lucky to have found it. More important, I had a beautiful wife and two lovely children, and while I was in many ways married to my work, I did not neglect my family, which I considered the other great blessing in my life. On many counts I was a very lucky man, and I knew it.<br> <br>On November 10, 2008, however, at age fifty-four, my luck seemed to run out. I was struck by a rare illness and thrown into a coma for seven days. During that time, my entire neocortex&#x2014;the outer surface of the brain, the part that makes us human&#x2014;was shut down. Inoperative. In essence, absent.<br> <br>When your brain is absent, you are absent, too. As a neurosurgeon, I&#x2019;d heard many stories over the years of people who had strange experiences, usually after suffering cardiac arrest: stories of traveling to mysterious, wonderful landscapes; of talking to dead relatives&#x2014;even of meeting God Himself.<br> <br>Wonderful stuff, no question. But all of it, in my opinion, was pure fantasy. What caused the otherworldly types of experiences that such people so often report? I didn&#x2019;t claim to know, but I did know that they were brain-based. All of consciousness is. If you don&#x2019;t have a working brain, you can&#x2019;t be conscious.<br> <br>This is because the brain is the machine that produces consciousness in the first place. When the machine breaks down, consciousness stops. As vastly complicated and mysterious as the actual mechanics of brain processes are, in essence the matter is as simple as that. Pull the plug and the TV goes dead. The show is over, no matter how much you might have been enjoying it.<br> <br>Or so I would have told you before my own brain crashed.<br> <br>During my coma my brain wasn&#x2019;t working improperly&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t working <i>at all</i>. I now believe that this might have been what was responsible for the depth and intensity of the near-death experience (NDE) that I myself underwent during it. Many of the NDEs reported happen when a person&#x2019;s heart has shut down for a while. In those cases, the neocortex is temporarily inactivated, but generally not too damaged, provided that the flow of oxygenated blood is restored through cardiopulmonary resuscitation or reactivation of cardiac function within four minutes or so. But in my case, the neocortex was out of the picture. I was encountering the reality of a world of consciousness that existed <i>completely free of the limitations of my physical brain</i>.<br> <br>Mine was in some ways a perfect storm of near-death experiences. As a practicing neurosurgeon with decades of research and hands-on work in the operating room behind me, I was in a better-than-average position to judge not only the reality but also the <i>implications</i> of what happened to me.<br> <br>Those implications are tremendous beyond description. My experience showed me that the death of the body and the brain are not the end of consciousness, that human experience continues beyond the grave. More important, it continues under the gaze of a God who loves and cares about each one of us and about where the universe itself and all the beings within it are ultimately going.<br> <br>The place I went was real. Real in a way that makes the life we&#x2019;re living here and now completely dreamlike by comparison. This doesn&#x2019;t mean I don&#x2019;t value the life I&#x2019;m living now, however. In fact, I value it more than I ever did before. I do so because I now see it in its true co...</p><h2>Co-creating at Its Best: A Conversation Between Master Teachers</h2><p>What happens when you bring together one of the most inspirational spiritual teachers of all time and the Master Sages of the Universe?

He was never seen again. In <i>A Brilliant Darkness</i>, theoretical physicist Jo�o Magueijo tells the story of Majorana and his research group, the Via Panisperna Boys,&#x201d; who discovered atomic fission in 1934. As Majorana, the most brilliant of the group, began to realize the implications of what they had found, he became increasingly unstable. Did he commit suicide that night in Palermo? Was he kidnapped? Did he stage his own death?<p><i>A Brilliant Darkness</i> chronicles Majorana's invaluable contributions to science including his major discovery, the Majorana neutrino while revealing the truth behind his fascinating and tragic life.</p></p><p><b>Joao Magueijo</b> has taught at Cambridge University, Princeton University, and the University of California, Berkeley.

But what simple terms can illuminate a tortured and unstable personality, vulnerable to bouts of depression and prone to antisocial reclusiveness? The complexities of that personality resist assimilation into any of the standard explanations suicide, kidnapping, flight, monastic retreat for Majorana's disappearance. But astounded readers will thank Magueijo for his daring venture into the science and the psyche of a perplexing figure.&#x201d;<br><br></p><h2>The Nautical Sextant</h2><p>The Nautical Sextant reveals in pictures, prose, and perspective the experience and knowledge gained by the author from years of acquiring, studying, and restoring sextants from earlier times and from around the world. This fascinating book owes much of its attraction to the expert description and photos of the mechanics of the sextants and their subassemblies. It is also the story of how different manufacturers, in different times and places, solved the same mechanical problems in different ways in order to perfect one of the most accurate mechanical devices ever produced by man. All of this is complemented by an historical overview to the current day, an overview which has never been published until now. The Nautical Sextant will be of particular value not only to navigators, but also to restorers, collectors, students of technology, curators, and sextant dealers. With its bibliography and extensive use of footnotes, this book will certainly become a classic in its field.</p><p>Born in the UK and educated at Cambridge University, W.J. Morris has spent most of his working life practicing medicine in New Zealand. Since retiring, he has fully indulged his interest in sextants and other fine measuring instruments. He has written numerous articles for laymen on engineering workshop technology and has restored many aircraft and nautical sextants to working order.Even landsmen who take an interest in scientific instruments and precision measurement will find this book of absorbing interest. There has never been anything quite like it before, and it will become the standard work for a long time to come. --George Huxtable, Fellow of the Royal Institute of Navigation<br><br>This comprehensive work is the definitive word on the nautical sextant. Its abundant photographs and diagrams dispel the intimidation that confronts navigators when faced with repairing, or even adjusting, their sextants. The details of sextants their makes and models, construction, repairs, and history are not only interesting in themselves, but may tempt many to venture into restoration and collection of these fine, enduring instruments. --John Karl, Author, Celestial Navigation in the GPS Age<br><br>Old sextants need not die. Using Bill Morris s book, any celestial navigation enthusiast who owns a distressed or weather-worn sextant one that isn t quite an antique and not yet junk can resurrect it with these amazingly detailed instructions. With this book, you can tear down and rebuild a sextant and bring it back to perfect working order. But even for those of us who would never imagine doing such surgery on an old sextant, this book is like a Grey s Anatomy of the components, construction, and inner workings of these instruments. And it s not just the intimate anatomy of one species of sextant The Nautical Sextant is a comparative anatomy of a whole zoology of sextants. I highly recommend it. --Frank Reed, Navigation Historian<br><br>This comprehensive work is the definitive word on the nautical sextant.

This spirited collection of previously neglected or unpublished essays, articles, short stories, travel sketches, and criticism represents every aspect and period of Chatwin&#x2019;s career as it reveals an abiding theme in his work: his fascination with, and hunger for, the peripatetic existence. While Chatwin&#x2019;s poignant search for a suitable place to &#x201c;hang his hat,&#x201d; his compelling arguments for the nomadic &#x201c;alternative,&#x201d; his revealing fictional accounts of exile and the exotic, and his wickedly <i>en pointe</i> social history of Capri prove him to be an excellent observer of social and cultural mores, Chatwin&#x2019;s own restlessness, his yearning to be on the move, glimmers beneath every surface of this dazzling body of work.</p><p>The dangling ends of Bruce Chatwin&#39;s writing career were posthumously tied together by Jan Borm and Matthew Graves in a collection of 17 previously neglected or unpublished essays, articles, short stories, and travel tales. They span 20 years of writing, yet common threads emerge: his compulsive storytelling, the endless lure of the remote, and his keen sense of place. Borm and Graves have compiled a wonderful gift for the many Chatwin fans who miss him.Bruce Chatwin (1940&#x2013;1989) was the author of <b>In Patagonia</b>, <b>The Viceroy of Ouidah</b>, <b>On the Black Hill</b>, <b>The Songlines</b>, and <b>Utz</b>.

The lost story of feminine Christianity is here enriched for the first time by the historical context of each woman&#39;s life and her fresh literary expression of spiritual reality. Hildegard of Bingen, Hadewijch of Antwerp, Beatrice of Nazareth, Mechthild of Magdeburg, and Marguerite Porete were acknowledged handmaidens of God&#39;s prophetic spirit. Their teaching, solidly based in theological and metaphysical culture, was even thought superior to that of the scholastic doctors of the time. &#34;Flowing Light of the Godhead,&#34; &#34;The Seven Manners of Love,&#34; and &#34;The Mirror of Simple Annihilated Souls,&#34; written in the vernacular, foreshadowed the works of Meister Eckhart. Ruysbroeck the Admirable, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, and many other mystics. In the, clear, vigorous language of these long-suppressed works, readers of today can rediscover the primacy of love and imagination over pure intellect. Women Mystics in Medieval Europe is an important work of reference for Christians and spiritual seekers as well as an inspirational resource for those who aspire to &#34;see without an intermediary what God is.&#34;</p><p>EMILIE ZUM BRUNN was Director of Research at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris.Georgette Epiney-Burgard is a specialist in Medieval Dutch literature, language and spirituality.Sheila Hughes taught English language and literature at the British Institute of Rome and Rome University.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>In the Midst of Perpetual Fetes: The Making of American Nationalism, 1776-1820 (Published by the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture and the University of North Carolina Press)</h2><p>In this innovative study, David Waldstreicher investigates the importance of political festivals in the early American republic. Drawing on newspapers, broadsides, diaries, and letters, he shows how patriotic celebrations and their reproduction in a rapidly expanding print culture helped connect local politics to national identity. Waldstreicher reveals how Americans worked out their political differences in creating a festive calendar. Using the Fourth of July as a model, members of different political parties and social movements invented new holidays celebrating such events as the ratification of the Constitution, Washington's birthday, Jefferson's inauguration, and the end of the slave trade. They used these politicized rituals, he argues, to build constituencies and to make political arguments on a national scale. While these celebrations enabled nonvoters to participate intimately in the political process and helped dissenters forge effective means of protest, they had their limits as vehicles of democratization or modes of citizenship, Waldstreicher says. Exploring the interplay of region, race, class, and gender in the development of a national identity, he demonstrates that an acknowledgment of the diversity and conflict inherent in the process is crucial to any understanding of American politics and culture.<br><br></p><p>"Standard reading just three years after publication . . .

But Stephen Hinshaw never imagined that a profound secret was kept under lock and key for 18 years within his family&#x2015;that his father&#x2019;s mysterious absences, for months at a time, resulted from serious mental illness and involuntary hospitalizations. From the moment his father revealed the truth, during Hinshaw&#x2019;s first spring break from college, he knew his life would change forever.</p><p> Hinshaw calls this revelation his &#x201c;psychological birth.&#x201d; After years of experiencing the ups and downs of his father&#x2019;s illness without knowing it existed, Hinshaw began to piece together the silent, often terrifying history of his father&#x2019;s life&#x2015;in great contrast to his father&#x2019;s presence and love during periods of wellness. This exploration led to larger discoveries about the family saga, to Hinshaw&#x2019;s correctly diagnosing his father with bipolar disorder, and to his full-fledged career as a clinical and developmental psychologist and professor.</p><p> In <i>Another Kind of Madness</i>, Hinshaw explores the burden of living in a family &#x201c;loaded&#x201d; with mental illness and debunks the stigma behind it. He explains that in today&#x2019;s society, mental health problems still receive utter castigation&#x2015;too often resulting in the loss of fundamental rights, including the inability to vote or run for office or automatic relinquishment of child custody. Through a poignant and moving family narrative, interlaced with shocking facts about how America and the world still view mental health conditions well into in the 21st century, <i>Another Kind of Madness</i> is a passionate call to arms regarding the importance of destigmatizing mental illness.</p></p><p><b>Stephen Hinshaw</b> is a professor of psychology at UC Berkeley and of psychiatry at UC San Francisco.

Stephen Hinshaw's memoir of growing up in a home infused by the stresses -- and secrets -- of a father's long-misdiagnosed mental illness is alternately poignant and painful, yet always on the mark. With remarkable honesty and unflinching immediacy, he allows us to accompany him as he grows from a frightened child to a determined advocate and healer, taking on illness and stigma alike while wrestling with the residue of his complex family legacy. This book is a must-read for anyone grappling with serious mental illness and its fallout on families.

The Comb is an upthrust ridge of sandstone-virtually a mini-mountain range-that stretches almost unbroken for a hundred miles from just east of Kayenta, Arizona, to some ten miles west of Blanding, Utah. To hike the Comb is to run a gauntlet of up-and-down severities, with the precipice lurking on one hand, the fiendishly convoluted bedrock slab on the other-always at a sideways, ankle-wrenching pitch. There is not a single mile of established trail in the Comb's hundred-mile reach.<br>The friends were David Roberts, writer, adventurer, famed mountaineer of decades past, at age 61 the graybeard of the bunch; Greg Child, renowned mountaineer and rock climber, age 47; and Vaughn Hadenfeldt, a wilderness guide intimately acquainted with the canyonlands, age 53. They came to the Comb not only for the physical challenge, but to seek out seldom-visited ruins and rock art of the mysterious Anasazi culture. Each brought his own emotions on the journey; the Comb Ridge would test their friendship in ways they had never before experienced.<br>Searching for the stray arrowhead half-smothered in the sand or for the faint markings on a far sandstone boulder that betokened a little-known rock art panel, becomes a competitive sport for the three friends. Along the way, they ponder the mystery, bringing the accounts of early and modern explorers and archaeologists to bear: Who were the vanished Indians who built these inaccessible cliff dwellings and pueblos, often hidden from view? Of whom were they afraid and why? What caused them to suddenly abandon their settlements around 1300 AD? What meaning can be ascribed to their phantasmagoric rock art? What was their relationship to the Navajo, who were convinced the Anasazi had magical powers and could fly?<br></p><p><table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> <td><p><strong>DAVID ROBERTS</strong> is an accomplished mountaineer and the author of more than twenty books, including several published by The Mountaineers Books (<em>Escape Routes, Moments of Doubt, Sandstone Spine</em>) as well as many others, including <em>True Summit</em> (about Herzog and Annapurna) and <em>The Last of His Kind</em>, a biography of Bradford Washburn.

Following an introductory chapter on color photography in the nineteenth century, seven uniformly structured chapters discuss the most commercially or historically significant processes of the twentieth century&#x2014;additive color screen, pigment, dye imbibition, dye coupling, dye destruction, dye diffusion, and dye mordanting and silver toning&#x2014;offering readers a user-friendly guide to materials, methods of identification, and common kinds of deterioration. A final chapter presents specific guidelines for collection management, storage, and preservation. There is also a glossary of technical terms, along with appendixes presenting detailed chronologies for Kodachrome and Ektachrome transparencies, Cibachrome/Ilfochrome printing materials, and Instant films.<br><br>This book will interest instructors and students in classroom settings; conservators, registrars, curators, archivists, and collection caretakers; and anyone else concerned with the long-term preservation of color photographs.</p></p><p><p>Sylvie P�nichon is a conservator of photographs at the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth.

It sheds new light on a problem central in modern Western thought. Yuasa shows that Eastern philosophy has generally formulated its view of mind-body unity as an achievement a state to be acquired&#x2015;rather than as essential or innate. Depending on the individual&#x2019;s own developmental state, the mind-body connection can vary from near dissociation to almost perfect integration. Whereas Western mind-body theories have typically asked what the mind-body is, Yuasa asks how the mind-body relation varies on a spectrum from the psychotic to the yogi, from the debilitated to the athletic, from the awkward novice to the master musician.<br><br>Yuasa first examines various Asian texts dealing with Buddhist meditation, kundalini yoga, acupuncture, ethics, and epistemology, developing a concept of the &#x201c;dark consciousness&#x201d; (not identical with the psychoanalytic unconscious) as a vehicle for explaining their basic view. He shows that the mind-body image found in those texts has a striking correlation to themes in contemporary French phenomenology, Jungian psychoanalysis, psychomatic medicine, and neurophysiology. The book clears the ground for a provocative meeting between East and West, establishing a philosophical region on which science and religion can be mutually illuminating.</p><p><p>Yuasa Yasuo is Professor of Comparative Thought and Director of the Japanology program at Tsukuba University in Japan.

(Both she and the photographer understand the dogs are in charge.)CHAPTER ONE<br><br> Early January<br><br> New Orleans<br><br> It had once been a lovely kitchen, with pale wood and granite, a pretty view of a courtyard garden, and an enormous refrigerator still dotted with photographs of what looked like a big, happy family. Father, mother, daughter, sons, and an enormous black dog, big enough for the kids to ride on.<br><br> But they were long gone now, cleared out like nearly everyone else in New Orleans when Paranormals flooded into our world, leaving most of our city and much of the South in ruins.<br><br> I was searching through what they'd left behind, looking for a diamond in the rough.<br><br> "There is a house in New Orleans . . ."<br><br> I winced at the throaty croak that echoed from the other end of the kitchen. "Like a frog being strangled," I muttered.<br><br> "They call the Rising Sun!"<br><br> I leaned around the cabinet door. "Moses!"<br><br> Inside the pantry, something thudded, rolled. "What? I'm working here."<br><br> "The singing."<br><br> A head, small and pale, with glossy black horns and irritable green eyes, peered around the pantry door. "What about it?"<br><br> "It's not great."<br><br> He snorted, doubt written across his face. "Says you."<br><br> "Yeah, says me."<br><br> Moses walked out of the pantry, three feet of Paranormal attitude. And, for the five weeks we'd been sneaking around New Orleans, my best friend.<br><br> "Someone might hear you," I reminded him.<br><br> He grumbled a curse, walked through the shadowed kitchen in my direction. He held up a bloated silver can, its seams bursting from age, heat, and rot. By the size, I guessed it was tuna fish. Very gnarly tuna fish.<br><br> "Jackpot," Moses said.<br><br> "You aren't going to eat that," I said. "It's spoiled."<br><br> "Don't be persnickety." He sniffed at the metal, closed his eyes in obvious pleasure. "More flavor this way." He held it out. "You want a sniff?"<br><br> My stomach flipped in revolt. "I do not. It would probably kill me."<br><br> He waved off the concern. "I've done this tons of times. Maybe I just have a stronger constitution than you, Claire."<br><br> "Hmm," I said noncommittally. Better to avoid going too far down that rabbit hole.<br><br> Moses was supposed to be locked up in Devil's Isle, the prison for Paras and anyone else touched by magic. Some Paras had wanted our world for their own; others, like Moses, had been forced to fight via magical conscription. Unfortunately, the Paranormal Combatant Command, the federal agency in charge of Paras, didn't much care about that detail.<br><br> I was a Sensitive, a human affected by magic that had seeped in from the Beyond. That magic gave me telekinesis, but at a cost: Too much magic would destroy my mind and body. Keeping that balance was a trick I was trying to master.<br><br> I'd kept my power secret until a cult called Reveillon-people who believed magic in any form, including the city's remaining Paranormals, should be eradicated-had attacked Devil's Isle. I'd had to use my magic to bring down Reveillon's founder. The PCC now considered me its enemy-and didn't get the irony.<br><br> There were signs the PCC might eventually come to its senses, acknowledge that magic wasn't all bad and not all Paranormals had been our enemies on purpose. It had even authorized temporary leave for a select few Paranormals who'd fought in the Battle of Devil's Isle.<br><br> Sensitives like me hadn't gotten the same consideration. We weren't Paras, and we weren't humans. We were different. Paras couldn't become wraiths-the pale, skeletal monsters into which Sensitives transformed if we failed to control our magic, to balance all that heady power. If we weren't careful, the magic would corrupt us, turn us into twisted creatures obsessed with absorbing more and more power. <br><br> So despite my efforts in the battle, there'd be no pass for me. I was too unpredictable, too dangerous, too untrustworthy.<br><br> Moses, having already snuck out of Devil's Isle and having skipped out again during the battle, didn't need a pass. He was already on the lam.<br><br> We'd tried playing the game, helping Containment, the PCC unit in charge of Devil's Isle, track down Reveillon and fighting on their side. And except for the few token passes, nothing had changed.<br><br> So we'd been sneaking around New Orleans, working to avoid Containment. And since they were treating us like criminals, we figured we'd might as well act like criminals. We'd decided our job was to challenge the PCC and its refusal to acknowledge the truth about magic, about Paranormals, about Sensitives.<br><br> Along with the other members of our crew, which we called Delta, we'd been covering Reveillon's antimagic billboards with our own messages, using contacts outside the war Zone to rally the rest of the world to our side and gathering supplies for the Devil's Isle clinic.<br><br> The facility-and the wraiths secured there-weren't on Containment's priority list. Reveillon's attacks had put a big crimp in the PCC's supply chain, so even if the clinic had been on that list, consumables were getting harder to come by. We were in this house to gather up what we could for delivery to Lizzie, who ran the clinic.<br><br> Moses walked toward the kitchen island with his slightly sideways gait, then slung a mesh bag of equally swollen cans onto the granite countertop and added his newest find to it. "You find anything?"<br><br> It took me a moment to reorient. I closed the cabinet, held up a carton of sea salt and a tin of tea bags. "Salt's half full, and the tea bags still smell mostly like tea." No small feat, given they'd been stewing in heat and humidity. "Still," I said, "you'd think there'd be more here."<br><br> "It's a nice house," he said, glancing around the room. "It would have been one of the first ones sacked after the war-or during the battle."<br><br> "Yeah," I said.<br><br> Reveillon had ransacked Devil's Isle-and every neighborhood the members had blown through along the way. They'd been like a hurricane scouring their way across New Orleans. Not the first storm the Big Easy had faced down. But over time, hell and high water took their toll.<br><br> Reveillon's members had hurt the city and those who lived here-and some, including Liam Quinn, didn't live here anymore. The bounty hunter I'd fallen for had been hit by magic, and he'd left New Orleans to fight his resulting demons.<br><br> I hadn't heard from him since.<br><br> I knew Liam was with his grandmother Eleanor in what Malachi called the "southern reach," the bayous and marshes of southern Louisiana, where small communities of Paras worked to stay out of Containment's crosshairs-and out of Devil's Isle.<br><br> Malachi, another of my Paranormal friends, had told us that much when he'd returned from reuniting Liam and Eleanor.<br><br> But that was all I knew about Liam's location or the effects of the magical hit he'd taken. It was a point of pride that I hadn't asked Malachi for any more details, for updates as one week after another passed. I'd tried to force thoughts of Liam to the back of my mind, giving him the time and space he apparently needed. In the meantime, I'd focused on Delta, on our new work for New Orleans, on controlling my magic. Because even though I knew why he'd gone, it still hurt to be left behind.<br><br> I put my hands on my hips and sighed as I looked at our meager harvest. "Oh, well. You add it to the bottled water, the aspirin, the radio. That's something."<br><br> "It's something," he said. "You know they don't take things for granted."<br><br> They hadn't. If anything, they'd been too grateful, and that didn't make me feel any better about Containment or our situation.<br><br> "Oh, found one more thing," Moses said, pulling something from the bib of his denim overalls. He'd found the overalls during a previous scavenger hunt. They were way too big for him-the pants rolled up at the bottom-but he loved that front pocket.<br><br> He moved toward me, offered his hand. In his small, meaty palm sat a silver robot with a square body perched on blocky feet. Probably three inches long, with a canister-shaped head topped by a tiny antenna. A metal windup key emerged from its back.<br><br> "It was wedged behind a drawer," Moses said.<br><br> "It's old," I said, taking it gingerly and looking-as my father had taught me-for a manufacturer's mark or date, but I didn't find anything. "Probably from the fifties or sixties." That was much older than the fancy cabinets and countertops in there. "Must have missed it when they renovated the house. Let's fire it up." Carefully, I cranked the key, listened to the gears catch and lock, then set the toy on the countertop.<br><br> The gears buzzed like hornets as it moved forward, its feet rotating in sequence, the little antenna bobbing. We watched silently as it marched to the end of the countertop. Moses caught it before it reached the end, turned it around, and sent it back in my direction.<br><br> "Huh," he said, monitoring its progress with surprising affection in his eyes. "I like that."<br><br> "Yeah," I said, "so do I."<br><br> We wound it again and let the toy repeat its parade across the granite.<br><br> "Shame they missed it when they left," he said.<br><br> "What did they miss?"<br><br> We both turned sharply, found a man behind us.<br><br> Malachi was tall, over six feet, with the broad shoulders of a soldier. He looked like an angel: tousled blond curls that reached his shoulders, a square jaw, luminous ivory wings that folded and magically disappeared while we watched, and eyes of shimmering gold. That gold was a signature of some Paranormals-and it was the color I'd seen in Liam's eyes after he'd been hit and before he'd run.<br><br> Malachi had been a general in the Consularis army-the caste of Paras who'd ruled the Beyond before the war, the same Paras who'd been magically conscripted to fight us by their enemies, the Court of Dawn.<br><br> We hadn't heard the usual thush of wings that signaled Malachi had alighted-and apparently walked right through the front door. He wore jeans, boots, and a faded Loyola T-shirt.<br><br> Malachi smiled at Moses, then let his gaze linger on me. My heart met that look, delivered by a man beautiful enough to be carved in marble and preserved for eternity, with an answering thump. It was an instinctive response, triggered by the sheer power of his gaze.<br><br> Paras had very different conceptions of romance and attraction. We were just friends-even if we'd become better friends over the last few weeks-but that didn't make his power any less potent.<br><br> "They missed our new toy," I said, answering his question. I wound it again and set it to work.<br><br> "Ah," he said, then picked it up to study it. "An automaton."<br><br> "Or humans' sixty-year-old idea of one. How'd you find us?"<br><br> "We followed the sound of mating cats," Malachi said, sliding a sly smile to Moses.<br><br> Moses lifted his middle finger. "I got your mating cats right here."<br><br> I guess the gesture translated. Good to know. "We?" I asked.<br><br> "Someone wanted to talk." He glanced back as footsteps echoed on the hardwood floors at the other end of the shotgun house.<br><br> A man stepped into the doorway, his figure only a shadow in the harsh sunlight behind him.<br><br> For a moment, I was lost in memory, back at Royal Mercantile, my store in the French Quarter. Or it had been, before I'd been forced to abandon it. In my mind, I was in an antique bed on a rough-hewn floor, a slip of a breeze coming through the windows and a man sleeping next to me. Dark hair. Blue eyes. Body lean and honed like a weapon.<br><br> The man I'd fought beside.<br><br> The man who'd left.<br><br> Then he took a step forward. Memory faded, putting another man in the doorway. Similar to the one who'd left, but not the same.<br><br> "Gavin," Moses said.<br><br> This wasn't Liam, but his brother. But it was still surprising that he was standing here with Malachi. I hadn't seen him since the battle.<br><br> "Claire. Mos."<br><br> "What are you doing here?" I asked.<br><br> Gavin didn't waste any time. "Jack Broussard is dead."<br><br> Broussard was a Containment agent, and a generally despicable human.<br><br> "No loss there," Moses said.<br><br> "Maybe not," Gavin replied. "But they're saying Liam killed him."<br><br> CHAPTER TWO<br><br> "Liam's not in New Orleans," Malachi said simply. "He couldn't have done it."<br><br> "There's supposedly physical evidence he did," Gavin said. "And Liam and Broussard had a bad history. That seems to be enough."<br><br> Liam was a bounty hunter, or had been, and Broussard had been his handler before their relationship had soured. Because Liam understood Paranormals weren't all our enemies, Broussard believed Liam was a traitor to humankind. That was the kind of attitude Delta was fighting against.<br><br> "Tell us what happened," Moses said, crossing his arms.<br><br> "Broussard didn't show up for a shift at the Cabildo," Gavin said. Containment headquartered in the historic building on Jackson Square. "Containment sent someone to take a look, and they found him in his house. It was bloody. His throat had been slit." He paused, seemed to collect himself. "The knife was one of Liam's-a hunting knife I gave him. Had an engraved blade. And 'For Gracie' was scrawled on the wall-in Broussard's blood."<br><br> The silence was heavy, mixed with eddies of horror and fury.<br><br> Gracie was Gavin and Liam's late sister, a young woman killed by wraiths. Her death had haunted them, and that was one of the obstacles that had stood between me and Liam.<br><br> Moses narrowed his eyes. "Someone's setting your brother up."<br><br> "That's how it reads to me."<br><br> "Bastards," Moses spat. "Scum-sucking bastards for using your sister like that."<br><br> "Yeah," Gavin said, running a hand through his hair. "I can't argue with that."<br><br> "Why set Liam up?" I asked. "Containment doesn't have anything against him-or didn't. Do they know he has magic?"<br><br> "Not that I'm aware of," Gavin said.<br><br> "Maybe Containment didn't arrange the frame-up," Malachi said. "Maybe the killer did. He or she could have a vendetta against Liam, or may not care who's blamed, as long as it's directed away from him or her."<br><br> "Yeah," Gavin said with a heavy sigh. He looked tired, I realized, his skin a little paler than usual, his eyes shadowed with fatigue. "I lean toward that. Containment's issued a bounty for him."<br><br> "Gunnar wouldn't do that." Gunnar Landreau was second-in-command at Containment, and one of my best friends.<br><br> "He wouldn't have a choice," Gavin said. "An agent's been murdered, and the evidence points to Liam.

Ozzie and Harriet are gone. And with them, the idea that the traditional marriage is the only right way. Yet, today&#x2019;s couples are also discovering that the &#x201c;roleness&#x201d; marriage in which everything is equal, with no distinction between male and female, isn&#x2019;t all that satisfying either. Rocking the Roles examines what the Bible really has to say about the male and female roles. A far cry from the restrictions of the traditional marriage or the formlessness of modern marriage, this approach offers a perfect blend of structure and equality, balance and beauty. It explores: 1) Common myths and misunderstanding about marriage roles 2) &#x2018;Core&#x2019; roles that don&#x2019;t limit choices but help prioritize commitments, energy, and time 3) What husbands and wives most need to understand about each other 4) What the &#x201c;S&#x201d; word-submission-is and is not 5) Spiritual leadership as practical responsibility, not privileged rank 6) How to transform your marriage by applying these practical, biblical principles to day-to-day life. So if you want a marriage in which fairness, respect, and support operate equally between you and your partner, it&#x2019;s time for Rocking the Roles-and for discovering God&#x2019;s radical, inspired, and timeless design for lasting marriage.ROBERT LEWIS is the teaching pastor of Fellowship Bible Church in Little Rock, Arkansas.

She cannot remember a time when she has not loved and trusted him and followed where he led. At first the marriage is happy; it is only after their child is stillborn that Richard shows preliminary signs of religious fanaticism in his insistence that this is God's punishment visited upon them. The Shaker missionaries newly arrived in Kentucky find him an easy convert. <br><br>When Richard joins the Shaker community, Rebecca goes with him, as a dutiful wife should, hoping that her love will ultimately win him back to her and to the larger world.

Two people exited a bar nearby, laughing too loud before piling into an SUV and steering drunkenly onto the road.<br><br>In the shadows of a weed-ridden parking lot at the back of the rundown motel, no one noticed them. Avoiding the glow of the full yellow moon, they stood behind the south wall beneath a broken security lamp.<br><br>A lamp Dare Macintosh had broken.<br><br>Ocean breezes stirred the air and heightened his senses. While scanning the area and repeatedly peering at the black van he'd rented when first arriving in San Diego, Dare waited. His friend, Trace Rivers, embraced his younger sister with choking emotion.<br><br>It had been a long two days filled with frantic preparation, little sleep, less food and loads of pumping adrenaline: the conditions in which Dare operated best.<br><br>With the job done, and then some, he desperately wanted something to eat and a place to sleep. Even more than that, he wanted to check on the skinny, abused woman still out cold in the backseat of the van.<br><br>"Tell me," Trace said, not to Alani, whom he kept crushed close, but to Dare.<br><br>After again glancing at the van, Dare nodded. He'd<br><br>found Alani and returned her to Trace as he'd sworn to, but neither man knew yet what she had suffered.<br><br>"She was in Tijuana, as you said. Locked in a trailer with some other women in an isolated area."<br><br>"Heavily guarded?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Trace drew a strained breath, and uttered what they both had known: "Human traffickers."<br><br>Dare nodded. "Not much in the way of food or drinks. Dirty, airless with the windows screwed shut. They had the women..." He hesitated, knowing how Trace would take it, but he needed to know. "They were leashed, chained to grommets in the floor, with just enough chain to reach a toilet. No sink."<br><br><em>"Fuckers." </em>Overcome with rage, Trace knotted his hand in his sister's hair and squeezed her tighter, protectively.<br><br>She didn't complain.<br><br>Trace never used coarse language in front of his sister, which meant he was on the ragged edge, barely aware of what he said or did. Dare looked away from them, understanding the lack of control.<br><br>He focused on the rented van. "I had to go through several lookouts and a few armed guards to get her out of there."<br><br>"Quietly." Trace made it a statement, not a question.<br><br>"There wasn't much fuss." Dare always worked in efficient silence; an alarm would have brought more armed guards, possibly too many for him to combat. As much as he wanted to kill them all, he hadn't.<br><br>Only those most responsible.<br><br>By the time the empty trailer was discovered, Dare was already heading over the border into San Diego&#x2014;where Trace waited. Over the years he'd built up alliances<br><br>everywhere, and sometimes worked with the coyotes who made a living taking people back and forth over the border.<br><br>Thanks to those contacts, even with the extra cargo slumped in his backseat, no one had stopped him as he went through the border checkpoint. The van had been given only a cursory inspection, his weapons ignored, and the excuse of the women being tired&#x2014;never mind that one was beaten and haggard, only half-dressed&#x2014;had satisfied all questions.<br><br>Both men were damn good at what they did. But Trace couldn't go after his sister himself as he'd wanted, because the men holding her knew what he looked like. Before he'd have even gotten close to Tijuana, Trace would have been spotted by lookouts.<br><br>So Dare had gone&#x2014;and come back with more than he'd bargained for.<br><br>Making a small sound, Alani tucked her face in closer to her brother's shoulder. The siblings shared blond hair and light brown eyes, but that's where the physical similarities ended. Trace was thirty, of an age with Dare, eight years older than his sister. He stood six foot three and weighed over two hundred pounds&#x2014;all of it muscle.<br><br>Next to him, Alani looked tiny and fragile and, presently, wounded. Even since Dare had removed her from the trailer, fresh bruises continued to show on her arms and around her narrow wrists. Because the bastards had planned to sell her, they hadn't harmed her face.<br><br>Innocence was a huge commodity, and at twenty-two, having led a sheltered life, Alani gave off a definite vibe of innocence. Blond-haired, blue-eyed women brought the most profit, but he had a feeling that Alani's golden-brown eyes, in contrast to her very fair hair, would have fascinated the sick pricks.<br><br>Dare prayed they hadn't raped her, knowing a woman ill-used would bring less, but he left that uncomfortable discussion for Trace.<br><br>Hearing a noise like a soft moan, Dare zeroed in on the van with his senses on alert. He'd left the rear door open so he'd hear her if she moved, if she awoke.... But she did no more than readjust.<br><br>Three hours had passed since he'd carried her out of that trailer. Worry gnawed at him.<br><br>Why didn't she awaken?<br><br>"Dare?" His eyes filled with pain, rage and relief, Trace whispered, "Thank you."<br><br>Alani gave an audible swallow, and then she, too, said, "Yes, thank you. So much."<br><br>Putting a hand on her shoulder, Dare replied without words. He'd known Alani for years, watched her grow up, and felt like a pseudo big brother in many ways. He'd attended her graduation, both from high school and college. He'd been there with Alani and Trace when they buried their parents.<br><br>They had become part of his hodgepodge family.<br><br>Two days ago human traffickers had snatched Alani outside her hotel while she vacationed near the beach. Tomorrow she would have been sold, and finding her after that might have become impossible.<br><br>Right now, what the siblings needed was time alone, and Dare needed to sort things out with his remaining passenger. "I should get going."<br><br>Trace followed Dare's attention toward the van, saw the slim, dirty foot that appeared out of the open rear-passenger door, and lifted one eyebrow in an expression of disbelief. "You have a passenger?"<br><br>"A small complication, that's all."<br><br>"You're serious?"<br><br>Dare shrugged. "There were six women in that small trailer, Trace. Four of them were local and scattered as soon as I got them free." He nodded his head toward the van. "That one was drugged, near starved, grimy." And in many ways, even in the cramped confines of the rusty trailer, she'd been separated from the others, kept alone.<br><br>For certain, she wasn't the typical woman kidnapped for the growing sex trade.<br><br>Trace grew curious in that quiet way of his. "An American.complication?"<br><br>"I think so." From what he'd seen of her grubby face, she didn't look foreign. "She hasn't come to yet, so I haven't been able to talk to her."<br><br>Alani turned in her brother's arms, and she, too, looked toward the van. "She fought them whenever she came to. She called them names and almost...egged them on." Alani shivered in remembered fear. "It was so horrible. The men slapped her around for being mouthy, but she didn't stop. She just cursed them more."<br><br>Dare frowned. The little idiot might have been killed. "Foolhardy."<br><br>"I think she was really...angry." As if she couldn't fathom such boldness, Alani took a breath. "Even when they held her down to force more drugs on her, she didn't cry. She.raged."<br><br>"Did she speak English?"<br><br>Nodding, Alani said, "She sounded American to me. I mean, no accent or anything."<br><br>Considering all that, Dare said aloud, "She wasn't there for the same purpose as the rest of you."<br><br>"Probably not. Sometimes four or five of them would come in the trailer, but they'd stand around her and I couldn't see what they did. As far as I could tell, they<br><br>never really leered at her like..." She bit her lip, shivered again. "Like they did the rest of us. They never seemed to be sizing her up for anything. They just picked on her."<br><br>Trace hugged her again. "It's all right. You're safe now."<br><br>She nodded, shored up by the courage her brother had given her, and faced Dare. "She was there when we got there, already looking pretty bad. Once, before the men drugged her, she told me her name was Molly."<br><br>"Molly what?"<br><br>Alani shook her head. "We weren't supposed to talk, so I was afraid to ask her anything."<br><br>Trace tucked her back in close and asked over her head, "What are you going to do with her now?"<br><br>"No idea." Dare thought of her insubstantial weight when she'd been over his shoulder, of that tangled, light brown hair that had concealed much of her bruised face. "Hopefully someone will pay me for bringing her home."<br><br>Without releasing her brother, Alani reached out and punched Dare for the callous comment. He grinned, caught her wrist and kissed her knuckles.<br><br>She'd been given a terrible fright, and two days had probably felt like a month, but Alani had spirit. She'd get through this, thank God.<br><br>But the other one. How long had they had her? And why? Impatient with thoughts of her, Dare said, "I gotta run."<br><br>"Hold up a sec." Trace caught his arm, then dug in his jeans pocket and pulled out a fat envelope.<br><br>Pissed, Dare took a step back. "What the hell is that?"<br><br>"Expenses. And don't curse in front of Alani." Hell, just because he usually hired out didn't mean he'd<br><br>charge a friend&#x2014;a brother. He'd have gone after Alani if he'd had to crawl the whole way. "I don't need it."<br><br>Solemn, Trace held the envelope out to him. "But I need you to take it."<br><br>It hit Dare anew how difficult this was for Trace, not just that his sister had been hurt, but that he hadn't been able to go after her himself.<br><br>Dare took the envelope. "Thanks." He leaned in close. "And for future reference, I resolved the issue of you being recognized." There was no one left who knew Trace.<br><br>Deep satisfaction glittered in Trace's eyes. He gave a sharp nod. "I should have doubled the amount."<br><br>"No." Dare's smile wasn't friendly. "That was all my pleasure."<br><br>With no further discussion of money, Trace and Alani said their goodbyes and left the lot in Trace's silver Jag. They'd stay in an upscale hotel for the night and fly home tomorrow. Until then, Trace would keep his sister under very close guard.<br><br>Dare stood there, watching them until the purr of the engine faded and their taillights could no longer be seen. Moon shadows surrounded him. Night creatures gave a gentle call.<br><br>The peaceful ambiance didn't deceive him.<br><br>Hands on his hips, he looked again toward the van.<br><br>Now what?<br><br>The hospital, with all those questions and a lack of answers?<br><br>A hotel room? That would be his preference, but not with a woman on the brink of death.<br><br><em>If </em>she was on the brink of death. Drugs could be a real complication, giving false symptoms and concealing a true state of health. It was possible that if she'd just come to, she'd be okay.<br><br>But maybe not.<br><br>Dare needed her to drink, to eat. And it wouldn't hurt to get the bugs out of her hair.<br><br>Before he even realized it, he strode that way, anxious to look in on her again.<br><br>One hand on the top of the open door, the other on the side of the car, Dare leaned in&#x2014;and found her awake. Enormous, bruised eyes dominated her face.<br><br>Before he could register that she'd come around, he got a very dirty foot to the face. Hard.<br><br>He jerked back. "Son of a&#x2014;"<br><br>The attack took him by surprise, and even with her meager strength, a heel to the nose hurt like hell. But he didn't want to compound things by overreacting. She'd recovered with a vengeance and most probably a lot of confusion. Though blood trickled from his nose, Dare wasn't disabled in any way.<br><br>With no help for it, he leaned into the backseat and, after a very brief struggle, pinned her down with her arms over her head, her legs caught under his.<br><br>Those large, slightly unfocused eyes glared at him. They were dark brown, like rich chocolate, and at the moment filled with a wealth of fear and rage.<br><br>She didn't scream, thank God, just breathed hard and fast and strained against him.<br><br>"You're safe now," Dare told her while trying to control her in a way that wouldn't allow her to hurt herself. "You're in San Diego, not Mexico."<br><br>She blinked fast, giving away her nervousness.<br><br>Dare sought the right words to reassure her. "I was there to retrieve a friend, one of the girls trapped in the trailer with you. And there you were, too, so..." Lacking a sound business argument for his decision, Dare rolled one shoulder. "So I took you."<br><br>She stilled a little, wary, uncertain. Hopeful.<br><br>"Your options now are the hospital, hotel or police. Take your pick."<br><br>Seconds ticked by. A drop of blood from his nose landed on her chest to mingle with dark bruises, numerous scratches and dirt. She didn't flinch, and short of releasing her, there wasn't much Dare could do about his bleeding nose.<br><br>Lifting her head, she looked beyond him, but it was dark, too dark to see and recognize the dubious safety of an American parking lot.<br><br>Then, just as suddenly as she'd attacked, she went limp, her head falling back, her muscles weak. Either from her recent exertion or continued terror, Dare felt a fine trembling in her slim body.<br><br>Voice quaking, she whispered, "Hotel, please."<br><br>Unexpected.<br><br>But appreciated. "Wise choice." He waited for theatrics, for that scream that didn't come. Cautious, Dare eyed her. "I can let you go without more violence?"<br><br>She gave one jerky nod.<br><br>Slowly, he sat up and levered himself out of the van. She didn't move. She didn't look capable of moving.<br><br>Stripping off his shirt, he used it to clean the blood from his busted nose.<br><br>What to do now? If he went to the front desk to register them, would she try to skip out on him? Dare could see that she wasn't yet herself, didn't have much left of strength or composure. If panic sent her running, she wouldn't get far, and could end up right back in trouble again.<br><br>But he couldn't very well traipse her into the motel with him.<br><br>For one thing.she reeked.<br><br>Not that he held that against her. Thanks to the conditions he'd found her in, personal cleanliness would have been impossible. But to add to that, the space they'd provided her hadn't been much better than a dump. He'd seen rat holes near the moldy mattress they'd supplied her, as well as a variety of bugs crawling around.<br><br>For another, she wore only a long T-shirt that didn't quite reach her very dirty, scuffed knees, with another oversized man's button-up shirt over it. The clothes dwarfed her small body, looking absurd. Mud and more caked her bare feet. Her brown hair looked like it had been through a blender.<br><br>While he tried to sort out his next move, she slowly sat upright, holding tightly to the back of the seat for balance. She swallowed convulsively. "Do you have anything to drink?"<br><br></p><h2>Beauty Pop, Vol. 5 (5)</h2><p>Narumi&#39;s father, Yujiro, a world famous hairstylist with salons across the globe, has never been able to defeat Kiri&#39;s father Seiji in a hairstyling competition.

The authors cover a variety of areas, putting Jesus as a person in his historical context and his teachings in their religious context.

It was only later writers, from Paul onwards that distorted his teachings and inserted anti-Jewish sentiments and interpretations into his teachings. Jesus can be understood as a rabbi engaging in the Jewish tradition of self-critical exploration to improve the Temple. Many other rabbis in the centuries before and after did the same thing, and during Jesus&#x2019;s lifetime were in the process of changing Judaism from being Temple based to being synagogue based. Jesus was a part of that development and must be understood in that context.<br> Especially useful was the authors&#x2019; use of comparable texts from Christian and Jewish texts. I also found interesting the explanations of certain words especially when multiple meanings are present in the original word but a single specific word is used in translation. That may be because I&#x2019;m a philophile (I love words).<br> This is a useful book for Jews, Christians and everyone else interested in interfaith understanding, and should reduce the sum total of ignorance in the world just a little bit. <b>&#x2014;Rosemarie Cawkwell</b><br><br><br>In&nbsp;<i>Jesus: First Century Rabbi,&nbsp;</i>twenty-first century Rabbi David Zaslow makes a thoughtful and challenging contribution to Jewish-Christian dialogue. Not just another book about the Jewishness of Jesus (although it is that); Zaslow gently but insistently points out both convergences between faiths, and remaining areas of discomfort (such as Christians describing the Law being "fulfilled" or as a "prefiguration"). An honest book, but a profoundly hopeful one. <b>&#x2014;Raymond Edwards, </b><i><b>The Tablet</b></i><b>, December 2015</b><br><br>This one is a bit more scholarly, but I&#x2019;m fascinated with the fact that Jesus was Jewish. As mad at they made him at the Temple or the local synagogue, he never abandoned his faith. This book is written by an extremely learned Jewish Rabbi, who makes the argument that we all have a great deal to learn from Jesus. He wants to show readers Jesus in his historical context; including changes that were taking place in the Jewish ways of worship at that time. He also quotes a number of Jewish teachers who were teaching similar things as Jesus in his day. Much food for thought and I appreciated the author&#x2019;s open-minded approach. <b>&#x2014;Traci Rhoades</b></p><h2>Rabbits for Food</h2><p><b>Master of razor-edged literary humor Binnie Kirshenbaum returns with her first novel in a decade, a devastating, laugh-out-loud funny story of a writer&#x2019;s slide into depression and institutionalization.</b><br> &nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s Eve, the holiday of forced fellowship, mandatory fun, and paper hats. While dining out with her husband and their friends, Kirshenbaum&#x2019;s protagonist&#x2014;an acerbic, mordantly witty, and clinically depressed writer&#x2014;fully unravels. Her breakdown lands her in the psych ward of a prestigious New York hospital, where she refuses all modes of recommended treatment. Instead, she passes the time chronicling the lives of her fellow &#x201c;lunatics&#x201d; and writing a novel about what brought her there. Her story is a brilliant and brutally funny dive into the disordered mind of a woman who sees the world all too clearly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Propelled by razor-sharp comic timing and rife with pinpoint insights, Kirshenbaum examines what it means to be unloved and loved, to succeed and fail, to be at once impervious and raw.<i> Rabbits for Food </i>shows how art can lead us out of&#x2014;or into&#x2014;the depths of disconsolate loneliness and piercing grief.

I&#x2019;m expecting this dog to be a beagle, a beagle dressed in an orange dayglow vest the same as the orange dayglow vests worn by suitcase-sniffing beagles at the airport. To expect that the do-gooder dog will be the same breed of dog wearing the same outfit worn by narco-dogs no doubt reveals the limitations of my imagination.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the opposite wall from where I sit is the Schedule of Activities board. The board is white, and the Activities are written in black marker across a seven-day grid. Seven days, just in case I want to plan ahead, map out my week. Next to the board is the clock, one of those schoolroom-type clocks, which moves time as if through sludge. That&#x2019;s it. There&#x2019;s nothing else to look at other than the blue slipper-socks on my feet. Shoes with laces are Not Allowed. Other shoes Not Allowed are shoes with high heels or even kitten heels, as if a kitten heel could do damage, which is why I&#x2019;m wearing the blue slipper-socks. Slipper-socks with rubber chevrons on the soles. Chevrons are V-shaped, but the V is upside-down. The slipper-socks also come in dung-colored brown.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A partial list of other things Not Allowed includes: pencils, nail clippers, laptops, cell phones, vitamins, mouthwash, and mascara.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn&#x2019;t take long to grow bored by my slipper-socks, and I turn my attention back to the clock. The second hand stutters, ffffffifty-one, ffffffifty-two. A watched pot never boils. My mother used to say that, that a watched pot never boils. Also, every cloud has a silver lining, tomorrow is another day, and time heals all wounds. Words of comfort that invariably resulted in a spontaneous combustion of spastic adolescent rage. One of the nurses, the tall one, tall and skinny, gangly not graceful&#x2014;Ella, her name is Ella&#x2014;walks by, and then as if she&#x2019;d forgotten something, she pauses, pivots and retraces her steps. &#x201c;Mind if I join you?&#x201d; she asks. To sit on the bench, Ella has to fold herself as if her arms and legs were laundry.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In stark contrast to the rest of her, Ella&#x2019;s head is round like a ball; bigger than a baseball and smaller than a basketball, but that&#x2019;s the shape. Exactly like a ball. She&#x2019;s like a stick figure come to life, having stepped out from that ubiquitous Crayola crayon-on-paper drawing, the one with the three stick figures and a tree and a square house with a triangular roof set like a hat at a jaunty angle. From the upper left-hand corner, a giant yellow sun warms this lopsided two-dimensional world. No doubt it&#x2019;s some standard developmental thing, that most children draw the same crap picture at the same crap-picture stage of life. Except for the prodigies and the children who are already fucked up. With the fucked-up ones you get a different picture, something along the same lines, but with the house on fire or the stick figures missing their heads. The prodigy, as young as the age of four, will draw a split-level house with gray shingles, and in the foreground, beneath a maple tree in autumn, a dog frolics in a pile of leaves. I know this for a fact because my sister, the older one, Nicole, was a prodigy in art although later she did not live up to her potential, assuming there was potential and her talent was not one of those things kids simply outgrow, the way my younger sister, the third of us three girls, was born with allergies to milk and wool among other things, which she outgrew at puberty.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ella and I sit here on the bench as if the two of us are in this together, as if we are both waiting for the dog, but then Ella says, &#x201c;You know what, hon? I don&#x2019;t think the dog is coming today.&#x201d; Ella calls everyone &#x201c;hon.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not special, which is one of the things that about kills me from the hurt of it, that I&#x2019;m not special.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And worse than the hurt of not being someone special is the shame of it, the shame of how much I want that, to be someone special.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog is supposed to be here. It says so on the Activities Board. Mondays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to noon: Pet Therapy (Dog).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t come on Monday, either,&#x201d; I say, and the sorrow I experience about the dog not showing up is way out of proportion to the fact of it, but that is why I&#x2019;m here, isn&#x2019;t it? Because the sorrow I feel about everything is bigger than the thing itself?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At home, Albie and I have a cat who is almost, but not quite, two years old. A rescue. Literally. A man found him in a brown paper bag in a trash can on Third Avenue and Sixty-First Street. A kitten tossed into the garbage as if a kitten were a banana peel. We named him Jeffrey, and on his first day in his new home, he trailed after me the way a duckling follows its mother, or the way a puppy would&#x2019;ve trotted at my heels. &#x201c;I know he looks like a cat,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but I think he might be a dog.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following morning after Albie left for work, I got out of bed, as it was my habit to start my day alone. Here, now, in this place, there is no such thing as alone, which would drive me out of my mind, if I weren&#x2019;t already out of my mind. Jeffrey raced to follow me to the kitchen where I put fresh food in his dish and clean water in his bowl. Down on one knee alongside him, I gave him a scratch behind the ears and kissed him on the top of his soft little head before getting up to take a shower.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only after I&#x2019;d rinsed the shampoo from my hair, when I opened my eyes, that I found Jeffrey there, at my feet, in the shower, looking up at me as if mildly confused: Why we are getting ourselves wet, on purpose? I scooped him up into my arms and turned away from the shower spray to cuddle him, to shelter him from the storm raging at my back. In the telling and re-telling of this episode, I would leave out the last part and let the story be about nothing other than a goofy kitten&#x2019;s extreme cuteness.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ella suggests that we give up on the dog for now, that I join some other Activity. &#x201c;So, what do you think, hon? How about Arts and Crafts?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Monday when the dog didn&#x2019;t show up, I went to Arts and Crafts.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activities are not exactly mandatory but, as Dr. Fitzgerald made clear from the get-go, the road to mental health is paved with Activities such as Painting with Watercolors, Board Games, Origami, Spirituality, Yoga, or even worse&#x2014;Sing-along, for example.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Positive interaction within a group is a strong indication of mental health.&#x201d; Dr. Fitzgerald could not stress enough the importance of social engagement with the other lunatics.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at my mental-healthy best, I&#x2019;m not one for activities. Positive interaction within a group has never been much part of my social experience. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just now,&#x201d; I tried to explain. &#x201c;Please,&#x201d; I said. Please, the please subverted an assertion into a request, as if I were asking a favor, as if I were begging.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not want to go to Arts and Crafts again. The Arts and Crafts therapist clearly believes that a troubled mind is a simple mind, that to be clinically depressed is the same thing as to be a congenital idiot. In Arts and Crafts on Monday, we glued mosaic tiles to a square piece of wood to make the exact same whatever-the-fuck-it-was that I made in arts and crafts class in the third grade. Even in the third grade, I knew that this was something only a demented person would want, and sure enough, the obese loon sitting next to me asked if she could have mine. That night after dinner, when Albie came to visit, I told him, &#x201c;I made something for you in Arts and Crafts, but one of the crazy people stole it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if perhaps there is something she&#x2019;s overlooked, Ella concentrates on the Activities Board. She has overlooked nothing. She knows what choices remain: Creative Writing or Jigsaw Puzzles.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Granted, I am clinically depressed but I&#x2019;m not that depressed, so low as to go with Jigsaw Puzzles, and Creative Writing&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve got to be kidding me.</p><h2>Death Undercover: Bruno, Chief of Police 7</h2><p>PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED AS CHILDREN OF WAR Bruno, chief of police, is under pressure.

It teaches that the living must, first and foremost, understand the process that the soul goes through before they can help the spirit in its transition. Dion Fortune&#39;s Book of the Dead is a clear, concise, illuminating guide that explains the stages in the natural process of dying that each and every soul passes through from this world to the next. Fortune shows how traditional customs connected with the passing of a soul have their roots in psychic fact. For example, we place candles and fresh flowers in the death chamber as soon as the soul has departed because they provide sufficient etheric emanations to meet the needs of the &#34;etheric double,&#34; assisting in the soul&#39;s disentanglement from the physical. Without the flowers and candles, the etheric body will draw its vitality from any available source, including grievers. Loved ones in particular are susceptible to depletion and can be drained dry in their ignorance. The living, Fortune writes, have two tasks to perform: &#34;We must see to it that dust returns as swiftly and harmoniously as possible, giving rise to none of the happenings which may be termed the pathologies of death,&#34; and &#34;we ought to follow up the departing soul with the right kind of telepathic communication until it is safely established on the Other Side.&#34;</p><p><p>Dion Fortune (1891-1946), founder of The Society of Inner Light, is recognized as one of the most luminous and significant figures of the 20th-century esoteric thought.

A large quilt gallery will inspire you to design your own Sashiko/applique creations.</p><p>I live in Hawaii, surrounded by exuberant tropical flowers and an azure blue ocean. Inspiration abounds right out the door of my studio, where our garden overflows with bananas, plumeria, giant heliconia, and a host of native and exotic plants. I&#39;ve been a gardener most of my life, and quilting is an extension of my passion for plants. I am compelled to make quilts that reflect the beauty and diversity of the Islands. In keeping with the polyglot culture of Hawaii, I like to mix up quilt traditions--a Tahitian curved border, a Japanese wave design, and the symmetry of Hawaiian quilts. I was introduced to Japanese design, Sashiko, and the fine art of quiltmaking by my mother, Kitty Pippen, who has been my inspiration and mentor all my life. I love to teach and introduce Sashiko to students of all ages. When I lived on the west side of Kauai, I taught weekly classes at Nana&#39;s House, where students from the age of 8 to 80 gathered to create their own Sashiko designs. Breaking from Japanese Sashiko tradition, they wanted to work in lots of color and use designs that reflected life in Hawaii, such as hukilaus of tropical fish caught up in a Sashiko net, or fragrant butter-yellow plumeria. From my wonderful students, I learned how to work with diverse ages, abilities, and the true meaning of aloha. I encourage you to use Sashiko not only as a teaching tool but also for your own artistic expression. As you can see, Sashiko can be adapted to any design. And remember, it isn&#39;t how perfect your stitches are but how much you enjoy the journey along the way.Hand-stitch 6 vivid quilts inspired by tropical flora and fauna Learn the secrets of successful Sashiko and appliqu� Options for both turn-under and fusible appliqu� Create designs from your own photos Embellish your quilts with hand embroidery</p><h2>Selected Stories (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)</h2><p><b>Eighty short stories by a master of the genre </b><br><br>O.

Henry. His talent for vivid caricature, local tone, narrative agility, and compassion tempered by irony made him a vastly popular writer in the last decade of his life. He was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, to ordinary middle-class parents and worked in an uncle&#x2019;s drugstore as a youth, becoming a certified pharmacist. Like many Southerners after the Civil War, he sought his fortune in the West, holding various jobs (newspaper work, clerking in a land office, a teller at an Austin bank). Charged with embezzlement in 1894, he fled to Honduras, returning in 1897 to be with his ill and dying wife. His conviction was caused more by his eluding trial than by the conflicting evidence of theft. In the Ohio State Penitentiary (1898-1901), he began to write the stories that made him famous. He moved to New York, remarried, and kept his identity a secret from all but a few friends. He is buried in Asheville, North Carolina.

Privately he doubted more than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of total strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure which he was supposed to be undergoing.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I know how it will be,&#x2019; his sister had said when he was preparing to migrate to this rural retreat; &#x2018;you will bury yourself down there and not speak to a living soul, and your nerves will be worse than ever from moping. I shall just give you letters of introduction to all the people I know there. Some of them, as far as I can remember, were quite nice.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Framton wondered whether Mrs Sappleton, the lady to whom he was presenting one of the letters of introduction, came into the nice division.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Do you know many of the people round here?&#x2019; asked the niece, when she judged that they had had sufficient silent communion.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Hardly a soul,&#x2019; said Framton. &#x2018;My sister was staying here, at the rectory, you know, some four years ago, and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the people here.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>He made the last statement in a tone of distinct regret. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Then you know practically nothing about my aunt?&#x2019; pursued the self-possessed young lady. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Only her name and address,&#x2019; admitted the caller. He was wondering whether Mrs Sappleton was in the married or widowed state. An undefinable something about the room seemed to suggest masculine habitation. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Her great tragedy happened just three years ago,&#x2019; said the child; &#x2018;that would be since your sister&#x2019;s time.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Her tragedy?&#x2019; asked Framton; somehow in this restful country spot tragedies seemed out of place.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an October afternoon,&#x2019; said the niece, indicating a large French window that opened on to a lawn.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;It is quite warm for the time of the year,&#x2019; said Framton; &#x2018;but has that window got anything to do with the tragedy?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Out through that window, three years ago to a day, her husband and her two young brothers went off for their day&#x2019;s shooting. They never came back. In crossing the moor to their favourite snipe-shooting ground they were all three engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog. It had been that dreadful wet summer, you know, and places that were safe in other years gave way suddenly without warning. Their bodies were never recovered. That was the dreadful part of it.&#x2019; Here the child&#x2019;s voice lost its self-possessed note and became falteringly human. &#x2018;Poor aunt always thinks that they will come back some day, they and the little brown spaniel that was lost with them, and walk in at that window just as they used to do. That is why the window is kept open every evening till it is quite dusk. Poor dear aunt, she has often told me how they went out, her husband with his white waterproof coat over his arm, and Ronnie, her youngest brother, singing, &#x2018;Berrie, why do you bound?&#x2019; as he always did to tease her, because she said it got on her nerves. Do you know, sometimes on still, quiet evenings like this, I almost get a creepy feeling that they will all walk in through that window &#x2013;&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>She broke off with a little shudder. It was a relief to Framton when the aunt bustled into the room with a whirl of apologies for being late in making her appearance.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I hope Vera has been amusing you?&#x2019; she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;She has been very interesting,&#x2019; said Framton.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I hope you don&#x2019;t mind the open window,&#x2019; said Mrs Sappleton briskly; &#x2018;my husband and brothers will be home directly from shooting, and they always come in this way. They&#x2019;ve been out for snipe in the marshes today, so they&#x2019;ll make a fine mess over my poor carpets. So like you menfolk, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>She rattled on cheerfully about the shooting and the scarcity of birds, and the prospects for duck in the winter. To Framton, it was all purely horrible. He made a desperate but only partially successful effort to turn the talk on to a less ghastly topic; he was conscious that his hostess was giving him only a fragment of her attention, and her eyes were constantly straying past him to the open window and the lawn beyond. It was certainly an unfortunate coincidence that he should have paid his visit on this tragic anniversary.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest, an absence of mental excitement, and avoidance of anything in the nature of violent physical exercise,&#x2019; announced Framton, who laboured under the tolerably wide-spread delusion that total strangers and chance acquaintances are hungry for the least detail of one&#x2019;s ailments and infirmities, their cause and cure. &#x2018;On the matter of diet they are not so much in agreement,&#x2019; he continued.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;No?&#x2019; said Mrs Sappleton, in a voice which only replaced a yawn at the last moment. Then she suddenly brightened into alert attention &#x2013; but not to what Framton was saying.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Here they are at last!&#x2019; she cried. &#x2018;Just in time for tea, and don&#x2019;t they look as if they were muddy up to the eyes!&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Framton shivered slightly and turned towards the niece with a look intended to convey sympathetic comprehension. The child was staring out through the open window with dazed horror in her eyes. In a chill shock of nameless fear Framton swung round in his seat and looked in the same direction.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the deepening twilight three figures were walking across the lawn towards the window; they all carried guns under their arms, and one of them was additionally burdened with a white coat hung over his shoulders. A tired brown spaniel kept close at their heels. Noiselessly they neared the house, and then a hoarse young voice chanted out of the dusk: &#x2018;&#x2018;I said, Bertie, why do you bound?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Framton grabbed wildly at his stick and hat; the halldoor, the gravel-drive, and the front gate were dimly noted stages in his headlong retreat. A cyclist coming along the road had to run into the hedge to avoid imminent collision.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Here we are, my dear,&#x2019; said the bearer of the white mackintosh, coming in through the window; &#x2018;fairly muddy, but most of it&#x2019;s dry. Who was that who bolted out as we came up?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;A most extraordinary man, a Mr Nuttel,&#x2019; said Mrs Sappleton; &#x2018;could only talk about his illnesses, and dashed off without a word of good-bye or apology when you arrived.

Craig Chapman delves deep into the personal recollections and mental state of Bill Chapman as he fought against the Nazis, enduring frontline combat and witnessing horror on a massive scale. Lieutenant Chapman maintains his sanity by isolating his emotions from the chaos of the battlefield, and the young officer turns into a hard-edged warrior who dispassionately orders men to risk their lives yet still manages to hold onto his humanity.</p><p>Craig S. Chapman draws on his experience as an infantry officer and his skill as a researcher to narrate past military actions in a way that sheds new light on the challenges, triumphs, and miscalculations of armed conflicts. He is the author of More Terrible Than Victory: North Carolina&#39;s Bloody Bethel Regiment, 1861-65.&#34;I spent 15 months in the European Theater of Operations and participated in all the campaigns that Craig depicted.

It&#39;s not long before Percy Jackson, half-god son of Poseidon and a mortal mom, learns of his fourth mission: searching the Labyrinth for a way to stop Kronos&#39;s plan to unite the evil forces of the underworld. Jesse Bernstein is on target whether he&#39;s narrating blow-by-blow accounts of Percy&#39;s sword fights or inventing cameos for various other characters: Hephaestus, who repairs a Toyota; an aged Daedalus; and Grover, Percy&#39;s slow-witted sidekick.

John Folsom woke up one morning to the sound of a small, scruffy donkey tied up outside his quarters. He was charmed by this scrawny animal with a plaintive expression. Folsom and his fellow Marines took in the donkey, built him a corral and shelter, and escorted him on daily walks. One night, hanging out with the Marines as they relaxed after work, the donkey snatched someone&#x2019;s lit cigarette and gobbled it up, to the laughter of all. Suddenly, the donkey had a name: Smoke. More than a conversation topic for troops connecting with families back home, Smoke served as mascot, ambassador, and battle buddy.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Smoke the Donkey</i> recounts the strong friendship between Colonel Folsom and this stray donkey and the massive challenges of reuniting Smoke with Folsom in the United States following Folsom&#x2019;s retirement. After being given to a local sheik, Smoke wandered the desert before Folsom rallied an international team to take him on a convoluted journey to his new home. The team won a protracted bureaucratic battle to move Smoke from Iraq to Turkey, only to face a tougher fight getting him out of Turkey. Once in the States, Smoke became a beloved therapy animal for both children and veterans. Smoke&#x2019;s story, while tinged with sadness, speaks to the enduring bond between a man and an animal, unbroken by war, distance, or red tape.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Cate Folsom</b>, the wife of Colonel Folsom, is a longtime editor for the <i>Omaha World-Herald</i>.

The same drama of obscurity and nuance that attended the discovery of Emily Dickinson and Wallace Stevens is suggested by the career of Robert Lax. An expatriate American whose work to date &#x2014; more than forty books &#x2014; has been published mostly in Europe, this 85-year-old poet built a following in the U.S. among figures as widespread as Mark Van Doren, e. e. cummings, Jack Kerouac, and Sun Ra. The works in Love Had a Compass represent every stage of Lax's development as a poet, from his early years in the 1940s as a staff writer for The New Yorker to his present life on the Greek Island of Patmos. An inveterate wanderer, Lax's own sense of himself as both exile and pilgrim is carefully evoked in his prose journals and informs the pages of the Marseille Diaries, published here for the first time. Together with the poems, they provide the best portrait available to date of one of the most striking and original poets of our age.</p><p>ROBERT LAX was born in Olean, New York, in 1915. He studied at Columbia University in the 1930s, where John Berryman, Ad Reinhardt, and Thomas Merton were among his contemporaries, and later worked for the New Yorker and Time before helping to found Jubilee magazine in 1953. After traveling for extended periods in Italy and France in the 1950s, he settled in Greece in 1962, first on the island of Kalymnos, then later on the island of Patmos. He died in 2000.&#x201c;Among America&#x2019;s greatest poets, a true minimalist who can weave awesome poems from remarkably few words.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Richard Kostelanetz, New York Times Book Review<br><br></b><br><br>&#x201c;Lax's early poems are a mix of emotionality...and formal experimentation...But his finest work can be seen in the previously unpublished sequence of poems, <i>Port City: The Marseille Diaries.</i>&#x201d;<b><i> &#x2015;Publishers Weekly</i></b><br>&#x201c;Lax dispenses with metaphor and largely with ego . . . to present what he sees with elemental forcefulness, as if in strong Mediterranean sunlight . . . individual poems register as prayers and, more often, mystical visions.&#x201d;<b><i> &#x2015;Booklist</i></b></p><h2>A Better Man (Thorndike Press Large Print: Chief Inspector Gamache)</h2><p><p>A Better Man, ' with its mix of meteorological suspense, psychological insight and criminal pursuit, is arguably the best book yet in an outstanding, original oeuvre.

Some hear the echoes of Native Americans or the first settlers. Some feel the great age of the trees and revere them, while others feel they are in the presence of an overwhelmingly rare beauty. Still others understand the profound scientific value of old-growth forests as reference systems for what forests can be. Despite the remarkable emotional appeal and scientific value of old-growth forests, they are rare in Wisconsin. Only 0.3% of Wisconsin s old-growth forests remain, but these scattered, small parcels still retain their ability to amaze hikers with their size, beauty, and elegance. Where are they? This book directs visitors to the 50 best old-growth sites left in Wisconsin. Each site has clear directions, a listing of ownership, size, and age, and a description of its ecological features, with perhaps a story of why it was saved. A map and photo(s) illustrates each site. An additional shorter chapter includes the 50 Best-of-the-Rest. The book is for a general audience, but its wealth of rigorously-researched and profusely-illustrated data may also serve as a general reference for professional ecologists and conservationists.</p><p>John Bates is the author of nine books and a contributor to seven others, all of which focus on the natural history of the Northwoods. He s worked as a naturalist in Wisconsin s Northwoods for 28 years, leading an array of trips all designed to help people further understand the remarkable diversity and beauty of nature, and our place within it. John won the 2006 Ellis/Henderson Outdoor Writing Award from the Council for Wisconsin Writers for his book Graced by the Seasons: Spring and Summer in the Northwoods.Ancient forests are a topic of perpetual fascination for many of us, but amateurs and professionals alike frequently misunderstand these most senior of our woodlands. Enter naturalist John Bates. His extraordinarily detailed descriptions of Wisconsin s old-growth forests lift the veil of mystery and provide us with glimpses of what the Badger State s extensive pre-settlement forests were like. The book is a veritable goldmine of information on the sad destruction of Wisconsin s original woodlands. Attitudes toward old growth, then and now, are explored along with an authoritative account of the biological and genetic diversity at risk when nature s true woodlands are compromised. These accounts are followed by an extensive inventory of today s old-growth remnants. There is simply no better book written on these topics for a wide audience than Our Living Ancestor The History and Ecology of Old-Growth Forests in Wisconsin (and Where to Find Them). No serious amateur or professional can be without it. --Robert T. Leverett, Cofounder, The Native Tree Society; Coauthor, The Sierra Club Guide to Ancient Forests of the Northeast<br><br>This book is an ideal resource for anyone who wants to understand Wisconsin s forests. It is extremely well researched, clearly presented, and masterfully written. Bates has turned what could be a dry subject into a lively, living, symphony of words. There is something for everyone here, whether you are an office-bound historian or a hiker who wants to experience the last remnants of wild ancient forests. Although every state could use a resource like this, it is one of a kind. I will keep it&nbsp;on my shelf within reach, and I believe that many decades from now people will still be referencing their copies of The History and Ecology of Old-Growth Forests in Wisconsin. John Bates has done us all a great favor by putting this important information together in one perfect package. --Joan Maloof,&nbsp; Founder and Director of the Old-Growth Forest Network, and author of Among the Ancients and Nature s Temples.<br><br>In one way or another we all depend on forests. Our understanding and appreciation of forests is more important today than ever and so is the critical need to restore and maintain old forests.&nbsp;Our Living Ancestors&nbsp;is a remarkable blend of the beauty, history and ecology of Wisconsin s 16 million acres of forest. It is a captivating account of what our great forests were once like, and how they got where they are today. It is a comprehensive and easy read linking human dependence on forests over the centuries and into the future.&nbsp;This book should be required reading for all who depend upon and care about our amazing forests. --Michael Dombeck, PhD, Chief Emeritus, U.S. Forest Service</p><h2>Ed Slott&#39;s Retirement Decisions Guide 2019</h2><p>Ed Slott s powerful educational guide for both consumers and financial advisors demonstrates the step-by-step strategies needed to build and protect a family fortune.

How was this Palestinian charismatic transformed by later generations into the heavenly savior who is the focus of the Christian Church? Did Jesus's own teachings lead to his divine characterization? Or did the church-centered needs of gentile Christianity hide his true face, obscuring the religion he preached and practiced? With unique authority, sensitivity, and insight, renowned scholar <b>Geza Vermes</b> explores these difficult questions by examining the New Testament writings, placing them in the context of the Jewish civilization of the first century. Starting with the elevated, divine figure of Christ presented in the most recent Gospel, the Gospel of John, Vermes travels back through earlier accounts of Jesus's life to reveal the true historical figure.</p><p><i>The Changing Faces of Jesus</i> is a reflection on the ways that translations of Scripture have transformed believers' understandings of Jesus. Author Geza Vermes, a biblical scholar perhaps best known for his English translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls, reviews the varying portraits of Jesus in Scripture, particularly focusing on the letters of Paul and the Gospel of John. The author contends that, "by the end of the first century Christianity had lost sight of the real Jesus and of the original meaning of his message." The real Jesus, a "religious man with an irresistible charismatic charm," was replaced by "Jesus the Christ, the transcendent object of the Christian religion." Vermes avoids the polemic tone often adopted by scholars who make similar arguments. Here is an example of the modest style in which this author makes his momentous claims: <blockquote>As a historian I consider Jesus, the primitive church and the New Testament as part and parcel of first-century Judaism and seek to read them as such rather than through the eyes of a theologian who may often be conditioned, and subconsciously influenced, by two millennia of Christian belief and church directives.</blockquote> This tone will help readers--even those predisposed to disagree with Vermes--to understand his argument that religious belief has skewed understanding of the central figure of the Christian religion. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Geza Vermes&#x2019;s pioneering work on the Dead Sea Scrolls and the historical Jesus led to his appointment as the first professor of Jewish studies at Oxford University, where he is now professor emeritus.

All this and more helps propel Paula Hawkins&#x2019;s addictive debut into a new stratum of the psychological thriller genre. At times, I couldn&#x2019;t help but think: <i>Hitchcockian</i>. From the opening line, the reader knows what they&#x2019;re in for: &#x201c;She&#x2019;s buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks...&#x201d; But Hawkins teases out the mystery with a veteran&#x2019;s finesse. The &#x201c;girl on the train&#x201d; is Rachel, who commutes into London and back each day, rolling past the backyard of a happy-looking couple she names Jess and Jason. Then one day Rachel sees &#x201c;Jess&#x201d; kissing another man. The day after that, Jess goes missing. The story is told from three character&#x2019;s not-to-be-trusted perspectives: Rachel, who mourns the loss of her former life with the help of canned gin and tonics; Megan (aka Jess); and Anna, Rachel&#x2019;s ex-husband&#x2019;s wife, who happens to be Jess/Megan&#x2019;s neighbor. Rachel&#x2019;s voyeuristic yearning for the seemingly idyllic life of Jess and Jason lures her closer and closer to the investigation into Jess/Megan&#x2019;s disappearance, and closer to a deeper understanding of who she really is.

And why, historically, has it occurred in only a few places? Previous efforts to answer these questions have focused on institutions, geography, finances, and psychology. But according to MIT's antidisciplinarian C�sar Hidalgo, understanding the nature of economic growth demands transcending the social sciences&nbsp;and including the natural sciences of information, networks, and complexity. To understand the growth of economies, Hidalgo argues, we first need to understand the growth of order.<br> &nbsp;<br> At first glance, the universe seems hostile to order. Thermodynamics dictates that over time, order--or information--will disappear. Whispers vanish in the wind just like the beauty of swirling cigarette smoke collapses into disorderly clouds. But thermodynamics also has loopholes that promote the growth of information in pockets. Our cities are pockets where information grows, but they are not all the same. For every Silicon Valley, Tokyo, and Paris, there are dozens of places with economies that accomplish little more than pulling rocks off the ground. So, why does the US economy outstrip Brazil's, and Brazil's that of Chad? Why did the technology corridor along Boston's Route 128 languish while Silicon Valley blossomed? In each case, the key is how people, firms, and the networks they form make use of information. <br> &nbsp;<br> Seen from Hidalgo's vantage, economies become distributed computers, made of networks of people, and the problem of economic development becomes the problem of making these computers more powerful. By uncovering the mechanisms that enable the growth of information in nature and society, <i>Why Information Grows</i> lays bear the origins of physical order and economic growth. Situated at the nexus of information theory, physics, sociology, and economics, this book propounds a new theory of how economies can do, not just more, but more interesting things.<br></p><p><b>Cesar Hidalgo</b> leads the Macro Connections group at the MIT Media Lab. He lives in Cambridge Massachusetts with his wife Anna and their daughter Iris.<b>Finalist for the 2015 Hayek Book and Lecture Prize</b><br>"The concept of information is necessary to make sense of anything that is not a boring featureless mass, including life, mind, society, and value. <i>Why Information Grows</i> lucidly explains the foundations of this essential concept, while creatively applying it in exciting new ways. It is filled with interesting ideas, and a pleasure to read."<b>--Steven Pinker, Johnstone Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and author of <i>The Language Instinct</i> and <i>How the Mind Works</i></b><br>"Mr Hidalgo succeeds brilliantly in bringing his complex subject to life. His book is full of nuggets, from memorable phrases to interesting metaphors."<b><i>--Economist</i></b><br>"Written in an accessible and entertaining style.... Hidalgo has made a bold attempt to synthesise a large body of cutting-edge work into a readable, slender volume. This is the future of growth theory and his thought-provoking book deserves to be widely read."<b><i>--Financial Times</i></b><br>"Contains some innovative thinking about what drives growth that could help us to navigate the turbulence of the ever more interconnected global economy."<b><i>--Nature</i></b><br>"Thought-provoking...Well written and accessible, the book is full of interesting ideas that deserve to be read and discussed."<b><i>--CHOICE</i></b><br><br>"An impassioned argument for the advantages of an information-centric view of economic growth, and for understanding the different capacities of nations to provide solutions to human problems... Hidalgo persuasively demonstrates the value of this approach by placing the ideas firmly in their historical context, both in information theory and in physics...

Compiler Gillian Avery's aim was to avoid condescending to children and&nbsp;"to assemble a collection of poems that the owner will not outgrow." With that in mind, she has included very few works that were written solely for a young audience. The more than 250 pieces gathered here&nbsp;range from ballads to epics, from inspired nonsense to memorable reflections on love and death. A wide variety of poets grace these pages, from Mother Goose to Shakespeare, from Emily Dickinson to Noel Coward, from Robert Frost to&nbsp;Ogden Nash. Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" and Rosetti's "Goblin Market" will enchant young readers as much as T. S. Eliot's "The Naming of Cats" and Lewis Carroll's "The Mock-Turtle's Song" will entertain them. Adorned with engravings by the&nbsp;eighteenth-century artist&nbsp;Thomas Bewick, this collection belongs in every family's library.</p><p>The aim has been to assemble a collection of poems that the owner will not outgrow. That is why the Mother Goose rhymes have always been so successful.Gillian Avery (1926- ) was born in Reigate, Surrey, where she started her writing career as a journalist on the <i>Surrey Mirror</i>. Deciding that the pace of book publishing was more congenial than that of newspapers, she went to Oxford in 1950 to work for the Clarendon Press. In 1952 she married a don, Anthony Cockshut, and when they moved to Manchester she was so homesick for Oxford that she set her first novel, <i>The Warden's Niece</i> (1957), in an Oxford college in Victorian times, feeling an affinity between her own pre-war generation and the Victorian child, characterized by a 'meek acceptance of the power of the adult world'. Returning to Oxford in 1964, she continued to write novels, including<i> A Likely Lad</i>, set in Manchester, which won the <i>Guardian</i> award for children's fiction in 1971 and was successfully dramatized as a children's TV serial.<br><br>Gillian Avery is also well known as a reviewer and historian of children's literature. Her two most recent books are <i>Behold the Child: American Children and their Books</i>, <i>1621-1922</i> and <i>The Everyman Anthology of Poetry for Children</i>.</p><h2>Holy Simplicity: The Little Way of Mother Teresa, Dorothy Day &amp; Therese of Lisieux</h2><p>"Embrace the present moment as an ever-flowing source of holiness."<br> &#x2014;Jean Pierre de Caussade, from Chapter Three<br><br> Seeing God in every moment&#x2014;is it possible?

Stevens&#x2019; central theme&#x2015;the worth of the imagination&#x2015;remained with him all his life, and Mrs. Vendler therefore proposes that his development as a poet can best be seen, not in description&#x2015;which must be repetitive&#x2015;of the abstract bases of his work, but rather in a view of his changing styles.</p><p>The author presents here a chronological account of fourteen longer poems that span a thirty-year period, showing, through Stevens&#x2019; experiments in genre, diction, syntax, voice, imagery, and meter, the inventive variety of Stevens&#x2019; work in long forms, and providing at the same time a coherent reading of these difficult poems. She concludes, &#x201c;Stevens was engaged in constant experimentation all his life in an attempt to find the appropriate vehicle for his expansive consciousness; he found it in his later long poems, which surpass in value the rest of his work.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Helen Vendler is A. Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard University.&#x201c;[Vendler's] study of Stevens' longer poems is a difficult, brilliant book that everywhere illuminates not only the specific poems under inspection and Stevens' other work, but our ideas of poetry in general. Her own style, rising to its subject, is capacious and inventive, witty and astringent, intensely dedicated to distinguishing Stevens' finest poems, or moments in poems, from his less fine ones. The result is true criticism, and it comes through most vividly in her discussions of 'Man with the Blue Guitar,' 'Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction,' and 'Auroras of Autumn.' A book to be read and reread, it is absolutely essential for the way it sends us back to the poems it so lovingly and sternly anatomizes.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Vendler] has written a superb and badly needed book giving us readings unlikely to be surpassed of Stevens's longer poems...Mrs. Vendler is a commentator almost clairvoyant...Her book ought to be read, with care and gratitude, by every reader of Stevens, for no critic before her has understood so well his major poems.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Harold Bloom</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This study of Stevens' long poems centers around problems defined by the poetry itself: its style and form, its evolving shape.

Other jewels of Europe&#x2014;sites like Warsaw, Antwerp, and Monte Cassino&#x2014;were, or would soon be, reduced to rubble during attempts to liberate them. But Paris endured, thanks to a fractious cast of characters, from Resistance cells to Free French operatives to an unlikely assortment of diplomats, Allied generals, and governmental officials. Their efforts, and those of the German forces fighting to maintain control of the city, would shape the course of the battle for Europe and color popular memory of the conflict for generations to come.<br><br>In <i>The Blood of Free Men</i>, celebrated historian Michael Neiberg deftly tracks the forces vying for Paris, providing a revealing new look at the city's dramatic and triumphant resistance against the Nazis. The salvation of Paris was not a foregone conclusion, Neiberg shows, and the liberation was a chaotic operation that could have easily ended in the city's ruin. The Allies were intent on bypassing Paris so as to strike the heart of the Third Reich in Germany, and the French themselves were deeply divided; feuding political cells fought for control of the Resistance within Paris, as did Charles de Gaulle and his Free French Forces outside the city. Although many of Paris's citizens initially chose a tenuous stability over outright resistance to the German occupation, they were forced to act when the approaching fighting pushed the city to the brink of starvation. In a desperate bid to save their city, ordinary Parisians took to the streets, and through a combination of valiant fighting, shrewd diplomacy, and last-minute aid from the Allies, managed to save the City of Lights. <br><br>A groundbreaking, arresting narrative of the liberation, <i>The Blood of Free Men</i> tells the full story of one of the war's defining moments, when a tortured city and its inhabitants narrowly survived the deadliest conflict in human history.</p><p><b>Michael Neiberg</b> is professor of history in the Department of National Security and Strategy at the U.S. Army War College.

Neiberg skillfully describes six days of disorganized but bloody urban warfare between poorly armed Frenchmen and mostly unenthusiastic Germans until a French regiment, in defiance of Allied orders, entered the city. While hardly a great victory and followed by a nasty vengeance against collaborators, Paris's liberation produced ecstatic delight throughout the West, making it one of the few feel-good stories of the war, and Neiberg, with a close-up and evocative narrative, delivers a thoroughly satisfying history.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Dennis Showalter, author of <i>Hitler's Panzers</i></b><br> Michael Neiberg's talents as a scholar and storyteller brilliantly present the complex realities underlying the liberation of Paris in 1944, when the City of Light regained its freedom through the risks and sacrifices of its people.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br> Neiberg's taut narrative explains how the liberation played out....

Although a myriad of books have been written on World War II, Neiberg's work is freshly delivered with a love and passion for a city and its people that brings to life not only the fear and pain the city experienced under Nazi rule, but also for the hope its liberation inspired in Parisians and free men everywhere.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Roanoke Times</b></i><br> The liberation of Paris was an important symbolic event during the end game in World War II. Author Michael Neiberg's account of that liberation, <i>The Blood of Free Men</i>, explores the importance of Paris to the French and Americans, not the strategic value that other sites would have during World War II, but the emotional connection most Allied combatants felt toward the City of Light.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Maclean's</b></i><br> Historian Neiberg takes a new look at the liberation of Paris and how it narrowly escaped devastation....

A young reindeer has seven uncles, each one unique: "Uncle Dunce from Cameroon / bellows out an Elvis tune." Crazy Uncle Sy is "a fearless sort of guy" who gives "most any stunt a try."

While expositors of the second and third centuries viewed the Apocalypse of John, or Book of Revelation, as mainly about the time of Antichrist and the end of the world, in the late fourth century Tyconius interpreted John's visions as figurative of the struggles facing the Church throughout the entire period between the Incarnation and the Second Coming of Christ. Tyconius's "ecclesiastical" reading of the Apocalypse was highly regarded by early medieval commentators like Caesarius of Arles, Primasius of Hadrumetum, Bede, and Beatus of Liebana, who often quoted from Tyconius's <i>Exposition</i> in their own Apocalypse commentaries. Unfortunately no complete manuscript of the <i>Exposition</i> by Tyconius has survived. A number of recent scholars, however, believed that a large portion of his Exposition could be reconstructed from citations of it in the aforementioned early medieval writers; and this task was undertaken by Monsignor Roger Gryson. Gryson's edition, a reconstruction of the <i>Expositio Apocalypseos of Tyconius</i>, was published in 2011 in <i>Corpus Christianorum Series Latina</i>. The present translation of that reconstructed text, with introduction and notes, exhibits Tyconius's unique non-apocalyptic approach to the Book of Revelation. It also shows that throughout the Exposition Tyconius made use of interpretive rules that he had laid out in an earlier work on hermeneutics, the <i>Book of Rules</i>, strongly suggesting that Tyconius wrote his Exposition as a companion to his <i>Book of Rules</i>. Thus, the <i>Exposition</i> served as an exemplar of how those rules would apply to interpretation of even the most intriguing of biblical texts, the Apocalypse.</p><p>Tyconius of Carthage</p><h2>Where the Deer Were</h2><p>Pastoral, narrative, deliberately lyrical, the poetry of Kate Barnes is set solidly in the rural Maine countryside, and in the literary tradition in which is was raised (her father was Henry Beston, her mother Elizabeth Coatsworth).

They can also be used on land with artificial horizons. Sextants can also be used to find the correct Universal Time by measuring the angular distance between the moon and another body along its path across the zodiac. <br><br>In coastal waters or on land, sextants can be used for very accurate piloting by measuring the horizontal angles between charted landmarks. The vertical angle of a peak above its baseline determines the distance to it, which, combined with a compass bearing, yields a position fix from just one landmark. The angular dip of an object (island or vessel) below the visible horizon can also be used to determine the distance to it. <br><br>This booklet explains how to get the best results from plastic sextants, and presents numerical comparisons with similar data from metal sextants.

The paranormal is so ubiquitous in one form of entertainment or another that many people easily lose sight of the distinction between the real and the imaginary, or they never learn to make the distinction in the first place. In this thorough review of pseudoscience and the paranormal in contemporary life, psychologist Terence Hines teaches readers how to carefully evaluate all such claims in terms of scientific evidence.Hines devotes separate chapters to psychics; life after death; parapsychology; astrology; UFOs; ancient astronauts, cosmic collisions, and the Bermuda Triangle; faith healing; and more.

Laura Ingalls Wilder's <i>Little House</i> books have taught millions of Americans about frontier life, giving inspiration to many and in the process becoming icons of our national identity. Yet few realize that this cherished bestselling series wandered far from the actual history of the Ingalls family and from what Laura herself understood to be central truths about pioneer life.<br><br>In this groundbreaking narrative of literary detection, Christine Woodside reveals for the first time the full extent of the collaboration between Laura and her daughter, Rose Wilder Lane. Rose hated farming and fled the family homestead as an adolescent, eventually becoming a nationally prominent magazine writer, biographer of Herbert Hoover, and successful novelist, who shared the political values of Ayn Rand and became mentor to Roger Lea MacBride, the second Libertarian presidential candidate. Drawing on original manuscripts and letters, Woodside shows how Rose reshaped her mother's story into a series of heroic tales that rebutted the policies of the New Deal. Their secret collaboration would lead in time to their estrangement. A fascinating look at the relationship between two strong-willed women, <i>Libertarians on the Prairie</i> is also the deconstruction of an American myth.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, along with our Arcade, Good Books, Sports Publishing, and Yucca imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs.

His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#39;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club.

From the earliest European explorers trading with Native Americans to today's Internet shoppers, consumerism has driven American society.

The first book on this topic to span the four centuries from the colonial era to the present, and the first to propose theoretical frameworks, the volume brings consumer society to the center of American history. Indeed, its authors demonstrate the many ways their research enhances knowledge of a broad range of historical topics, such as politics, labor ideology, immigrant life, and race, gender, and class relations. By including types of consumer studies which are seldom linked, this volume offers both a basis for historical synthesis and a springboard for further inquiry. </p><p>With contributions by Raymond Williams, Jean Baudrillard, Juliet B.

Carefully she packed her pipe with tobacco and, shielding the sparks from the wind with her hand, lit it with her flint. With a sigh of pleasure, she drew in a lungful of sharp-scented smoke. For a long moment she held it in her lungs, then breathed it out in a long plume that was dragged away by the frosty breeze.</p><p>She inhaled again, leant back her head and puffed out a series of perfect blue smoke-rings. As far as she could see there was no sign of life, only the sharp spears of snow-laden pines crowding close about the feet of towering grey mountains. &#x201c;Does anything ever happen in Rurach?&#x201d; she said to the elven cat curled on her lap. &#x201c;Flaming dragon balls, I&#x2019;m as bored as a eunuch in a brothel!&#x201d;</p><p>Goblin yawned, showing a mouthful of tiny but very sharply pointed fangs. &#x201c;I canna help agreeing,&#x201d; Finn said. &#x201c;Do ye think we should run away and join the pirates? At least then we&#x2019;d see some adventure.&#x201d;</p><p>The cat arched its back and hissed.</p><p>&#x201c;No? Ye do no&#x2019; like that idea? No, o&#x2019; course, ye dislike water. Ye would no&#x2019; have to swim in it though. I believe the pirate ships are quite snug and there&#x2019;d be fish to eat every day.&#x201d;</p><p>Goblin tidied up her whiskers, not deigning to reply. Finn sighed again and stared up at the sharp silhouette of the Fang. For once, it was not wreathed in clouds but cut into the sky like a sabre leopard&#x2019;s tooth, dominating the horizon.</p><p>When Finn had first seen the sleeping volcano, she had been troubled by an odd sense of recognition. It had woken all sorts of half-memories in her, a longing or homesickness that she had not then understood She had then been travelling through the mountains of upper Rionnagan, on the far side of the Fang, and to her knowledge had never seen the tall, symmetrically shaped mountain before. As far as she knew, Finn had never before left the city of Lucescere where she had lived on the streets, picking pockets and begging for scraps of old food in order to survive.</p><p>Finn had been one of a gang of beggar children who had had to flee Lucescere after helping Jorge the Seer and his young acolyte T�mas the Healer escape from the cruel seekers of the Awl, the Anti-Witchcraft League. That had been in the days when suspected witches were burnt to death. In company with the old, blind man and the little boy, Finn and her gang had taken refuge from the Awl in a hidden valley at the very foot of the Fang. There they had formed the League of the Healing Hand, a fellowship sworn to protect the two witches who, despite having such potent magical abilities, were in themselves frail and rather helpless. The League had ended up being very important in the overthrow of the Awl and the restoration of the Coven, and had earned the heartfelt gratitude of the new R�gh, Lachlan MacCuinn.</p><p>Remembering, Finn thought rather wistfully that those years had been the happiest of her life. Although there was always the danger of losing a hand as a pickpocket or being captured as a rebel, there had been the close comradeship of the gang and the constant thrill of pitting one&#x2019;s wits against the world and winning. Although Finn was never cold or hungry anymore, she was lonely now and sullen with misery. The constraints of court life chafed her unbearably and she felt all the court ladies, including her own mother, disapproved of her greatly.</p><p>It had been five years since Finn had discovered she was not an orphan of the streets, as she had thought, but the daughter of the prionnsa of Rurach. She had been kidnapped by the Awl as a mere child of six in order to force her father to their will. She had only discovered the truth during the Samhain rebellion which had put Lachlan MacCuinn on the throne and returned the Coven to power. Her father had then brought her back to Rurach, to meet a mother she had not remembered, and to learn to be a banprionnsa. Although Finn had felt a wrench at leaving her friends, she had been eager to see her home and her mother and to enjoy a life of ease.</p><p>But although Castle Rurach was as luxurious and comfortable as she had imagined, it was also boring. Built high in the mountains, it was a long way from the crowded streets of Lucescere, with its merchants, artisans, street performers, thieves and idle nobility. A young lady of Rurach was expected to spend her time with the other ladies of the court, plying her needle in exquisite embroidery and discussing the newest way to cut a sleeve. Finn had no interest in fashion, refused to learn how to sew, and thought of her mother&#x2019;s retinue as a gaggle of fussy old hens.</p><p>The towering range of mountains that culminated in the crooked spire of the Fang was no longer a source of wistful longings but instead a prison wall which kept her locked away from the world with no chance of escape. If Finn had known the secret way over the mountains, she would have run away long ago, searching out her old friends in Lucescere. She did not know it, however, and so she took what pleasure she could in defying her mother and shocking the castle.</p><p>Goblin had curled up to sleep but suddenly the little cat raised her head, ears pricked forward. Finn tensed. She heard a step on the stair. She knocked out her pipe with one hand and thrust the other into her pocket, drawing out a small square of tightly folded black material. With a shake it billowed out into a cloak which she wrapped around her swiftly. Wherever the silky stuff brushed against her skin, it tingled and stung, and all the little hairs rose. She pulled the hood up to cover her face, and sat very still.</p><p>A gangly young man came out on to the battlements and stood hesitantly. Her father&#x2019;s piper, he was dressed in the castle livery, a black and green kilt with a white woollen shirt and black jerkin. Although he had wrapped his plaid around his thin shoulders, it was bitterly cold out on the tower heights and he shivered and rubbed his arms.</p><p>&#x201c;My lady Fionnghal?&#x201d; Ashlin the Piper called. &#x201c;Are ye here? Your mother desires your presence. My lady?&#x201d;</p><p>Finn said nothing. Ashlin stared about with a troubled expression and called her again. When there was no response he turned and clattered back downstairs. Finn stuck out her tongue at his retreating back and shrugged off the cloak, which somehow always made her feel even colder. She huddled her furs closer around her neck and brought out her precious hoard of tobacco. &#x201c;Why canna they ever leave me alone?&#x201d; she said resentfully to the cat, who was still curled up on her lap. &#x201c;Always following me about, spying on me, tittle-tattling. Anyone would think they had naught else to do.&#x201d;</p><p>She puffed on her pipe angrily, kicking her legs against the stone. &#x201c;I wish my <i>dai-dein</i> would get better,&#x201d; she burst out in a sudden wail, then bit the stem of her pipe hard and said no more. Her father Anghus MacRuraich had been injured fighting ogres in the mountains and had lain near death for a week. Although the castle healer had told them his fever had broken and he would now recover, Finn could not help fearing he might suffer a relapse.</p><p>She was knocking out the ashes from her pipe when she suddenly felt a prickling at the back of her neck. She glanced over her shoulder and saw an old man step quietly out of the doorway. He was a short, stocky figure with a flowing grey beard, round pink cheeks and blue eyes twinkling between deep creases. He was her father&#x2019;s gillie and had served Anghus ever since the laird had been a mere lad himself. Finn did not know him very well since he rarely left her father&#x2019;s side and so had been absent from the castle most of the time since she had come to Rurach. His kilt was so faded it was a comfortable blur of grey and olive, and he wore his beard thrust through the wide belt that held his kilt together. A thin dagger, black as jet, was stuck through the disreputable scrap of ribbon holding up one stocking. The other stocking was tied up with twine.</p><p>&#x201c;Och, there ye are, my lady,&#x201d; Donald said placidly. &#x201c;Bonny afternoon for a smoke.&#x201d; Finn said nothing. He came to lean on the battlement beside her, looking up at the mountains and feeling inside his sporran for his pipe and tobacco pouch. Swiftly, without a glance downwards, he packed his pipe and stuck it in the corner of his mouth. &#x201c;Smells like Fair Isles smokeweed ye&#x2019;ve got there,&#x201d; he said conversationally. &#x201c;True tobacco is rare these days, wha&#x2019; wi&#x2019; pirates and the blaygird Fairgean on the rise. Most have to smoke herbs or seaweed these days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here, have some o&#x2019; mine,&#x201d; Finn said sweetly, offering him her own leather pouch.</p><p>&#x201c;Och, no need,&#x201d; Donald replied. &#x201c;I won a pouch full from Casey Hawkeye just last night. He be the lucky one, his uncle being the harbour master at D�n Gorm and taking his taxes in tobacco. I should have enough to last me a wee while longer.&#x201d;</p><p>There was silence while Donald lit his pipe and drew up the flame. When the tobacco was burning merrily, he pulled the pipe from his mouth and said placidly, &#x201c;The question is, lassie, where it is ye got your smokeweed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do no&#x2019; see what business that is o&#x2019; yours.&#x201d; Finn&#x2019;s voice was honey-sweet. &#x201c;And I do no&#x2019; think my dear mother would approve o&#x2019; ye being so familiar as to call me &#x2018;lassie&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Och, I have kent your mother since she was a wee bit o&#x2019; a lassie herself. She&#x2019;ll no&#x2019; mind,&#x201d; he replied equably. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s more likely that she&#x2019;ll be disapproving o&#x2019; ye smoking a pipe, that I can promise ye.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, ye think so? If only I had kent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And even more o&#x2019; ye stealing, lassie,&#x201d; he said softly.</p><p>Finn flushed and fidgeted with the tassels of her coat. She forced herself to raise her eyes and meet his gaze with a look of outrage. &#x201c;Are ye accusing me o&#x2019; theft?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lassie, do no&#x2019; be lying to me on top o&#x2019; it all. I ken ye must have stolen the smokeweed from Casey Hawkeye and he kens it as well. No&#x2019; that he has said aught and naught is what he will say. We do no&#x2019; wish to be getting ye into any more strife than ye&#x2019;re already in. But I am sore ashamed o&#x2019; ye, lassie. It is one thing to be picking pockets when ye&#x2019;re starving on the streets and do no&#x2019; ken any better, but to be diddling your father&#x2019;s own loyal men, that is no&#x2019; worthy o&#x2019; ye.&#x201d;</p><p>Finn was silent. She held the elven cat up to her face and rubbed her hot cheek against Goblin&#x2019;s cool fur. Donald smoked in silence for a while, leaning on his elbows. His wrinkled brown face was peaceful.</p><p>&#x201c;It does no&#x2019; matter what I do, she disapproves o&#x2019; everything anyway,&#x201d; Finn suddenly burst out. &#x201c;Ye&#x2019;re right, she does no&#x2019; approve o&#x2019; me smoking or having a wee dram o&#x2019; whiskey every now and again, or wanting to play curling wi&#x2019; the lads...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Och, well, curling do be a right rough game now,&#x201d; Donald said. She threw him a look of exasperation and saw his blue eyes were twinkling. &#x201c;Ye mun remember that our mam was raised in the auld ways, when lassies did no&#x2019; have so much freedom and were expected to mind their manners and do wha&#x2019; they were told. Your grandfather was a very strict, starched-up sort o&#x2019; fellow, and proud o&#x2019; his name and his clan. Your mam was never allowed to forget she was a banprionnsa and direct descendant o&#x2019; Sian the Storm-Rider herself.&#x201d;</p><p>Finn screwed up her face and he patted her shoulder. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s gone and worrit herself into a fret over ye, lassie. Should ye no&#x2019; go down and let her ken ye&#x2019;re safe?&#x201d;</p><p>Finn&#x2019;s jaw set firmly. &#x201c;What has she got to worry about so? It&#x2019;s no&#x2019; as if I&#x2019;m ever allowed to do anything or go anywhere. What can I do to hurt myself? Prick myself with a needle? Stub my toe kicking my mealy-mouthed cousin in the arse?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fall over the battlements?&#x201d; Donald said with a slight edge to his voice. He glanced down at Finn, still sitting in the embrasure with nothing between her and the ground but three hundred feet of air. &#x201c;That is no&#x2019; the safest place to perch, lassie.&#x201d;</p><p>Finn glanced down. &#x201c;Do ye no&#x2019; ken they call me &#x2018;the Cat&#x2019;?&#x201d; she said mockingly. &#x201c;A wee drop like that does no&#x2019; worry me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It worries all o&#x2019; us who care about ye though,&#x201d; Donald said, the edge in his voice slightly sharper.</p><p>&#x201c;Are ye trying to tell me my dear mother would really care if I fell off?&#x201d; Finn tried to make her voice hard and sarcastic. &#x201c;She&#x2019;d probably heave a big sigh o&#x2019; relief to be rid o&#x2019; me and another o&#x2019; happiness that her precious Aindrew would then inherit the throne. Ye canna tell me she does no&#x2019; wish he was the firstborn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can and I do.&#x201d; For the first time since Finn had met her father&#x2019;s gillie, there was no kindly twinkle in his eyes. &#x201c;When the blaygird Awl took ye away, I thought your mam would die o&#x2019; grief. Her eyes hung out o&#x2019; her head wi&#x2019; weeping and she was naught but a shadow o&#x2019; herself all the time ye were gone. I was there when your father brought ye back to Castle Rurach. Ye canna tell me ye did no&#x2019; see how full o&#x2019; joy she was to have ye home!&#x201d;</p><p>Finn dro...</p></p><h2>Sovereignty or Submission: Will Americans Rule Themselves or be Ruled by Others?</h2><p>The International Criminal Court claims authority over Americans for actions that the United States does not define as crimes.&#x201d; In short, the Twenty-First Century is witnessing an epic struggle between the forces of global governance and American constitutional democracy. Transnational progressives and transnational pragmatists in the UN, EU, post-modern states of Europe, NGOs, corporations, prominent foundations, and most importantly, in America&#x2019;s leading elites, seek to establish global governance.&#x201d; Further, they understand that in order to achieve global governance, American sovereignty must be subordinated to the global rule of law.&#x201d; The U.S. Constitution must incorporate evolving norms of international law.&#x201d; <i>Sovereignty or Submission</i> examines this process with crystalline clarity and alerts the American public to the danger ahead.<br> <br>Global governance seeks legitimacy not in democracy, but in a partisan interpretation of human rights. It would shift power from democracies (U.S., Israel, India) to post-democratic authorities, such as the judges of the International Criminal Court. Global governance is a new political form (a rival to liberal democracy), that is already a significant actor on the world stage. America faces serious challenges from radical Islam and a rising China. Simultaneously, it faces a third challenge (global governance) that is internal to the democratic world; is non-violent; but nonetheless threatens constitutional self-government. Although it seems unlikely that the utopian goals of the globalists could be fully achieved, if they continue to obtain a wide spread influence over mainstream elite opinion, they could disable and disarm democratic self-government at home and abroad. The result would be the slow suicide of American liberal democracy. Whichever side prevails, the existential conflict?global governance versus American sovereignty (and democratic self-government in general) will be at the heart of world politics as far as the eye can see.</p><p>John Fonte joined the Hudson Institute in March 1999 as a senior fellow and director of the Center for American Common Culture.

Was the stranger&#x2019;s death an accident or something more sinister? It&#x2019;s up to Officer Gunnhildur, a sardonic female cop, to find out. Her investigation uncovers a web of corruption connected to Iceland&#x2019;s business and banking communities. Meanwhile, a rookie crime journalist latches on to her, looking for a scoop, and an anonymous blogger is stirring up trouble. The complications increase, as do the stakes, when a second murder is committed.</p><p><strong>A Note to Readers from Quentin Bates</strong> <p>Much of what became <em>Frozen Assets </em>took shape during Iceland's financial boom. Reykjav�k prospered and the country's bankers were hailed as financial wonders who appeared to have dug up a whole cache of Philosopher's Stones.</p> <p>Grumpy cynics had wondered when the bubble would burst, what would happen when all those private jets, limousines, and other status symbols had to be paid for. But the problem didn't lie solely with Iceland's nouveau riche maxing out credit cards on expensive toys. With banks frantically pushing bizarre dollar-euro-yen-franc loans at them, ordinary working families stockpiled luxury goods at a brisk clip.</p> <p>I spent much of 2008 in Iceland. In January everything was normal, if you consider a super-heated economy and sky-high prices normal. By springtime things were less comfortable. The exchange rate had started to slide for the first time in years and although nothing was said out loud, it was common knowledge that the banks' coffers were bare. Business was starting to slow, despite the forest of cranes dotting the skyline. There was a nagging uncertainty that maybe the economic miracle wasn't quite as copper-bottomed as people had been told.</p> <p>By summer, fear had permeated the society. Government and trade declared business as usual, but my friends and relatives all told me the same thing; behind the window-dressing, things were looking grim. Every working Joe knew something was brewing, without knowing what it was or when it would happen. Few people seriously believed the government was telling the whole truth.</p> <p>For a few months in the summer I stayed away, working on <em>Frozen Assets</em>. My rotund heroine, Gunna, had already jumped onto the page with a frown on her face and taken on a life of her own.</p> <p>Back in Iceland for an extended visit in October, I arrived on the day that the first of Iceland's hyper-inflated banks admitted that they'd been doing the equivalent of paying their Visa bills with Mastercard, and the government stepped in to help them out.</p> <p>An old friend greeted me with the words, "Congratulate me on my bank."</p> <p>"Why's that?"</p> <p>"Haven&#x2019;t you heard? Glitnir's been nationalized. It belongs to the taxpayer now--that's me."</p> <p>People were stunned, not so much by the fact that the bank had failed, but at the sheer depth of the corruption, greed, and incompetence behind that failure. Somehow Icelanders have always been tacitly resigned to the corruption of those in power, but this was taking things to a new high. As a writer, I couldn't help but feel a guilty thrill. It was fantastic material. I knew I had to rewrite <em>Frozen Assets</em> so that the last chapters would coincide with the dramatic events of 2008.</p> <p>Re-drafting <em>Frozen Assets</em> in the winter of 2008-09, I couldn't fathom the scale of what had happened, and even today, two years after the crash, new revelations are still coming to light.</p> <p>Hopefully <em>Frozen Assets </em>captures the desperate atmosphere in Iceland as its economy skidded toward the rocks. Without question, the fallout in the aftermath of the crash will reverberate through the rest of the series, just as it will for the residents of Iceland for many years to come.</p>Quentin Bates lived in Iceland for ten years, during which time he got married, produced a family, and generally went native.

Mike Horton was the first to regain his voice. <br>&#x201c;You sure we&#x2019;re at the right place?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You saw the sign pointin&#x2019; this way,&#x201d; said Webb. <br>&#x201c;I reckon this is a fool question,&#x201d; Jim Roussel said, &#x201c;but where do we go from here?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Santa Fe,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s clear enough what happened, and somebody had to bury Warren and his wife, so we&#x2019;ll go callin&#x2019; on the county sheriff. Then we&#x2019;ll have to find some hombre that can afford five thousand Texas longhorns. Red, why don&#x2019;t you ride with me. The rest of you take the herd back along the river and wait for us.&#x201d; <br>Wordlessly the rest of the riders obeyed, as Webb and Bohannon rode upriver toward Santa Fe. They had no trouble finding the sheriff&#x2019;s office. The lawman sat at a desk cleaning his Colt. He got to his feet when they entered. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Don Webb and this is Red Bohannon.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sheriff Carpenter. What can I do for you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not much, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;Warren Blocker was a friend of ours, and we just came from his place. What was left of it. What can you tell us?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not a lot,&#x201d; Carpenter replied. &#x201c;Couple of sheepmen found &#x2019;em, and they was dead and buried a week, before I heard about it. I took a posse out there, but the trail was cold. A dozen riders headed south, and we lost &#x2019;em when they split up. Renegades, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; said Webb, &#x201c;but why single out the Blockers? We saw only one horse, and not another head of stock anywhere.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Money,&#x201d; Sheriff Carpenter said. &#x201c;The Blockers came from southern Arizona, and first thing they done was deposit forty thousand dollars in the local bank. It was no secret that Blocker had made his fortune in mining, and just a few days before his place was raided, he took thirty-five thousand out of the bank. I reckon I shouldn&#x2019;t speak ill of the dead, but it was a foolish thing to do.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Under the circumstances, I&#x2019;d have to agree with you,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;Thanks for the information.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry I couldn&#x2019;t be of more help,&#x201d; Sheriff Carpenter said. <br>Webb and Bohannon closed the door behind them and stood on the boardwalk looking around. <br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;I see a livery sign, and that&#x2019;s usually where most livestock is bought and sold.&#x201d; <br>The livery barn was large, and the office door was at one corner, in the front. Above the door was a sign that read LIVESTOCK BOUGHT AND SOLD. JORDAN WINKLER, PROP. <br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; the big man said, easing his chair down to its front legs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Winkler.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Webb and Bohannon,&#x201d; said Don. &#x201c;We have Texas cattle to sell. Prime, two-year-olds and under.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How many?&#x201d; Winkler asked cautiously. <br>&#x201c;Fifty-five hundred,&#x201d; said Webb. <br>Winkler whistled long and low, shaking his head. <br>&#x201c;Folks around here don&#x2019;t like beef?&#x201d; Red Bohannon asked. <br>&#x201c;Not that much of it, friend,&#x201d; said Winkler. &#x201c;This is sheep country. Most folks around here are third and fourth generation Mexican, and they was livin&#x2019; here while this territory still belonged to Mexico. They&#x2019;re mostly mutton eaters. Them that&#x2019;s partial to beef is them that&#x2019;s come here from Missouri and Texas. I&#x2019;ll take two hundred head, twenty dollars per.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thirty dollars,&#x201d; Webb said. <br>&#x201c;Twenty,&#x201d; said Winkler. &#x201c;No more.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Twenty-five,&#x201d; Webb countered. <br>&#x201c;Twenty,&#x201d; said Winkler. <br>Webb sighed. &#x201c;Two hundred head, twenty dollars a head.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll want a bill of sale,&#x201d; said Winkler. &#x201c;When can you have them here?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;In the morning,&#x201d; Webb said. &#x201c;Do you have pens?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Winkler, &#x201c;just a corral, and it&#x2019;s full of mules. Just drive the cows here, and I&#x2019;ll have some riders to take charge of them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;One thing more,&#x201d; Webb said. &#x201c;Do you know of anybody, anywhere, who might buy the rest of our herd? We&#x2019;ll sell at twenty dollars a head.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ellerbee and Sons in Los Angeles will take them,&#x201d; said Winkler, &#x201c;and they&#x2019;ll pay lots more than twenty dollars. Couple of years back, they bought three thousand head of sheep from here. Send &#x2019;em a telegram, ask if they&#x2019;ll buy, and ask for a quote.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Webb said. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the telegraph office?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Take a left out of here, and it&#x2019;s a block up the street,&#x201d; said Winkler. <br>They were almost to the telegraph office when Bohannon spoke. <br>&#x201c;You forgot to ask how far it is to Los Angeles, and how we&#x2019;re to get there.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t forget,&#x201d; Webb said grimly. &#x201c;We got no choice but to go, even if it&#x2019;s three thousand miles. You reckon Texas cowboys can&#x2019;t take a herd of longhorns where Mexicans drove three thousand damn sheep?&#x201d; <br>Bohannon laughed, and they paused outside the telegraph office, pooling their meager resources to pay for the telegram. They entered, and taking a yellow form and a pencil, Webb wrote out the message: Have 5,000 head prime two-year-old Texas steers. Stop. If buying telegraph quote. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll wait for an answer,&#x201d; said Webb, as he paid for the telegram. <br>&#x201c;Might not have it &#x2019;fore tomorrow,&#x201d; the telegrapher said. &#x201c;We close at six.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll wait till six, and if it hasn&#x2019;t come, then we&#x2019;ll be back tomorrow,&#x201d; Webb said. <br>&#x201c;Tarnation,&#x201d; said Red, when they left the telegraph office, &#x201c;ever&#x2019;thing&#x2019;s ridin&#x2019; on that telegram. We&#x2019;re in one hell of a mess if they don&#x2019;t answer. Denver&#x2019;s God knows how far to the north, Mejicano land&#x2019;s to the south, and the war&#x2019;s comin&#x2019; to Texas.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That telegram&#x2019;s got to pay off,&#x201d; Webb replied. &#x201c;While we&#x2019;re waitin&#x2019; for an answer, we can maybe learn something about the trail to Los Angeles. Let&#x2019;s find out if there&#x2019;s a newspaper in town.&#x201d; <br>The Santa Fe Chief occupied a small office across the street from the jail, and when the Texans entered, an elderly lady looked at them over the tops of her spectacles. Don wasted no time. <br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, we have some cattle we aim to trail to Los Angeles. We&#x2019;ve heard other stock has been driven there, and we&#x2019;re needin&#x2019; some directions.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re talking about the Old Spanish Trail,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and there&#x2019;s twelve hundred miles of it. We used to print a map when it was in regular use. Perhaps I can find one.&#x201d; <br>One entire wall of the office was lined with shelves, each of them sagging under a load of what obviously were back issues of the newspaper. Eventually she presented them with a yellowed edition of the newspaper. <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a full-page map in here,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re obliged, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;What do we owe you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; she said, with a grim smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll hate me before you reach Los Angeles.&#x201d; <br>Thirty minutes before the telegraph office was to close, a reply came from Ellerbee and Sons in Los Angeles. It said: Buying at sixty dollars a head. Stop. Confirm delivery date. <br>Speechless, Webb and Bohannon left the telegraph office, pausing to read the brief message again. <br>&#x201c;Lord Almighty,&#x201d; said Bohannon, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s three hundred thousand dollars for the five thousand head. I ain&#x2019;t believin&#x2019; it&#x2019;s possible for a bunch of hard-scrabble Texans like us to get our hands on that kind of money. Not with the country at war.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;California&#x2019;s a hell of a long ways from the war,&#x201d; Webb said, &#x201c;and it ain&#x2019;t that many years since they discovered gold. They got the money and we got the cows, and if some joker gets overly interested, we&#x2019;re from New Mexico, not Texas.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s sound thinking,&#x201d; said Bohannon. &#x201c;It&#x2019;d be just like the Federals to take our herd or the money.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not as long as I&#x2019;m alive and with a gun in my hand,&#x201d; Webb said. <br>&#x201c;After Ellerbee&#x2019;s quote of sixty dollars a head, twenty dollars don&#x2019;t seem like much,&#x201d; said Bohannon, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;ll be enough to keep us in grub from here to California.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I reckon,&#x201d; Webb agreed, &#x201c;but that presents another problem. Enough grub for ten of us over twelve hundred miles purely won&#x2019;t fit on two pack mules. We&#x2019;ll need four more.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Winkler has a corral full of &#x2019;em,&#x201d; said Bohannon, &#x201c;and when he pays us for the two hundred cows, we&#x2019;ll have money.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I reckon we&#x2019;d better see him and arrange to buy another four mules,&#x201d; Webb said. &#x201c;He may have the pack saddles too.&#x201d; <br>Again Winkler was leaned back in his chair, looking as though he likely hadn&#x2019;t moved since they&#x2019;d last seen him. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re much obliged to you,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;Ellerbee&#x2019;s agreed to buy the rest of the herd. Now we&#x2019;re needin&#x2019; four more pack mules to see us through to California.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help you,&#x201d; Winkler said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve almost never got any for sale, and I got none now.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You got a corral full of &#x2019;em,&#x201d; said Bohannon. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t bear to part with at least four?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If they was mine, I&#x2019;d sell you the whole damn bunch,&#x201d; Winkler said shortly. &#x201c;I took &#x2019;em on for a couple of days, feedin&#x2019; &#x2019;em for a gent name of Starnes. Him and his riders is takin&#x2019; &#x2019;em south, to sell in the minin&#x2019; camps. You&#x2019;ll have to talk to Starnes. He&#x2019;s at the Santa Fe Hotel, and he&#x2019;s tight as the bark on a tree.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk to him.&#x201d; <br>Webb and Bohannon found Henry Starnes at the hotel, and he listened to their plea. <br>&#x201c;That bunch of hee-haws will bring a hundred and fifty dollars apiece in the mining camps,&#x201d; Starnes said, &#x201c;and I won&#x2019;t sell for a penny less.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re still a long way from the mining camps,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;A hundred apiece.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Forget it,&#x201d; Starnes said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re wasting my time.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then maybe this will interest you,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;We have a herd of Texas steers, all two-year-olds or less, and prime. We&#x2019;ve been quoted sixty dollars a head for them in the mining camps. We&#x2019;ll swap you three of them for one mule.&#x201d; <br>Starnes laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a long way from the mining camps. If I was interested and I liked the looks of your herd, I might swap. One mule for four cows.&#x201d; <br>Webb swallowed his anger. Starnes was taking unfair advantage, and there was nothing they could do but accept. <br>&#x201c;The herd&#x2019;s downriver maybe ten miles,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you ride down there with us? Winkler&#x2019;s buying two hundred head. We can drive yours here along with his.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If they&#x2019;re good enough for Winkler, they&#x2019;re good enough for me,&#x201d; Starnes said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll swap with you at Winkler&#x2019;s in the morning. I&#x2019;ll expect a bill of sale.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have one,&#x201d; said Webb shortly, &#x201c;and we&#x2019;ll expect one from you.&#x201d; <br>Webb and Bohannon mounted their horses and rode south along the Pecos. When the rest of the outfit saw them coming, they gathered around. First, Don told them of the quote from Ellerbee in Los Angeles, and emerging from what had seemed like certain defeat, they broke into a round of cheers. Their jubilation knew no bounds when they learned of the sale of two hundred head to Winkler, but there was anger on every face when they were told of the expensive trade for four additional mules. <br>&#x201c;Damn it,&#x201d; said Bob Vines, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll have money comin&#x2019; for the two hundred head. We&#x2019;d have been better off, just payin&#x2019; the hundred and fifty dollars per mule.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; Webb said, &#x201c;because Winkler&#x2019;s only payin&#x2019; twenty dollars a head. I know two thousand dollars sounds like a lot, us all bein&#x2019; broke, but we can spare the cows and I reckoned we&#x2019;d need the money for grub.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You done exactly the right thing,&#x201d; said Jim Roussel. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care how long and hard this Old Spanish Trail is, long as we got plenty of grub. Maybe we can buy coffee too.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s two mercantiles,&#x201d; Red Bohannon said. &#x201c;I saw &#x2019;em.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Once we&#x2019;ve collected from Winkler,&#x201d; said Webb, &#x201c;I think each of us should have fifty dollars for personal use. The rest will be used for supplies and grub. Anybody object to that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s more than fair,&#x201d; Charlie English said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember how long it&#x2019;s been since I had fifty dollars I didn&#x2019;t owe somebody.&#x201d; <br>They all shouted their agreement, and while there was still daylight, they gathered for a look at the map of the Old Spanish Trail. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look all that bad,&#x201d; said Mike Horton, &#x201c;if it&#x2019;s anywhere close to right. There&#x2019;s a lot of rivers. At least through most of Utah Territory.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I been to the High Plains a time or two,&#x201d; Felton Juneau said, &#x201c;and in the mountains there&#x2019;s always springs.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope that&#x2019;s the case between here and California,&#x201d; said Don Webb. &#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be mountains aplenty.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine that much territory without Indians,&#x201d; Arch Danson said. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;d better do some askin&#x2019; around, before we go lopin&#x2019; along that trail.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We will,&#x201d; said Don Webb. &#x201c;Red and me had a lot to do, all in one day. Now that we have some money comin&#x2019; in Santa Fe, the pack mules that we need, and a buyer in Los Angeles, we can start lookin&#x2019; at some other things.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Maybe one of them other things can be a pair of wranglers,&#x201d; Les Brown said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d use my fifty dollars toward payin&#x2019; &#x2019;em, just to get the pack mules and the horse remuda away from the drag steers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll consider that,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see what&#x2019;s left, after we&#x2019;ve bought supplies.&#x201d; <br>Next morning, shortly after first light, the outfit had cut out two hundred and sixteen head from the herd. <br>&#x201c;Mike, Red, Charlie, and me will drive &#x2019;em into town,&#x201d; Webb said. &#x201c;The rest of you stay with the herd. Once we&#x2019;ve collected our money, all of you will have a chance to ride in, to take care of personal needs and to help decide on supplies we&#x2019;ll need for the drive on to California.&#x201d; <br>When Webb and his companions reached town with the herd, the livery was open for business and Winkler was waiting for them. <br>&#x201c;They are prime,&#x201d; said Winkler. &#x201c;Wish it was so I could afford more of &#x2019;em.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I reckon it&#x2019;s just as well you can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Webb said. &#x201c;After that quote from Ellerbee, we couldn&#x2019;t afford to sell &#x2019;em to you. There&#x2019;s two hundred and sixteen. We traded sixteen of them to Starnes for four mules.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I told you he was tight,&#x201d; said Winkler. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s fifty of the varmints, and he tried to talk me into grainin&#x2019; the lot of &#x2019;em for three days, at ten dollars a day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That reminds me,&#x201d; Webb said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know what the graze is like along this Old Spanish Trail, so we&#x2019;ll need grain for our horses and mules. How are you fixed for that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just had a supply train in from St. Joe,&#x201d; said Winkler, &#x201c;so I got shelled corn. But you&#x2019;d better make a deal for it before Starnes moves out. He&#x2019;ll be needin&#x2019; a lot of it for his mules.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s finalize our deal for the cows,&#x201d; Webb said, &#x201c;and we&#x2019;ll go ahead and pay for some corn. We&#x2019;ve had our share of troubles already.&#x201d; <br>By the time the Texans had swapped bills of sale with Winkler and had collected their money, Henry Starnes and two of his riders were looking over the herd. <br>&#x201c;Satisfied?&#x201d; Webb asked. <br>Starnes nodded, producing a bill of sale for four mules. In turn, Webb handed him a signed bill for sixteen head of steers. Starnes&#x2019; two riders entered the corral with lead ropes and led out four mules. <br>&#x201c;The lead ropes are not included,&#x201d; Starnes said. <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t reckon they would be,&#x201d; said Webb. &#x201c;We have our own.&#x201d; <br>Winkler looked at Starnes in disgust, but Starnes seemed not to notice. His riders were cutting out his sixteen head of cows. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re supposed to have those mules out of my corral today,&#x201d; Winkler said. &#x201c;When?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Soon as the rest of my outfit gets here,&#x201d; said Starnes shortly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be needin&#x2019; grain.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already sold most of it,&#x201d; Winkler said with some satisfaction, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;re welcome to what&#x2019;s left.&#x201d; <br>Winkler had three riders in charge of the cattle, and he spoke to them. <br>&#x201c;Keep them bunched here until those mules are gone. Then herd them into the corral and give them some hay.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Winkler,&#x201d; Webb said, &#x201c;before we take these mules back to camp, do you have have pack saddles?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I have four,&#x201d; said Winkler. &#x201c;By the time folks get here, they generally have their pack saddles. Not much call for them, so you can have them all for twenty-five dollars.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re obliged,&#x201d; Webb said. &#x201c;...</p><h2>Info-Psychology: A Manual for the Use of the Human Nervous System According to the Instructions of the Manufacturers, and a Navigational Guide for Piloting the Evolution of the Human Individual</h2><p>Dr. Leary explores the real issues of our time--Space Migration, Intelligence Increase and Life Extension--in this "Manual on the Use of the Human Nervous System according to the Instructions of the Manufacturers."<p>"The Info-Worlds our species will discover, create, explore and inhabit in the immediate future will not be reached from launch pads alone, but also through our personal computer screens."</p></p><p>Timothy Leary, Ph.D., was a respected Harvard psychology professor who became a guru for hundreds of thousands of people, espousing the use of the powerful hallucinogen LSD and other mind-altering drugs as a means of brain change.

Ferrell Book Prize<p></p></i><p><i>Financial Missionaries to the World</i> establishes the broad scope and significance of "dollar diplomacy"&#x2014;the use of international lending and advising&#x2014;to early-twentieth-century U.S. foreign policy. Combining diplomatic, economic, and cultural history, the distinguished historian Emily S. Rosenberg shows how private bank loans were extended to leverage the acceptance of American financial advisers by foreign governments. In an analysis striking in its relevance to contemporary debates over international loans, she reveals how a practice initially justified as a progressive means to extend &#x201c;civilization&#x201d; by promoting economic stability and progress became embroiled in controversy. Vocal critics at home and abroad charged that American loans and financial oversight constituted a new imperialism that fostered exploitation of less powerful nations. By the mid-1920s, Rosenberg explains, even early supporters of dollar diplomacy worried that by facilitating excessive borrowing, the practice might induce the very instability and default that it supposedly worked against.<br><i><br></i>"[A] major and superb contribution to the history of U.S. foreign relations. . . .

Sharpe and The Creation of American Military Intelligence in the Civil War</h2><p>The vital role of the military all-source intelligence in the eastern theater of operations during the U.S. Civil War is told through the biography of its creator, George H. Sharpe. Renowned historian Peter Tsouras contends that this creation under Sharpe&#x2019;s leadership was the combat multiplier that ultimately allowed the Union to be victorious.<br><br>Sharpe is celebrated as one of the most remarkable Americans of the 19th century. He built an intelligence organization (The Bureau of Military Information &#x2013; BMI) from a standing start beginning in February 1863. He was the first man in military history to create a professional all-source intelligence operation, defined by the U.S. Army as &#x201c;the intelligence products, organizations, and activities that incorporates all sources of information, in the production of intelligence.&#x201d; By early 1863, in the two and half months before the Chancellorsville Campaign, Sharpe had conducted a breath-taking Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB) effort. His reports identified every brigade and its location in Lee&#x2019;s army, provided an accurate order-of-battle down to the regiment level and a complete analysis of the railroad. The eventual failure of the campaign was outside of the control of Sharpe, who had assembled a staff of 30-50 scouts and support personnel to run the military intelligence operation of the Army of the Potomac. He later supported Grant&#x2019;s Armies Operating Against Richmond (AOAR) during the Siege of Petersburg, where the BMI played a fundamental role in the victory.<br><br>His career did not end in 1865. Sharpe crossed paths with almost everyone prominent in America after the Civil War. He became one of the most powerful Republican politicians in New York State, had close friendships with Presidents Grant and Arthur, and was a champion of African-American Civil rights.<br><br>With the discovery of the day-by-day journal of John C. Babcock, Sharpe&#x2019;s civilian deputy and order-of-battle analyst in late 1963, and the unpublished Hooker papers, the military correspondence of Joseph Hooker during his time as a commander of the Army of the Potomac, Tsouras has discovered a unique window into the flow of intelligence reporting which gives a new perspective in the study of military operations in the U.S. Civil War.</p><p>Peter Tsouras is a retired analyst of military all-source intelligence for the U.S. Government (National Ground Intelligence Center and the Defense Intelligence Agency). He is also a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve and has written 30 books on military history and alternate military history as a military historian and biographer.&#x201c;The author is to be commended for documenting the life of George H. Sharpe, and his special talent for producing actionable intelligence that had a direct effect on the outcome of the Civil War.&#x201d; (<i>Civil War News</i>)<br><br>"Peter Tsouras's exhaustive research to piece together an account of Sharpe's wartime career should prompt historians to examine other important military-intelligence operations in the Civil War." (<i>Michigan War Studies Review</i>)<br><br>"Peter Tsouras' work on George H. Sharpe, intelligence-officer extraordinaire of the Army of the Potomac, resurrects the career of perhaps the Civil War's most consequential staff officer. [...] Using a staggering number of official and unofficial sources, the author reconstructs the career of each prominent BMI member in greater detail than any previous historian. As a result, readers get to know these men and appreciate their tremendous effect in shaping the storied battles of the Army of the Potomac." (<i>The Civil War Monitor</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;There are scouts and spies, daring escapes, codebreakers, even order-of-battle analysts, and brief profiles of many men and women who had some role in gathering, organizing, and synthesizing reams of information that Sharpe used to help his commanders &#x2013; Joe Hooker, then George G. Meade, and finally U.S. Grant &#x2013; make better decisions, assuming they accepted his analysis. An outstanding work for anyone interested in the Civil War or the craft of intelligence.&#x201d; (<i>The NYMAS Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Spanning beyond just his role in the Civil War, and taken in-part from the journal of Sharpe&#x2019;s analyst John C. Babcock, this biography also details Sharpe&#x2019;s time in politics&#x2014;including his friendships with Presidents Grant and Arthur and his support of African-American Civil Rights.&#x201d; (<i>The Archive</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This volume, then, is an absolute treasure trove of much previously overlooked historical and operational information on what can rightly be described as the birth of American military intelligence and psychological operations.&#x201d; (<i>Military History Magazine</i>)<br><br>"This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the &#x201c;story behind the story&#x201d; of Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Overland Campaign, and the other great battles of the Eastern Theater of the Civil War from 1863 onward."

Jo Beverley passed away in May 2016.Chapter One<br><p>Summer 1816. North of London</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still as a statue in the full moon&#x2019;s light the highwayman watched the road. He controlled his mount without effort and without bit, and when the horse stirred, tossing its head, no jingle broke the quiet of the night woods.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His clothing was dark as the shadows, his face concealed behind a black mask and a delicate beard and mustache in the style of Charles I. He would be invisible if not for the splash of a sweeping white plume on his broad Cavalier hat.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That plume was the signature of Le Corbeau, the bold French rascal who called himself the Crow and claimed the right to peck at those who traveled the night roads north from London.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though no one else was could be seen, the Crow did not fly alone. He had men stationed north and south to warn of danger and of approaching prey. He waited for their signals in stillness except for the stirring of his feather in the breeze.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, at last, an owl hoot with a strange pattern at the end floated from the south. A victim approached. A suitable one. Not the well-armed mail coach or poor pickings on a swaybacked horse or in a cart. What came from the south was undefended but worth the effort, and would be here soon.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He listened until he heard the pounding of fast horses. With a sharp whistle of his own, he surged out of the trees and down the road head-on to the coach and pair.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The startled coachman dragged on his reins. By the time the coach stopped, Tristan Tregallows, Duke of St. Raven, commanded the two people in the coach with his cocked pistol, and two colleagues kept guard nearby.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart pounding in a way both alarming and pleasurable, Tris thought this was almost as good as sex. Pity this was his first and last night for the game.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<b>Monsieur, madame</b>,&#x201d; he greeted with a slight inclination of his head. He continued in the French-accented English of the real Le Corbeau. &#x201c;Pleeze to step out of ze carriage.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he spoke, he assessed his victims as best he could, given the dim interior.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perfect.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terror or threatened apoplexy might have driven him off, but he had a fashionable young couple at gunpoint. The lady sat closest to his side of the coach, and she seemed more furious than frightened. Her mouth was set, and her direct, pale eyes showed outrage at his attack.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Damn your eyes, you gallows bait!&#x201d; the man snarled. The voice confirmed him well-born, which was excellent. He would not miss half his money.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Zat is in ze hands of <b>le Bon Dieu</b> and ze magistrates, <b>monsieur</b>. You, on ze other hand, are in mine. <b>Sortez!</b> You know my reputation. I will neither kill you nor take your all&#x2014;unless,&#x201d; Tris added, trying for silky menace, &#x201c;you continue to disobey me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, get out and let&#x2019;s get this over with,&#x201d; ordered the man, shoving the woman so hard that she banged against the inside of the coach.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her head snapped toward her partner as if she&#x2019;d blister him, but then she turned back to open the door, head bowed, apparently meek as milk.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Tris backed Caesar a few steps to make sure he couldn&#x2019;t be jumped, his mind danced with curiosity. The man was a cur. It seemed the woman might think the same, yet she obeyed. It could be an unhappy marriage, but such wives rarely rebelled over little things.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tried to shut off curiosity. He didn&#x2019;t have time for a mystery. Even so late, on a night with a good moon another vehicle could appear at any time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman climbed down the steps, one hand holding her pale skirt out of the way, the other using the open door for balance. Half an eye on the man, St. Raven still made a number of instant assessments.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She tended to roundness rather than slender elegance.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was graceful in this awkward situation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was dressed in a fine evening gown under a light shawl. Unusual for traveling. Damn. Perhaps they were called away to a deathbed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had a neat ankle.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she arrived on the road and looked up at him, he noted a heart-shaped face fringed with dark curls frothing out along the front edge of a fashionable evening turban of striped cloth. She wore pearls at her neck and ears.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modest pearls, however. He wished she showed signs of fabulous wealth. He supposed he&#x2019;d have to take them, or at least part of them. Damnation. Would returning them destroy the purpose of this enterprise?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned his full attention to the stocky man who followed her. His top boots, breeches, jacket, and beaver hat might seem casual to some, but Tris recognized the height of fashion for a certain sort&#x2014;a sporting Corinthian. The striped waistcoat, the flamboyant cravat, and the cut of the coat confirmed it and sent a warning: The man&#x2019;s heavy build would be all muscle.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the moon shone full on the man&#x2019;s sneering face&#x2014;chunky, wide in the jaw, and with a nose that looked to have been broken more than once.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crofton.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viscount Crofton, a man in his early thirties of moderate wealth and expensive tastes, especially in women. Or rather, in quantity of women. He was a bruising rider and pugilist who was generally to be found at any event promising sport&#x2014;with men or women&#x2014;and with a preference for the rough.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crofton had attended a gentlemen&#x2019;s party at Tris&#x2019;s house once. It had been made clear that he would never be welcome again. It would be a personal pleasure to distress Crofton, but the man was dangerous, and needed watching.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tris reminded himself not to be distracted, but some detail niggled. Something that might be relevant here.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He brushed it aside. He had a simple task in hand&#x2014;to stage a holdup so that the man in jail as Le Corbeau would be proved innocent.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Your purses, pleeze,&#x201d; he said, but couldn&#x2019;t resist another glance at the woman. Crofton wasn&#x2019;t married, but dress, demeanor, and jewelry spoke of a lady, not a whore. Did he have a sister?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crofton pulled a handful of banknotes out of his pocket and tossed them onto the ground, where they fluttered in the breeze. &#x201c;Grovel for them like the pig you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Crow,&#x201d; Tris corrected, tempted to force the man to pick them up with his teeth. <i>&#x201c;Madame?&#x201d;</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I have no purse.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cool, educated voice. A lady for sure, and the moonlight painted her features with white marble purity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Then it will have to be your earrings, <b>che[aarie</b>.&#x201d; Instinct clamored that something was wrong, and he couldn&#x2019;t ride away with this mystery unsolved. The thought of a well-bred lady in Crofton&#x2019;s clutches revolted him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced at the woman, but she wasn&#x2019;t looking at him. She was gazing at the moonlit countryside, denying his existence even as she took the pearl drops from her ears and tossed them down by the money.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she looked at him, eyes narrowed, lips tight. The mysterious lady wasn&#x2019;t frightened. She was furious.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had to be with Crofton by choice to be so angry at the interruption. On the other hand, he couldn&#x2019;t forget the way Crofton had shoved her and her instinctive, outraged reaction.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, the elusive detail came to him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A week or two ago, Crofton had won a property in a game of cards. Stokeley Manor in Cambridgeshire. To celebrate, he was throwing a party&#x2014;an orgy, to be precise. Tris had received a presumptuous invitation, and unless he was mistaken, the event began tomorrow night.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Crofton was on his way there, and he wouldn&#x2019;t be taking his sister with him, or any other respectable lady. Unlikely as it seemed, the moonlit madonna had to be a high-priced whore. Not all whores were sluts, and some used a ladylike appearance as part of their stock-in-trade.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience and instinct, however, told Tris that this woman was no such thing. There was one way to try her out.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Le Corbeau was a foolish, romantic sort of highwayman, and he sometimes offered to return his loot for a kiss. A lot could be learned from the way a woman kissed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tris smiled at her. &#x201c;Since my wages have so unfortunately fallen in ze dirt, <b>ma belle</b>, I must ask you to pick zem up for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought she was going to refuse. The moonlight did not show color, but he knew a flush of anger heated those rounded cheeks&#x2014;anger that tightened, her lips and confirmed his fears. It was the sort of cold, righteous anger no whore he&#x2019;d known would ever permit herself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Do it,&#x201d; Crofton snapped, &#x201c;and get rid of the cur.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She flinched under the order, but again she submitted, walking forward and then dipping down to pick up the money and earrings. She didn&#x2019;t walk like a whore, either.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tris didn&#x2019;t like it. He didn&#x2019;t like it at all.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;d heard that Crofton&#x2019;s entertainments leaned to the crude and that he had a taste for debauching virgins&#x2014;the less willing, the better. Might he have found a way to force a well-bred virgin to be the centerpiece of his celebration?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman straightened and approached the horse, holding out the money and jewelry.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked down into steady, despising eyes. Who the devil did she think she was? Joan of Arc? She was on her way to an orgy with Crofton, and she&#x2019;d be wiser to be looking for help than treating a possible rescuer like a slug.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He moved Caesar forward a step. The woman flinched back, her stony composure breaking for a moment. Afraid of horses? When her lips relaxed, however, they showed a temptingly full bow. Kissing her wouldn&#x2019;t be any sacrifice at all.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He remembered to check on Crofton. Damn stupid to have been distracted. The man seemed to be simply observing, amused. A bad sign. Tris moved Caesar forward another step, and again she backed away.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;If you keep retreating, <b>che[aarie</b><i>,</i> we will be here all night.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her lips tightened again. &#x201c;Good. Then someone will come along and arrest you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not in time. Ze money?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She set her chin and stepped forward, holding the money and earrings up and out, coming no closer than she had to. The contrast between her bravado and her obvious fear of Caesar touched his heart.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the loot, and she hastily backed away. He separated the banknotes roughly in half and tossed part back on the ground. &#x201c;I beggar no man.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crofton laughed. &#x201c;That amount wouldn&#x2019;t beggar me, cur. Are we done, then?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tris looked at the woman again. &#x201c;I will return ze rest and your earrings for a kiss, <b>che[aarie</b>.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took another step back, but Crofton pushed her forward. &#x201c;Go on, <b>Cherry</b><i>,</i> kiss him. I&#x2019;ll let you keep the blunt if it&#x2019;s a good one.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tris saw her inhale a long, angry breath, sensed fire behind her eyes, but again she did not protest. What hold did Crofton have over her?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;If I must,&#x201d; she replied so coldly that he felt he should shiver. He suppressed a grin. He liked her spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He extended his gloved hand. &#x201c;I cannot risk dismo...</p></p><h2>St Mihiel 1918: The American Expeditionary Forces&#x2019; trial by fire (Campaign)</h2><p>The St Mihiel salient had been formed in 1914 as the Germans drove towards Paris at the beginning of World War I (1914-1918). The French had attempted to recapture it in 1915 without success and in 1916 the Germans used the area as a base to attack Verdun. The bitter battle for Verdun had cost hundreds of thousands of German and French casualties. After the Germans called off their attack of&nbsp;the salient, the war shifted north, leaving the salient protruding ominously into the Allied lines. Despite holding the salient since 1914, after the losses of early 1918, Ludendorff reluctantly decided to abandon the area and retire to a heavily fortified line at the base of the salient. The evacuation was ordered to begin on September 8, 1918. This was to be the scene for the newly formed American Army's first major offensive of the war. This highly illustrated and detailed account will highlight every aspect of this important campaign.</p><p>David Bonk is a lifelong student of military history and historical miniatures wargamer.

She is a passionate photographer, an avid tennis player, a drop-all-when-they-call mom and Grammi, and a confidante to friends of all stripes. </p>Run-of-the-mill divorce drama from a veteran author (Shades of Grace, 1996, etc.), this featuring the owner of a wicker-furniture chain who's betrayed by her husband but adored by someone much cuter. With a business to run, two kids to see to, and a dying mother, Boston businesswoman Claire Raphael has too much on her mind to notice that her husband, Dennis, a failed venture capitalist, has been exhibiting symptoms of restlessness and envy. Dennis does capture her attention, though, when Claire returns from a business trip to find the kids gone and a summons server waiting on her doorstep. It appears that Claire is being sued for divorce and has been removed from her house and separated from her children by court order on the grounds that by working too hard and having an affair with her CEO she's an unfit mother. Readers might feel sorry for the unjustly accused Claire if she didn't feel so monumentally sorry for herself. Declaring that ``wanting it all'' doesn't make her an evil person, she flees weeping into the arms of said CEO--incidentally her husband's former college roommate, and a handsome hunk with a house on the shore besides--and, while accepting a warm, tingly but emphatically platonic hug from him (photographed through the window, natch, by her jealous husband), decides that she won't take Dennis's false accusations lying down. Enlisting the aid of a lawyer, Claire starts digging up the dirt on Dennis, while simultaneously buying, refurbishing, and furnishing a charming old lighthouse to live in (this takes only one day, so organized is she), dealing with her daughter's allergies and her son's emotional withdrawal when Dennis proves incompetentas a psychological helper, and, just for fun, indulging after all in that affair with her CEO before she brings her former husband to his knees. Therapeutic, perhaps, for readers in the throes of their own divorces, but too formulaic for others. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The watercolors contribute verve as characters dash around the pages in their efforts to help Rachel. By varying the perspectives, Priceman enhances the story's energy; the book perfectly captures the pacing and hilarity of jump-rope rhymes and tongue twisters.

It witnessed the rise of the great European powers, the beginnings of modern science and the myriad inventions that changed age-old ways of life. It saw Copernicus and Newton, Harvey and Galileo, Bacon and Descartes. During its course, the New World was settled and the Old reshaped. <p>Seventeenth-century France saw the application of the new spirit of exploration and analysis to matters of the soul. Pierre de B�rulle, John Eudes, Jean-Jacques Olier and Mother Madeleine de Saint-Joseph left an indelible mark on the history of Christian spirituality in the West. Much of our current understanding of "spirituality" had its beginnings with these authors. </p><p>In his penetrating and probing introduction, Professor William M. Thompson presents the French school as a creative response to the challenge of the modern age that dawned with the seventeenth century. He shows how these authors created a "science of the saints" that blended metaphysical speculations with flights of mystical love. Their fascination with the intersection between human and divine experience unlocked for them the true meaning of humanity and focused their attention on the mystery of the Incarnation as a sublime mystery of adoration and service. </p><p>This volume is a comprehensive introduction to the spirituality of seventeenth-century France, containing, among others, selections from B�rulle's Discourse on the State and Grandeurs of Jesus, Madeleine de Saint-Joseph's Spiritual Letters, Jean-Jacques Olier's Introduction to the Christian Life and Virtues, and John Eudes's The Life and Kingdom of Jesus in Christian Souls.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French, Latin</p><h2>Fireside (The Lakeshore Chronicles)</h2><p><br><br>Baseball hopeful Bo Crutcher is about to get his shot at the majors.

When people saw someone in dark glasses on a cloudy day in the middle of winter, they assumed the wearer was hiding the fact that she'd been drinking, crying or fighting. Or all of the above.<br><br>Under any number of circumstances, Kimberly van Dorn enjoyed being the center of attention. Last night, when she'd donned her couture gown with its scandalous slit up the side, turning heads had been the whole idea. She'd had no idea the evening would implode the way it had. How could she?<br><br>Now, at the end of a soul-flattening red-eye flight, she kept her shades on as the plane touched down and taxied to the Jetway. Coach. She never flew coach. Last night, however, first class had been sold out, personal comfort had taken a backseat to expediency, and she'd found herself in seat 29-E in the middle of the middle section of the plane, wedged between strangers. Sometimes the need to get away was more powerful than the need for legroom. Although her stiff legs this morning might argue that point.<br><br>Who the hell had designed coach class, anyway? She was convinced she had the imprint of her seatmate's ear on her shoulder. After his fourth beer, he kept falling asleep, his head lolling onto her. What was worse than a man with a lolling head?<br><br>A man with a lolling head and beer breath, she thought grimly, trying to shake off the torturous transcontinental night. But the memories lingered like the ache in her legs&#x2014;the lolling guy with a snoring problem, and, on her other side, an impossibly chatty older gentleman, who talked for hours about his insomnia. And his bursitis. And his lousy son-in-law, his fondness for fried sweet potatoes and his dislike of the Jude Law movie Kim was pretending to watch in hopes of getting him to shut up.<br><br>No wonder she never flew coach. Yet the nightmare flight was not the worst thing that had happened to her lately. Far from it.<br><br>She stood in the aisle, waiting for the twenty-eight rows ahead of her to deplane. The process seemed endless as people rummaged in the overhead bins, gathering their things while talking on mobile phones.<br><br>She took out her phone, thumb hovering over the power button. She really ought to call her mother, let her know she was coming home. Not now, though, she thought, putting the phone away. She was too exhausted to make any sense. Besides, for all she knew, the thing had one of those tracking features, and she didn't feel like being tracked.<br><br>Now that she'd arrived, she wasn't in such a big hurry. In fact, she was utterly unprepared to face a dreary midwinter morning in New York. Ignoring the stares of other passengers, she tried to act as though traveling in an evening gown was a routine occurrence for her, and hoped people would just assume she was a victim of lost luggage.<br><br>If only it could be that simple.<br><br>Shuffling along the narrow aisle of the coach section, she definitely <em>felt</em> like a victim. In more ways than one.<br><br>She left behind a scattering of sequins in the aisle. There was a reason clothes like this were designated as "evening wear." The silk charmeuse dress, encrusted with sequins, was meant to be worn in the romantic semidarkness of a candlelit private club or Southern California garden, lit by tiki torches. Not in the broad, unforgiving daylight of a Saturday morning.<br><br>It was funny, she thought, how even a couture gown from Shantung on Rodeo Drive managed to look tawdry in the morning light. Especially when combined with a side slit, bare legs and peep-toe spike heels with a crisscross ankle strap. Only last night, every detail had whispered <em>class.</em> Now her outfit screamed <em>hooker.</em> No wonder she was getting funny looks.<br><br>But last night, in the middle of everything, Kim hadn't been thinking about the morning. She'd just been thinking about getting away. It seemed as though a million years had passed since then, since she'd dressed so carefully, so filled with hope and optimism. Lloyd Johnson, star of the Lakers and the biggest client of the PR firm she worked for, was at the pinnacle of his career.<br><br>More importantly for Kimberly, he'd found his dream house in Manhattan Beach. They planned to live there together. It was supposed to be her night, a moment of triumph, maybe even a life-changing occasion if Lloyd had decided to pop the question. Well, it had been life-changing, just not in the way she'd anticipated. She had sunk everything she had into her career as a sports publicist. And overnight, that had crumbled. She was Jerry Maguire without the triumphant ending.<br><br>She finally reached the front of the aircraft, murmuring a thank-you to the flight attendants as she passed. It wasn't their fault the flight had been so miserable, and they'd been up all night, too. Then, just as she stepped onto the Jetway, the security doors opened and a ground-crew guy in a jumpsuit and earphones blew in on a gust of frigid wind.<br><br>The arctic air slapped her like a physical assault, tearing at the silk dress and skimming over her bare legs. She gasped aloud and gathered a fringed wrap&#x2014;the only outerwear she had&#x2014;around her bare shoulders, clutching it in one fist, her jewelencrusted peacock evening bag in the other.<br><br>Sweet, merciful Lord. She had forgotten this&#x2014;the East Coast cold that simply had no rival anywhere in California. She grabbed her long red hair but was too late. It had already been blown into a terrifying bouffant, and she was fairly sure she'd lost an earring. Lovely.<br><br>Holding her head high, she emerged from the Jet-way and entered the terminal, walking at a normal, unhurried pace, though she wanted to collapse. The red-soled Louboutins with their three-inch heels, which had looked so fabulous with the single-shoulder sheath, now felt hideous on her feet.<br><br>Silently cursing the couture shoes and clutching the silk wrap around her, she scanned the concourse for an open shop to buy something to wear on the last leg of the trip, to the town of Avalon up in the Catskills, where her mother now lived. Last night, there had been no time to grab anything, even if she <em>had</em> been thinking straight. She'd made the flight with moments to spare.<br><br>To her dismay, all the kiosks and shops along the way were still closed; never had she craved a pair of flip-flops and an I V NY T-shirt more. It was a long walk to the commuter concourse, especially in these heels.<br><br>She passed people in warm winter clothes, probably heading up to the mountains for a weekend of fun. She pretended not to notice the looks of speculation, the comments whispered behind snugly gloved hands. Ordinarily, other people's opinions were her first concern. But not today. She was too tired to care what people were saying about her.<br><br>Across the way stood a guy, leaning with his foot propped against the wall, staring at her. Okay, so a lot of guys were staring at her, since she was dressed like an escapee from a Hooters convention. He was easily six foot five and had long hair, and he wore cargo pants and an army surplus parka with wolf fur around the hood.<br><br>She was an idiot for not being able to ignore him. Men were her downfall; she should know better. And&#x2014;please, Lord, no&#x2014;with a leisurely air, he pushed away from the wall and seemed to be ambling toward her. Kim had never been much of a student of literature, but as he advanced on her, she found herself remembering a phrase coined by Dorothy Parker&#x2014;<em>What fresh hell is this?</em><br><br>More quickly than was prudent in the skinny heels, she headed for the moving walkway, wishing it could be a magic carpet, whisking her away from her troubles. She stepped aboard&#x2014;and felt one of her heels sink down between the grooves of the walkway. Gritting her teeth, she tried to tug her foot free. As she did so, the other heel sank into another groove.<br><br>And just when she thought the day could not get any worse, it did.<br><br></p><h2>The Banker&#39;s Wife</h2><p><b>A <i>USA Today </i>Bestseller<br><br>"Immersive, satisfying, tense--and timely: This is probably happening for real right now."--Lee Child<br><br>"First-rate...Slick, heart-hammering entertainment."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>On an early morning in November, a couple boards a private plane bound for Geneva, flying into a storm. Soon after, it simply drops off the radar, and its wreckage is later uncovered in the Alps. Among the disappeared is Matthew Werner, a banking insider at Swiss United, a powerful offshore bank. His young widow, Annabel, is left grappling with the secrets he left behind, including an encrypted laptop and a shady client list. As she begins a desperate search for answers, she determines that Matthew's death was no accident, and that she is now in the crosshairs of his powerful enemies. <br><br>Meanwhile, ambitious society journalist Marina Tourneau has finally landed at the top. Now that she's engaged to Grant Ellis, she will stop writing about powerful families and finally be a part of one. Her entry into the upper echelons of New York's social scene is more appealing than any article could ever be, but, after the death of her mentor, she agrees to dig into one more story. While looking into Swiss United, Marina uncovers information that implicates some of the most powerful men in the financial world, including a few who are too close to home. The story could also be the answer to Annabel's heartbreaking search--if Marina chooses to publish it. <br><br><i>The Banker's Wife </i>is both a high-stakes thriller and an inside look at the personal lives in the intriguing world of finance, introducing Cristina Alger as a powerful new voice in the genre.</p><p><b>Cristina Alger </b>is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Darlings</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>This Was Not the Plan</i>. A graduate of Harvard College and NYU Law School, she worked as a financial analyst and a corporate attorney before becoming a writer. She lives in New York with her husband and children.Marina<br><br>Marina stood on the balcony of her suite at Le Meurice and looked out at the glistening lights of Paris. The view was spectacular, particularly at night. To the west, the Eiffel Tower and Roue de Paris stood illuminated against the night sky. Across the rue de Rivoli, les Jardin des Tuileries glowed, as if lit from within. Marina considered waking up her fianc&#x17d;, Grant, so he could enjoy the view with her. But there would be time for that. Their trip had just begun. Instead, Marina sat down at the table. She sparked a cigarette, inhaled. It felt good to have no work to do, no functions to attend, no emails begging response. She could read a book. She could do her nails. She could do nothing at all. The night was hers. Here in Paris, it was just beginning.<br><br>Her phone rang, jarring her. Marina felt a prick of irritation when she saw who was calling.<br><br>"Duncan," she said, her voice curt. "It's past midnight here."<br><br>"Were you sleeping?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"I didn't think so. You're still on New York time. You don't sleep, anyway."<br><br>"That doesn't mean you're allowed to call me during my first vacation in almost ten years."<br><br>"I need you to do something for me."<br><br>Marina cringed. This was exactly the reason that Grant wanted her to leave Press magazine. In the near decade she'd worked for Duncan, she'd never once taken a vacation. She worked most weekends, countless holidays. She answered her phone at all hours of the night. She had begun her career as Duncan's assistant. Now, nine and a half years later, despite her senior status on the magazine masthead, he still occasionally treated her as such. Twenty-four hours into this trip, and already, he was tasking her with something. It was unbelievable, really, though not entirely surprising.<br><br>Marina intended to quit. She'd promised Grant she would, right after the wedding. The rumors that Grant's father, James Ellis, was going to run for president were true. The campaign would move into high gear in a matter of weeks. He had already assembled a team of campaign advisors and publicists. He would need it. A hotheaded billionaire from New York, he wasn't exactly the people's candidate. But once the spin doctors had done their magic, James Ellis would be transformed into a hardworking success story, a professional deal maker, a fresh alternative to the presumed Democratic nominee-and consummate DC insider-Senator Hayden Murphy. Murphy, who had been dogged for years by rumors of corruption and cronyism, was a formidable but flawed candidate. Ellis knew this; he was banking on it.<br><br>Quietly, Marina had her doubts that her future father-in-law was fit to be the leader of the free world. She'd seen him lose his temper at the smallest of errors: at a new housekeeper who stocked the wrong kind of bottled water at the Southampton house, for example, or at a driver who missed the turnoff for Teterboro Airport-but she also knew that Grant was a calming influence on his father. Grant would resign from his investment banking job and take over the family business while his father was out on the campaign trail. In his new capacity as president of Ellis Enterprises, Grant would travel constantly, and he would expect Marina to accompany him. There were things one had to do as the wife of a CEO of a multinational corporation. Not to mention the wife of the president's son, should it come to that. She couldn't work and be Mrs. Grant Ellis. At least, not at the same time. There was no question what was more important to her. She had to quit. That was part of the deal, and on some level, she'd always known it.<br><br>For a moment, Marina considered quitting right then, over the phone. It was justified, certainly. People at Press quit all the time. Duncan was a famously difficult editor in chief, and he paid his staff below the paltry industry standard. But it didn't feel right. After everything Duncan had done for her-and everything they'd done together-she wanted to resign the right way: in person, at a time that made sense not just for her, but for the magazine, too.<br><br>"You're unbelievable," Marina said. She stubbed out her cigarette and slipped back inside to find a pencil. "Aren't you supposed to be on a sabbatical?"<br><br>Duncan didn't answer the question. The topic of his sabbatical was a sore one. It was not something he had agreed to voluntarily. Rather, it was mandated by Philip Brancusi, the CEO of Press's parent company, who insisted that Duncan use the six weeks to dry out, once and for all. The drinking had become a problem, and everyone in publishing knew it. Everyone except Duncan himself.<br><br>"Are you writing this down?" he said.<br><br>"Of course I am."<br><br>"I need you to meet someone. He's coming from Luxembourg to meet with you, and I don't know how long he'll be free, so make yourself available. He's going to give you a USB to bring to me. Be very careful with it. And tell no one."<br><br>"What am I supposed to say to Grant?"<br><br>"Who's Grant?"<br><br>"You're joking."<br><br>"Tell him you're going for a run. Or you need to meet an old friend. He's a big boy. He'll survive without you for forty-five minutes." Duncan sounded irritated, which irritated Marina. She scribbled the information so furiously on a hotel notepad that the tip of her pencil snapped.<br><br>"Damn it," she muttered, and reached for a pen.<br><br>"Look, I know you're frustrated," Duncan said. "I know what I'm asking is annoying. But it's important, Marina. This material is highly sensitive. My source doesn't trust email, even encrypted email. He wants to hand over the data directly. I was going to fly to Geneva last week to meet him myself, but I believe I'm being followed."<br><br>Marina stifled an eyeroll. "By who?"<br><br>Duncan ignored her. "I told him you're the only person I trust."<br><br>"Stop buttering me up, Duncan. I suppose I don't get to know what this is about?"<br><br>Duncan paused. In the background, Marina could hear what sounded like a snowplow. She wondered if Duncan was out of the city, holed up at his weekend house, where he was beginning to spend more and more of his time. She worried about him out there. He drank too much and socialized too little. When Duncan drank, he became dramatic and paranoid. When he got dramatic and paranoid, he usually called Marina.<br><br>"We'll talk when you're back," he said. "But, Marina . . . this is it. After all these years, I think we finally found him."<br><br>Marina stopped writing. "Him?"<br><br>"Morty Reiss."<br><br>"Alive?"<br><br>"Very much so."<br><br>Marina paused, absorbing the enormity of what Duncan was saying. It had been eight years since Morty Reiss's suicide. Almost to the day. Or rather, it had been eight years since Morty Reiss's car was found on the Tappan Zee Bridge, a suicide note taped to the windshield. Days after his alleged suicide, Morty's hedge fund, RCM, was uncovered as one of the largest Ponzi schemes of all time. Reiss saw the writing on the wall and jumped, or so the story went. His body, however, was never found. At the beginning, Marina and Duncan harbored the same suspicion as many: that Reiss faked his own death and disappeared with his ill-gotten gains to some sun-washed country without an extradition treaty. Of all the people Marina had written stories about during her tenure at Press magazine, Reiss was perhaps the smartest, most ruthless con man she'd ever come across. Given that Marina wrote about New York society figures-Wall Street tycoons, real estate magnates, fashion designers, publicists-that was saying a lot. If anyone was smart enough to disappear along with his money, it was Reiss.<br><br>Reiss was brilliant-as brilliant as they come-but eventually all Ponzi schemes necessarily come to an end, and that was the one thing that had always niggled at Marina about the RCM story. Insider trading, embezzlement: anyone could get away with these crimes if they were clever enough. Just steal the money and ride off into the sunset. But Ponzi schemes require an unending supply of investors. Without new investors, the whole scheme collapses like a house of cards. So why would Reiss opt into a crime with no end? He seemed too smart for that. That is, unless he'd planned on faking his death all along.<br><br>If that was the case, Marina had to hand it to him: Reiss was potentially the most cunning financial criminal of all time.<br><br>As the years passed with no news or trace of Reiss, however, Marina's disbelief faded slowly into acceptance. Was it really possible for a man like Reiss-whose face flashed across television screens worldwide for months on end-to disappear? Marina didn't think so. It seemed too far-fetched-fantastical, even. A Hollywood plotline instead of a real news story. Reiss was smart, but he was also human. Perhaps his greed or hubris did end up getting the better of him, she thought.<br><br>While Marina's interest with Morty Reiss waned, Duncan Sander's blossomed into a full-blown obsession. After he and Marina cowrote the original expos&#x17d; of RCM, Duncan went on to pen several more pieces about Reiss and his coconspirator, Carter Darling. His theories about Reiss's whereabouts became outlandish and unsubstantiated, and Marina feared that Duncan's fixation had irreparably damaged his reputation as a serious journalist. Six months ago, it had almost cost him his career. On a morning talk show, Duncan claimed Reiss had hundreds of millions stashed in an account at Caribbean International Bank in the Cayman Islands. US authorities looked the other way, Duncan claimed, because a ring of high-profile politicians, who also happened to have millions stashed away in numbered accounts, were protecting the bank. The interview caused a sensation, not only because of what Duncan said, but how he said it. His slurred speech and sweaty, unkempt appearance did not go unnoticed by viewers. Soon, there were rumors that Duncan Sander was headed for a public meltdown. Caribbean International Bank threatened to sue not only Duncan, but Press and its parent company, Merchant Publications. Under pressure from CEO Brancusi, Duncan issued a hasty retraction. Then he made a show of heading to a rehab facility in northern Connecticut, where he spent a few weeks drying out and nursing his ego. As far as Marina could tell, rehab hadn't helped much with Duncan's drinking. It bought him a reprieve at Press, however, and Duncan had returned to work a month later.<br><br>Now he was on his second attempt at rehab, and Marina knew it was the last chance with Brancusi. He had given Duncan an ultimatum: dry out for good and come back ready to work, or don't come back at all. Duncan couldn't afford another misstep. One more lapse in judgment, and Brancusi would have his head.<br><br>"Duncan, can you prove this? You'll need to. We can't have another-" Marina stopped short, not wanting to finish that sentence. Duncan did not like being reminded of the interview, or his drinking problem, or frankly any mistake he'd ever made, ever. They'd never spoken of it, except in the vaguest of references.<br><br>"I can, this time. He's got more than seventy million at Swiss United."<br><br>Marina wrote down Swiss United and underlined it. "Swiss United. So not at Caribbean International," she said, trying not to sound skeptical.<br><br>"No, that's the thing. It was there. I was right about that. And he moved it. Just before I gave that interview."<br><br>"And you can prove this. You have account records and everything."<br><br>"My source does. Marina, this is the story of our careers."<br><br>Marina jumped when she felt a hand on her shoulder. Behind her stood Grant, looking sheepish.<br><br>"Hi," he whispered. "I didn't mean to scare you."<br><br>"I've got to go," Marina said to Duncan. "We'll talk later."<br><br>"Is Grant there?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Okay. I'll call you tomorrow when I have the details about the drop."<br><br>"Fine. Good night, Duncan."<br><br>"Sorry," Grant said, kissing Marina on the head as she put down the phone. "I heard your voice and hoped you were ordering room service. I'm starving."<br><br>Marina laughed. "I wasn't, but I can. What do you want?"<br><br>"Let's look." Grant reached over her and picked the room service menu off the desk.<br><br>"Who were you talking to?" he asked as he perused the menu.<br><br>"Duncan."<br><br>"What did he want?"<br><br>Marina shrugged. "He's working on a story. Wanted me to help."<br><br>Grant put down the menu. "I hope you said no."<br><br>"Of course I did."<br><br>"Isn't he supposed to be in rehab?"<br><br>"Sabbatical."<br><br>"Whatever. It's totally inappropriate for him to call you in the middle of the night during your vacation."<br><br>"I think he was just excited about the story."<br><br>Grant shook his head. "Don't defend him. I hate the way he treats you. He has no boundaries, Marina."<br><br>Marina sighed. "I know. He frustrates me, too. But you have to understand: Duncan is the reason I'm a journalist. When I started at Press, I honestly just wanted to work at a fashion magazine because I thought it sounded cool. I thought I'd go to great parties and try on couture clothes and meet interesting people. But Duncan saw something more in me. And he expected more from me. When we worked on the story about the Darlings, he treated me like his colleague instead of his twenty-two-year-old assistant. He really let me run with it. And when it was over, he listed me as his cowriter. So yes, he drives me insane sometimes. A lot of the time. But I also owe him my career. And for that I'll always be grateful to him."<br><br>Grant reached for Marina's hand. They interlaced their fingers and smiled at each other. "I'm sorry," he said. "I'm just protective of you."<br><br>"And I think you're very sweet."<br><br>Grant cocked one eyebrow. "And sexy?"<br><br>"Very sexy."<br><br>"Is it sexy if I order myself a double bacon cheeseburger with fries now?"<br><br>"Incredibly."<br><br>"It won't be here for at least thirty minutes. Care to join me in the bedroom while I wait for my midnight snack?"<br><br>"I'd be delighted. Order me fries, too, all right? I'm an only child. I don't share well."<br><br>"I don't, either. So promise me something."<br><br>"Anything." Marina wrapped her arms around Grant's neck and smiled up at him.<br><br>"Promise I won't have to share you on this trip. It's just a few days. I want us to unplug and enjoy each other."<br><br>Marina nodded. "Mm-hmm," she said. She reached up for a kiss. She felt Grant's hands on her backside and suddenly she was in the air, her legs wrapped around his waist. "I promise," she murmured, as he carried her back to the bedroom.</p><h2>The Diaries of Nella Last: Writing in War and Peace</h2><p><p>"Her account records the personal adjustments that trickle into daily life amid sweeping international change."&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>This collection brings together into a single volume the best of Nella Last's prolific outpourings, including a great deal of new, unpublished material from the war years.

It is time to repay the debt, and Shchepkin&#x2019;s bosses in Moscow are not the forgiving types.

He lives in Guildford, England14 December 1943<br><br>This night train was not like the one that had brought her to Berlin all those years ago. You could walk down that train, stare out of the wide corridor windows, move from carriage to carriage, eat dinner in one set up as a restaurant. This train was just a series of self-contained rooms, each with a pair of long seats and two doors to the outside world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Their room had been full when they left Berlin. There were herself and Leon, two elderly men wearing old-fashioned collars, a woman and her almost grown-up daughter, and two Hitlerjugend on their way home from their annual convention. Baldur von Schirach himself had presented the medals they&#x2019;d won in a Reich-wide orienteering contest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So far their papers had only been checked the once, during the long stop at Frankfurt an der Oder. Two drenched officials had come in from the pelting rain, dripped on all the proffered documents, and grumbled their way back again. Hers had survived a dozen inspections in Berlin, but she had still been worried that her face would betray her, that these people really did have a sixth sense when it came to Jews. Sitting back relieved, as the train pulled away, she told herself that she was simply falling for their propaganda, for the lie that Jews were somehow intrinsically different. Her father had always denied this&#x2014;human beings were human beings, he had always claimed, no matter what faith they chose. The trouble was, he would usually add, some of them didn&#x2019;t know it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The two Hitlerjugend had seemed like nice enough boys. They had admired Leon&#x2019;s tinplate engine, and tried to teach him noughts and crosses. The boy had certainly enjoyed the attention, his eyes wistfully following them when they disappeared down the darkened platform at Glogau. The mother and daughter had also got off there, leaving the two old men to sit behind their newspapers and smoke their foul-smelling cigarettes. &#x2018;Victory at Vitebsk!&#x2019; ran the headline on one, just three words for the whole front page. She wondered how Breslau had fared&#x2014;would it be as bad as Berlin?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She read to Leon as quietly as she could, aware that even this was irritating the two old men, but reminding herself of Sophie Wilden&#x2019;s oft-repeated advice&#x2014;&#x2018;the more submissive you are, the more they&#x2019;ll wonder why.&#x2019; When the old men got off at Liegnitz she breathed a sigh of relief&#x2014;now perhaps she and Leon could lie down and get some sleep. But then, with the whistle already blowing, the door jerked open and a man climbed in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was in his forties, she guessed. Quite burly, with a weak chin and gold-rimmed glasses. He was wearing a black uniform, but not that one&#x2014;there were no lightning flashes, only a number on the epaulettes and two stripes on the arms. She could smell the alcohol on his breath and see the animal in his eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was affable enough at first. He tried to talk to Leon, in much the same way the Hitlerjugend had done. But there was nothing genuine in it. Leon was only three, but even he could tell something was wrong, and soon his face was creased with anxiety, the way it had been after the Wildens&#x2019; house was bombed. And the man kept looking up at her, as if for approval, the glances soon slipping from her face to her breasts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I think he should get some sleep,&#x2019; she said, trying to sound firm but not aggressive.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Of course,&#x2019; the man said, leaning back in his corner seat. He took out a silver flask and took a swig. She could feel his eyes on her as she covered Leon with the small blanket she&#x2019;d brought for that purpose.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Are you all right, Mama?&#x2019; the boy asked. He was having trouble keeping his eyes open.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Of course I am. Now you get some sleep, and I will too.&#x2019; She kissed him on the head and went back to her corner seat. It was furthest she could get from the man, but perhaps she should haven taken Leon&#x2019;s head in her lap&#x2014;she couldn&#x2019;t decide.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Where is the boy&#x2019;s father?&#x2019; the man asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;He was killed at Stalingrad,&#x2019; she said automatically. It was the story she always told, and true as far as Leon knew. But telling it this time had been a mistake&#x2014;Leon was asleep, and she could have claimed a living protector, one who was waiting on the platform at Breslau. Someone powerful like an SS officer, someone to make this<br>man think twice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x2019; he said, with a palpable lack of sincerity. He took another swig, then offered her the flask.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She politely declined.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;This belonged to a Russian once,&#x2019; he went on, waving the flask.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;One I killed. Perhaps I avenged your husband&#x2014;who knows?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Are you still in the Army?&#x2019; she asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No, I work for the General Government in Galicia. We are clearing lands for German settlement,&#x2019; he explained peevishly, as if someone had challenged his usefulness. &#x2018;Your husband, what was his occupation?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;He was the manager of a department store,&#x2019; she decided, thinking of Torsten.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;You must miss him,&#x2019; he said abruptly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;My husband? Of course.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;The closeness. The human touch.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I have my son,&#x2019; she said shortly. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s been nice talking to you, but now I think I must get some sleep. We have much to do in Breslau tomorrow.&#x2019; He nodded but said nothing, just took another swig and stared out into the darkness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps he would let her be, she thought; perhaps he&#x2019;d drink himself to sleep. She closed her eyes, ears alert for any sound of movement. She thought she could feel his stare, but maybe it was just imagination. It wasn&#x2019;t as if she was a great beauty. She felt weary to the bone herself. It would be so wonderful to fall asleep and wake up in Breslau...<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn&#x2019;t know how long she was out, but she woke with a start to feel an arm around her neck, a hand roughly squeezing her breast, and waves of schnapps-heavy breath gusting over her face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t make a fuss,&#x2019; he said, his arm tightening its grip around her neck. The bulge of an erection was straining at his trousers. Most of her wanted to scream, to twist and writhe and bite and claw, but she&#x2019;d had six years to steel herself against this moment, to<br>carve out the composure she would need to thwart the next rapist. &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t make a fuss,&#x2019; she whispered, and was amazed at the steadiness of her own voice. She brushed a finger along the bulge, fighting back nausea. &#x2018;If you let me up, I&#x2019;ll take off my blouse.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled out his arm from behind her neck, and started undoing<br>his belt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She got to her feet and, standing with her back to him, began unbuttoning the blouse. Leon was fast asleep, his tinplate engine wedged between him and the back of the seat. She&#x2019;d have just one chance, she thought, and her knees felt weak at the thought. She reached forward to rearrange the boy&#x2019;s blanket, picked up the engine as if moving it out of his way, then turned and crashed it into the man&#x2019;s face, shattering his glasses and drawing a spurt of blood from his forehead. A gasp of agony came out of his throat as his hands reached up to his eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She stood there for a second, suddenly uncertain, but the moment he tried to rise she hit him again, this time on the side of the head, and down he went between the seats, his head and shoulders against the door.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was unconscious, maybe even dead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Leon, she saw, had slept through it all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Steeling herself, she stood astride the man&#x2019;s legs and tugged at his armpits until his upper back was also against the door. Then, kneeling on the corner seat, she depressed the door handle until the door sprang open. Head and shoulders dropped into a curtain of rain, but the rest showed no sign of following them out, until she crawled back along the seat, got behind his feet, and started pushing with all her might. For several long moments nothing seemed to move, and then with a rush the body was gone. It took her longer still to pull the door shut, and the bang when she did was loud enough to wake the boy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Mama?&#x2019; he said anxiously.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;It&#x2019;s nothing,&#x2019; she said quickly, sitting beside him and stroking his hair. &#x2018;Go back to sleep.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He reached up an arm but obediently closed his eyes. Tomorrow she would need an explanation, she realised. Not for the man, who might have got off, but for the damage to his favourite toy.<br><br><b>The Men From Moscow</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; John Russell reached across and rubbed the tea shop window with his sleeve to get a better view of what was happening on the pavement outside. A middle-aged man in uniform was hectoring two boys of around twelve, jabbing his finger at first one and then the other to emphasise his indignation. The boys wore suitably downcast expressions, but one was still clutching a fearsome-looking catapult behind his back. Once the adult had run out of useful advice and stalked haughtily away, the two youngsters raced off in the opposite direction, giggling fit to bust. Russell somehow doubted that they had seen the error of their ways.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He took another sip of the still-scalding tea, and went back to his <i>News Chronicle</i>. Like most of the newspapers, it was filled with evidence of Britain&#x2019;s newly split personality. While half the writers explored, with varying degrees of eagerness, the socialist future<br>promised by the new Labour government, the other half was busily lamenting those myriad challenges to Empire that the war&#x2019;s end had conjured into being. Palestine, Java, India, Egypt... the outbreaks of violent disaffection seemed never-ending, and thoroughly inconvenient. The British press, like the British public, might want a new world at home, but they were in no mood to relinquish the old one abroad.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The sports page was still full of the Moscow Dynamo tour, which had begun so inauspiciously the previous weekend. A fellow-journalist had told Russell the story of the Football Association reception committee&#x2019;s dash to Croydon Airport, and the subsequent<br>rush back across London when it transpired that the Russians&#x2019; plane was about to land at Northolt. The FA&#x2019;s choice of Wellington Barracks as a hotel had gone down badly with the tourists, particularly when their arrival coincided with the drilling of a punishment detail. Several of the Soviet players had concluded that they were being imprisoned, and had refused to leave their bus. It seemed as if things had improved since then&#x2014;yesterday the visitors had been taken to the White City dog-track, where only the Magic Eye photo<br>machine had denied them a rouble-earning win.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Russell looked at his watch&#x2014;as usual, Effi was late. Clearing a new patch in the condensation he could see the queue outside the cinema already receding up Park Street. He gulped down the rest of his tea and went to join it, hurrying to beat the crowd pouring off a pair of trolleybuses. The visibility on Camden High Street was worse than it had been twenty minutes earlier, and the air seemed twice as cold and damp.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Several people in the queue were stamping their feet and clapping their hands, but most seemed in surprisingly high spirits. Only six months had passed since the end of the war in Europe, and perhaps the novelty of peace had not quite worn off. Or maybe they were just happy to be out of their overcrowded houses. Russell hoped they weren&#x2019;t expecting an uplift from the film they were about to see, which the same journalist friend had warned him was a sure-fire wrist-slitter. But then Effi had chosen it, and it was her turn. She still hadn&#x2019;t forgiven him for West of the Pecos.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The queue was beginning to move. He looked at his watch again, and felt the first stirrings of anxiety&#x2014;Effi&#x2019;s English was improving, but still a long way from fluent, and frustration always seemed to render her German accent even more pronounced. Locals with grudges had no way of knowing that she was a heroine of the anti-Nazi resistance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was almost at the door when she appeared at his side. &#x2018;The trolleybus broke down,&#x2019; she explained in German, leaving Russell conscious of the sudden silence around them.<br>She noticed it too. &#x2018;I have to walk half way,&#x2019; she added in English. &#x2018;How is your day?&#x2019; she asked, taking his arm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Not so bad,&#x2019; he said, with what had lately become his usual lack of candour. Was she just as reluctant to share her worries with him, he wondered. When they had found each other again in April, after more than three years apart, everything had seemed just like before, but slowly, over the succeeding weeks and months, a gap had opened up. Not a large one, but a gap all the same. He was often aware of it, and knew that she was too. But try to talk about it, as they had on several occasions, and all they ended up doing was re-state the problem.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Solly has a couple of ideas he&#x2019;s looking into,&#x2019; he told her, forbearing to add that his agent had seemed even less hopeful than usual. Since the San Francisco Chronicle had dispensed with his services in May, Russell had returned to freelancing, but pieces sold had been few and far between, and he sometimes wondered whether he was on some unknown blacklist. He had done enough to warrant inclusion on such a list, but as far as he knew no one else was aware of that fact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And money was decidedly short, he thought, counting out the three shillings and sixpence for their tickets. Effi and her sister Zarah were earning a little from their needlework, but Paul&#x2019;s job with Solly was their only regular source of income. It was all a far cry from their affluent life in pre-war Germany.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; They found two seats in the centre of the back stalls and watched the auditorium slowly fill. For Effi, such moments always brought back memories of her years alone in Berlin, when a darkened cinema was the only place she could meet with her sister. And she was also reminded of evenings with Russell, watching herself up there on the screen, back when she&#x2019;d been a famous actress. It seemed several lifetimes ago, but lately she&#x2019;d found herself missing the stage, and wondering if she would ever act again. Not here, of course, not with her English, but back in Germany? Several theatres had already re-opened in Berlin, and sooner or later her country would start making films again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It would probably be later, she thought, as the Path� News camera panned across the ruins of her home town. The streets seemed clearer than they had in April, but nothing much else seemed changed. There were no signs of new construction, only military jeeps and haggard-looking women weaving their way through a maze of perforated masonry. British servicemen looked up from their lunches to grin at the camera, but she doubted whether the locals were eating so well.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The &#x2018;B&#x2019; movie had London policemen successfully rounding up a gang of black market spivs, something they seemed incapable of doing in real life. Russell missed the name of the film being trailed, but it involved a man and a woman sharing meaningful expressions in a railway station buffet, and looked likely to end in tears.

Choosing a formal name for a child was no small matter: it required the weighing of tradition and precedent. <p></p>My surname, Ye, means Leaf. My generation name, Xing&#x2014;Capable&#x2014;had been decreed by my paternal grandfather after casting bamboo fortune telling sticks in the family ancestral hall, so all Father&#x2019;s children were called Xing. My three older siblings Father had named after characteristics he admired; my brothers were Upright and Steadfast, my sister Diligent. For me he chose Ting, a homonym that means Graceful in writing but sounds like Stop when heard. <p></p>The word magic didn&#x2019;t work. A year and a half later my sister Maple was born, Mother&#x2019;s fifth and last child. <p></p>Normally, June was the beginning of the rainy season, a time of year hated by most people in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. There was usually a solid month of drizzle and extreme humidity. Green mould grew on walls and floors; dampness seeped into people&#x2019;s bones. On the rare days when the sun appeared, courtyards and sidewalks were festooned with clothing, bedding and furniture. Everyone dreamt of living in a "zipper-roofed building." <p></p>As Great-Aunt never tired of telling anyone who would listen, my coming into the world was unlucky, a girl born in the year of the dragon.1 She also said I was destined to lead a hard and unpredictable life, since June 1952 was uncharacteristically hot and dry, a sure sign of the King Dragon&#x2019;s disapproval, for he was the God of Rain. King Dragon, she said, dwelt in a crystal palace at the bottom of the Eastern Sea, where he was surrounded by crab generals and an army of shrimps, all of them male. I was often tempted to ask who did the household chores if there were no females like Grandmother, Mother <p></p>1.Although we called her Great-Aunt, she was not a blood relation. She had been taken into my grandfather Ye&#x2019;s household as an unpaid live-in maid when in her twenties, after being twice widowed. When my father set up his home in Shanghai, Great-Aunt was sent along to keep house for him. <p></p>&#x2014; <p></p>A week after my birth, Mother brought me home from the Red House Hospital, so named because red paint covered its brick walls, wooden window-frames and doors, to my family&#x2019;s three-room apartment in the centre of the city. Shaded by plane trees, Wuding (Valiant Tranquillity) Road ran east and west through the former International Settlement and many <i>long-tang</i> &#x2014;lanes, some as wide as two cars side by side, some only shoulder width&#x2014;connected with it, forming a densely populated yet quiet neighbourhood. Shanghai itself, only ten miles wide and ten miles long, was inhabited by about six million people. We lived in Zi Yang Li&#x2014;Purple Sunshine Lane. <p></p>Our two-story brick building was a traditional Shanghai-style house, built in a square U-shape around a courtyard or "sky-well" that served as the front entrance. Two black-lacquer doors, heavy and tall, with brass door-knockers shaped like dragon heads with rings through their noses, guarded the courtyard. Residents used the back door, however, reserving the front for occasions such as weddings and funerals. <p></p>In all, eight families lived in six apartments, three at each level. Two water taps in the tiny corridor at the back served all the families, and their use was strictly regulated and policed by our neighbour, Granny Ningbo. The upper tap, with its brick sink, could be used only to wash food, clothing and dishes. The lower one was for cleaning chamber pots and rinsing mops. On each floor, one small kitchen served four families. From the roof terrace I could see the chimney of the Zheng Tai Rubber Shoe Factory, which my father owned. <p></p>Where Purple Sunshine Lane intersected with Wuding Road was the <i>cai chang</i> &#x2014;food market. Its rough plank stalls stretched about thirty yards along both sides of the shady street. The centre of our neighbourhood, it opened at six o&#x2019;clock in the morning, but lineups for popular food like pork bones and fat, which were cheaper and required fewer ration coupons, began to form hours earlier. Some residents would get out of bed early, take up spots near the front of the line, then sell them for a few cents. By early afternoon the market was closed, and the residents used the empty stalls to make quilts on or to air their bedding. <p></p>For several years the sky-well, the lane and the busy market were my world. <p></p>&#x2014; <p></p>One day when I was four years old, my father came home from the factory with a big red silk flower pinned to the lapel of his Western-style jacket. Even at that age I knew that wearing a red flower, real or not, meant praise and honour. But Father didn&#x2019;t look happy about his prize. He limped past me, tossing the flower on the dinner table, and closed the bedroom door behind him. I stared longingly at the red blossom. From inside the bedroom, I heard Father and Mother talking. Only then did I realize that Father had come home early. All my older siblings were still in school and two-year-old Number 5 was having a nap. <p></p>Mother came out of the room and saw me eyeing the flower. She said I could have it so long as I kept quiet. She helped me pin it to my jacket and I rushed joyfully downstairs to the sky-well, sporting my colourful reward. I didn&#x2019;t know that Father had been given the flower for surrendering his factory&#x2014;the enterprise his grandfather had established and he had operated for almost twenty years&#x2014;to the government. In return, he was to receive a ridiculously meagre compensation of cash and bonds, paid in installments over seven years.2 <p></p>Father was kept on as "private representative" to run the factory he used to own. But when he insisted on claiming his compensation, he was labelled a "hard-minded capitalist" who, the government said, could be reformed only through hard physical labour. Thus, before I turned five, my father had fallen from a respected and prosperous business owner to a labourer. <p></p>2.In 1956 the government began its nationalization program: the forced confiscation of all private businesses. <p></p>Even though I was too young to understand the momentous changes that worried Mother, Father and Great-Aunt, I was old enough to notice certain changes. Father no longer wore his Western-style jacket and tie. Instead he put on a dark blue or black worker&#x2019;s jacket buttoned up to the neck. Despite his physical disability&#x2014;a childhood attack of meningitis had crippled him in one leg and he had to walk with a cane&#x2014;he was assigned to one of the most menial jobs in the factory, pushing a heavy wooden cart loaded with rubber shoe uppers between workshops. It was the humiliation and deep wound to his pride that led him to make a decision that turned to tragedy. <p></p>One morning in April 1959, Father left home to go to work as usual. It was the last time I saw him walk. Later that day, Mother was called to a district hospital, where she learned that without telling anyone in the family Father had undergone surgery to cure his limp. The operation had been botched and Father was paralyzed from the waist down. Mother was horrified to see Father&#x2019;s entire torso wrapped in bandages that hid a wide scar from the base of his neck to his pelvis. After three years of suffering, confined to his bed, he passed away at the age of forty-one. I was nine. <p></p>Left with five kids and no job, my mother took me time after time on her visits to the factory, where she begged the officials to cash some of the bonds Father had been given when the factory was expropriated. The family had no income now, she argued, and her children were hungry. Her pleas and my tears had no effect. The bonds could not be redeemed for many years, Mother was reminded. <p></p>In order to feed her family, Mother had to face the fact that one of my brothers, seventeen and fifteen at the time, would have to quit school and find a job. One day in May 1963, a year after Father&#x2019;s death, Mother once again took me with her to the factory. She asked the director to take one of her sons on as an apprentice to help ease her burden and support the family. If there was any way she could have avoided coming to him for help, she said, weeping harder, she wouldn&#x2019;t be sitting there begging him. An hour later, we were sent away without an answer. <p></p>For weeks the atmosphere at home was so tense that I could almost touch it with my fingertips: tense because my brothers were forced to make a decision neither of them wanted; tense because the factory director might turn down Mother&#x2019;s pleas. Finally the answer came: the Rubber Industry Department would take Number 1 on, not in Father&#x2019;s factory, but in one that specialized in melting and refining raw rubber. <p></p>Mother was relieved but worried. She had wanted her son to work in Father&#x2019;s former factory because it was nearby. Most of the workers there knew our family and she hoped that they would look after her son. An added complication was that, although the director had specified a position for my eldest brother, Number 1 and Number 2 had decided differently. None of us knew how they had come to the conclusion that Number 2 was to be the one to quit school so that Number 1, who was one year short of qualifying to sit for university exams, could continue his education. My father had always wanted both of his sons to go to university. Since no one in the new factory knew my family, Number 2 pretended to be Number 1, and by the time the director found out, Number 2 had turned sixteen and was already a skillful worker. <p></p>So by the time I was twelve, my family had been on welfare for years. Where I had once sported a silk coat covered with a cotton smock, I now wore my brother&#x2019;s hand-me-downs. And when I passed up and down our lane, the residents, in particular the members of the neighbourhood committee,3 suspicious that my "capitalist" mother had secret income, would stop me and lift up my jacket to make sure I wasn&#x2019;t wearing good clothing hidden underneath. When I became nearsighted, Mother ignored my pleas for prescription glasses because she couldn&#x2019;t afford to buy me a pair. Instead she gave me a pair Number 2 had outgrown. They caused me constant headaches, and I put them on only when necessary. <p></p>However, my personality had grown far from the modest and passive Chinese female praised by tradition. In defending myself and my family&#x2019;s name and, at times, fighting <p></p>3.The neighbourhood committee is the lowest level of government organization. It puts government regulations into effect at "street level," for example, distribution of food and coal coupons, or administration of welfare payments. <p></p>Excerpted from My Name is Number 4 by Ting-xing Ye. <p></p>Copyright � 2006, 2008 by Ting-xing Ye. <p></p>Published in 2008 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press <p></p>All rights reserved.

Includes illustrations.<br><br>As worship leaders struggle to keep (or make) worship alive and meaningful, they are compelled to study the biblical teaching on the subject. They could do no better than turn to Andrew Hill's robust contribution.<br><br>Hill contends that the Old Testament has much to teach New Testament believers about worship--by theological principle if not by explicit example and direct application. With exceptional care and thoroughness, Hill explores the multifaceted aspects related to worship in the Old Testament. These include worship's form and function, place and piety, arts and actions.<br><br>In a review in <i>Presbyterion</i>, Robert Yarbrough of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School had this to say about the author's study: "Hill provides solid review of Old Testament history as it relates to development of worship views and styles. He interweaves questions, concerns, and insights, however, that are distinctly modern, making his book engrossing rather than dry reading."<br><br>This book, explains Hill, should be regarded as one ingredient necessary to concoct a serum for worship renewal in the church. Indeed, the Old Testament has much to teach us about worship. While the needs of individual churches differ, all approaches to worship renewal must be comprehensive enough to consider the biblical, historical, and theological sources of Christian worship.</p><p>Andrew E. Hill is associate professor of Old Testament at Wheaton College. He commented on Song of Solomon and Obadiah in the <i>Evangelical Commentary on the Bible,</i> compiled <i>Baker's Handbook of Bible Lists,</i> and coauthored <i>A Survey of the Old Testament</i>.

Rescued by the king's druids from almost certain death, he learns the arts of healing and song, and the mystical ways of a secretive order whose teachings tantalize with hints at a deeper wisdom. Yet young Succat Morgannwg cannot rest until he sheds the strangling yoke of slavery and returns to his homeland across the sea.

Many of those who survive the attack are rounded up and carried back to Ireland. </p><p>Among the survivors is a 16-year-old boy named Succat--the impulsive and willful young scion of a British noble family--who is sold in the slave market to a merciless ruler. When Succat is gravely punished after a foiled attempt to escape, he comes to the attention of Cormac, a novice Druid eager to practice his healing skills. Succat learns to respect the Druid's lore and love of learning and is given a new name, Patrick, the Celtic word for nobleman. </p><p>What follows is the story of Patrick's missing years--years of calamity, defeat, and crushing disappointment that form him into a bard and advisor to the High King of Ireland, and lead to the mission for which his name will be remembered throughout history.</p><p>Stephen R.

But with friends like his, life is never going to be that uninteresting.</p><p>Chica Umino is the creator of <b><i>Honey and Clover,</i></b> which debuted in 2000 and received the Kodansha Manga Award in 2003. <b><i>Honey and Clover</i></b> was also nominated for the Tezuka Culture Prize and an award from the Japan Media Arts Festival.Grade 9 Up&#x2013;With translations scheduled through volume four (December, 2008), this series seems here to stay. In this first volume, Takemoto, a college art student in Tokyo, takes center stage and provides the main perspective. He lives the life of a starving artist and student, looking quite like a character from <i>Chibi Vampire</i> (TokyoPop) whenever he has the opportunity to eat meat. Takemoto lives with several other male students, including the illusive Morita, who frequently takes off on a whim, returning days or weeks later with interesting treats (usually involving meat) and then crashing for a minimum of 48 hours. The first chapter sets the scene for the remainder of the book, with Morita's oddities introduced and all the boys meeting tiny, beautiful Hagu, an art prodigy who catches the interest and attention of everyone she meets. Morita, though, takes special exception and begins to exploit Hagu through a Web site he creates, marketing her as a koropokkur, a member of a mythical race of tiny people. Throughout the story, the characters go about their daily lives, attending to class, trying to get enough to eat, and falling in love with the wrong people. Umino's graphics are simple, and the characters are typical of shojo manga in that they are prone to frequent fits and hysterics. Though the sexual innuendos are tame, the college setting and complex love connections make this a better fit for high school readers.<i>&#x2013;Sarah Krygier, Solano County Library, Fairfield, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His white-maned, mustachioed image is instantly identifiable throughout the world, the very picture of probity and high spirits (which explains why he's become the poster boy for products as diverse as beer, billiard tables, sewing machines, pizza, and real estate). Perhaps more importantly, Twain's books have retained all their power to amuse and enrage. How is it possible for the creator of a 19th-century "boy's holiday book" (Twain's own description of <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>) to raise so many contemporary hackles? The answer is that Twain <i>is</i> a contemporary writer. Not, of course, from a chronological point of view--he was born in Missouri in 1835 and died in 1910 (having insisted that "annihilation has no terrors for me"). But Twain was the first writer to elevate the American vernacular to a high art. Sidestepping the starched-shirt diction of his peers, he created an idiom that resembled (but did not precisely duplicate) the wayward, slangy, ungrammatical music of American conversation. No serious reader of Twain will want to do without the <i>Oxford Mark Twain</i>. This 29-volume leviathan includes not only the major works but also a treasure trove of essays and short pieces, many of them unavailable for decades. Throw in the introductions to each volume (by such heavyweights as Toni Morrison, Kurt Vonnegut, Cynthia Ozick, Gore Vidal, George Plimpton, Bobbie Ann Mason, and Walter Mosley), as well as the original illustrations, and you've got the book bargain of the millennium.In "A Tramp Abroad, Mark Twain's unofficial sequel to "The Innocents Abroad, the author records his hilarious and diverse observations and insights while on a fifteen-month walking trip through Central Europe and the Alps. "Here you have Twain's inimitable mix," writes Dave Eggers in his Introduction, "of the folksy and the effortlessly erudite, his unshakable good sense and his legendary wit, his knack for the easy relation of a perfect anecdote, and some achingly beautiful nature writing." <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic reproduces the text of the first American edition and features new explanatory notes and a critical Afterword by Kerry Driscoll, professor of English at Saint Joseph College in Connecticut.</p><h2>on Location.....on Martha&#39;s Vineyard (the making of the movie Jaws)</h2><p>Title: On Location.....on Martha's Vineyard( (The Making of the Movie "Jaws")) &lt;&gt;Binding: Paperback &lt;&gt;Author: EdithBlake &lt;&gt;Publisher: BunchofGrapesBookstore,Inc.</p><p></p><h2>Body Full of Stars: Female Rage and My Passage into Motherhood</h2><p><b>"In this honest memoir, May recounts how she came to feel connected with her body again.

Maybe it's just me? Is it just who I am? It isn't you and it is you. It is an energy you are meeting&#x2015;maybe for the first time, maybe for the thousandth time but now in new way. It has a message. It wants to tell you something important. But the last thing you want to do is listen. You want out. Get me the hell out. And if you can't get out, you want it gone, exiled, extracted from your essence. However, that's the basic Physics 101 truth about energy. It cannot be destroyed. You <i>are</i> responsible for how you manage it. But you aren't necessarily it. You are in relationship with it. It can only be heard and, then, with great love (and energy of your own), rerouted.</p> ~ Labor<br><br> ____________________________________ <p>We walk a long slow walk in late April.</p> <p>"I wonder what the wind is bringing," I say.</p> <p>"Who knows?" Chris answers and grabs my hand.</p> <p>Snow edges around tamped down grass. Small green buds have begun to surface. The wind almost blows my straw hat away. I have told my midwife the moon affects my cycles. It was just full. But she says first babies often come two weeks late.</p> <p>We'll see.</p> <p>Because it is five days before my due date and I can feel the new mother-me nearby. She speaks to me already. She will walk through the forest for hours with her newborn tucked against her breast. As years unfold, she will pass on some necessary truths: cross many borders, language matters, don't forget to talk to your own body. Maybe motherhood will give her a reason to become a great human. We duck down under some trees and I lurch back down the hill, one hand on my belly, one hand on Chris' shoulder. A few weeks ago, at my yearly haircut, the same two-inch trim because I've never adventured much with my brown locks or my dress or my physical presentation, I told my sleeve-tattooed hairdresser that my husband had started to go gray, a remarkable even blend with his dark and she said, "Well, what you've got on your hands now is a salt-and-pepper fox."</p> <p>And she's right, only he is, of course, more than that.</p> <p>We've been together for thirteen years and, despite our recent murky distance, he still does it for me on all levels. When we reach flat ground, a great blue whale urge to rest comes over me. I curl up on the bed. Chris stays outdoors in the wintery mix of spring and rearranges rocks from our garden into a pile for a different garden. I've canceled all my plans for the next few days. My friends near and far know I've entered what I call the cave. My mother walks in from her house next door to her guesthouse, where we are living, and smiles at me like the Mother Mary. We are all waiting.</p> <p>"How are you, sweetheart?" she asks.</p> <p>"Good, slow, ready. But this babe might wait until May."</p> <p>"We'll see," she says, "I'm making a smoothie, would you like some?"</p> <p>"Sure," I say, "Thanks," and watch my graceful mother walk out the door. She lived halfway across the world, away from her community, when she gave birth to me. As afternoon sun streaks through the window, I scroll through boy names on the phone. Hard to find one we like. We never had an ultrasound but my intuition knows this babe is a boy. Maybe we'll never get to use the girl name we chose. When I glance out the window and whisper it aloud anyway, my bladder calls out.</p> <p>Pee now. I barrel roll off the bed and stand up. It's hard to remember what it felt like to once inhabit a non-pregnant body. Pop. Water starts to spill from between my legs. It is clear but pale green somehow. I freeze, as if any more movement will cause a baby to drop from between my legs. Drums pound in my chest. What do I do now? My mother walks back in with my tiger dog Bru.</p> <p>"I think my water just broke," I stutter.</p> <p>"Looks like it," she says and winks and for a long moment we look down, a long pause, even Bru investigates. She has told me what her mother told her. My body will know what to do. It is a natural process. I've spent most my life in an intense conversation with my body&#x2015;this will be one more part of that. </p> <p>Water broke.</p> <p>Water broke.</p> <p>Water broken.</p> <p>What does that even mean?</p> <p>We stare as it pools on the concrete floor.</p> ~ <p>I come from brothers' so do my mother, my father, my husband, his mother, and his father. We only have brothers. There are no sisters and no girls, other than the ones who brought the boys into the world. I didn't care about the sex of my baby. Even so I dreamt of my son riding in a lime green backpack, and of losing him, leaving him somewhere and the panic. Did he know what a crazy lady his mother had become while he was in utero? At six weeks pregnant, I had perched on a chair in the office of my doctor and friend Holcomb.</p> <p>"How do you feel?any nausea?" she asked.</p> <p>"Not a bit. I feel great, excited," I beamed as my hand fluttered over a flat belly. My mother only had one whiff of nausea during her three pregnancies, so the forecast looked good for me. The next week, my stomach turned. I began to vomit into toilets, mason jars while driving, bushes behind the hardware store, kitchen bowls, snow and my own lap. Multiple times a day. None of this is unusual. But it didn't go away after the first trimester. It tapered but stayed my whole pregnancy. My baby was grown on chicken, whole milk yogurt and oatmeal. I ate nothing green. I took no prenatal vitamins. I pressed my face into grass to get away from offending smells: toast, coffee, forest fires. Holcomb was also pregnant, a month behind me. Her nausea never shifted into vomiting. She explained she had to hold it down, just <i>could not</i> let that lid off.</p> <p>But my lid had blown off.</p> <p>Part of me knew it was an initiation&#x2015;to what though, I wasn't sure yet.</p> <p>Even daily body maintenance became impossible. I stopped brushing my hair or wearing sunscreen. Someone told me metal near my body was bad so I cut one underwire out of my bra, forgot about the other one and walked around with uneven breasts for months without realizing it. My exuberance about life would kick in from time to time. I'd always been able to get up and try again. But then something would backfire, like moving too fast too wide and long on cross-country skis and ending up at a chiropractor's office with seized muscles and ligaments around my pelvis.</p> <p>It was a mild case of hyperemesis.</p> <p>That would have been the rational explanation. But I sat on my perpetual life question: had I created this situation? Acid in my throat must be an act of releasing the old. It was necessary for my growth. I could also no longer censor what words came out of my mouth, except when teaching writing workshops in town. Somehow my sickness never showed up in front of my adult students or clients. Maybe I could control it then because I had control there. We had entered a co-habitation of sorts with my parents two months into my pregnancy when they moved permanently to their small cabin on this wild stretch of land in Montana. Chris and I had made a home here for two years in our own yurt until the cold and throwing up off the porch in the middle of the night got difficult. I needed the bathroom of the cabin. Their guesthouse was a garage, not yet a guesthouse. I wanted to welcome them to <i>their</i> land and then leave to rent a place nearby. But we couldn't both rent and save for the future home Chris would start to build soon on a triangle of land a thousand feet down the driveway. No bank would give a loan to a self-employed artist couple. My parents had been generous in letting us stay.</p> <p>But the close quarters grated on everyone, especially me.</p> <p>We slept on their couches, folding up and stashing blankets every morning. We shared the one small bathroom with them. Intergenerational. People used to live this way. Many people still do. It could be a healthy support system. It could also be thunderstorms after thunderstorms. It was probably both.</p> <p>A viper awoke in me.</p> <p>Call it rage. Call it fury. I wasn't unfamiliar with the emotion. It's a part of every human, but never before had it come on in and taken over. Everyone safe enough to be close annoyed me. I lashed out with mean comments. I apologized as much as much I vomited. They watched me scream at the moon. They backed away slowly. Chris and I happened to be in the middle of an uncomfortable changing of the tides. We avoided each other or stewed. No one saw me whack the ground repeatedly with a long metal spoon. Friends told me to feel the feelings. Really? But my rage turned inward as well. How could I be so cruel to the people supporting me? I'd never been a placid human, always slightly impatient, but these maneuvers were new. I was losing opportunities all over the place. My disappointment at not being a radiant pregnant woman was a small part of it. My mother would later say, "You were radiant at times. You just couldn't see it." She would remind me there has always been a good and kind Molly and point out I had lost control of some basics all at once&#x2015;my shelter, my adulthood, my marriage, my mode of transportation, and my body. There <i>are</i> photos of me with my arms around Chris, with a wide smile and gleam in my eyes, with my hands wrapped around the gorgeous largess of my body. Toward the end, a softening occurred. It has too when you can only waddle. I would stand on a snowy bridge, tap my belly and feel a small kick respond back.</p> <p>"Hey there, sweets."</p> <p>My babe was already my purifier.</p> <p>My body, despite the throwing up, had stayed strong through the pregnancy&#x2015;no swollen ankles, no blood pressure spike, no low iron, no infections, no complications at all. I held onto this luck of mine. It was my ticket back to decency. I had clawed my way through a strange passage toward motherhood. Part of me destroyed by it; part of me fortified. On the other end, we would meet our dear child, eventually move into our house and my body would no longer be stuck in a state of shock. With that, I would let go of all rage and settle back into the woman I knew myself to actually be.</p> <p>But it was my, our, backstory.</p> <p>It's hard to erase the backstory. </p></p><h2>Ripples in Spacetime: Einstein, Gravitational Waves, and the Future of Astronomy</h2><p>&#34;The detection of gravitational waves - ripples in spacetime - by the Ligo-Virgo observatories has already been called the scientific coup of this century and lead to the scientists responsible being awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics.

It conveys a sense of awe about a century of scientific investment and achievement and a sense of excitement for what&#x2019;s to come.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard O&#x2019;Shaughnessy</b><b>, </b><b><i>Physics Today</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Schilling gives us a lively and readable account of the [gravitational] waves&#x2019; discovery... Schilling underlines that this discovery is the opening of a new window on the universe, the beginning of a new branch of science. Astronomers will no longer be limited to observing space through the waves of electricity and magnetism (for example, visible light) entering telescopes, but will be able to observe it through waves of gravity. Galileo would have been amazed.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Graham Farmelo</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A detailed account of the quest to detect gravitational waves.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Ryerson</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Ripples in Spacetime</i> provides a comprehensive and approachable guide to a complex subject.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Monica Young</b><b>, </b><b><i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[<i>Ripples in Spacetime</i>] explains complex ideas clearly and entertainingly...It details the personalities, rivalries, collaborations, controversies, setbacks and successes of the century-long quest to test Einstein&#x2019;s theories. Bang up to date, the book describes science in progress and as a process: how ideas are developed and discoveries made and rejected or confirmed. The best part for me was the detail the book goes into about the first detection and the meticulous protocols in place to scrutinize and eliminate every possible error. Schilling also looks ahead to what we can expect in this whole new field of astronomy. This is a book for everyone who was as excited as I was when the [Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory] discovery first broke, but also for anyone who wants to know what all the fuss was about.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jenny Winder</b><b>, </b><b><i>BBC Sky at Night Magazine</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In September 2015, a new frontier in astronomy beckoned with the first direct detection of gravitational waves, confirming Albert Einstein's prediction almost a century before.

The early universe was opaque to radiation until 380,000 years after the Big Bang, but gravity waves poured out from almost the beginning, so a new field of &#x2018;gravitational wave astronomy&#x2019; can look back almost to the birth of the cosmos.

This campaign had been undertaken by the Commander-in-Chief Bomber Command, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, and was baptized &#x201c;The Battle of Berlin&#x201d;. </p><p> The Berlin campaign was a hard, desperate slog. Struggling against dreadful and bitter winter weather, Bomber Command &#x201c;went&#x201d; to Berlin a total of sixteen times, suffering increasingly severe losses throughout the winter of 1943/44 in the face of a revitalized German air-defense. The campaign remains controversial and the jury, even today, is ultimately undecided as to what it realistically achieved. Illustrated throughout with full-color artwork depicting the enormous scale of the campaign, this is the story of the RAF's much debated attempt to win the war through bombing alone.</p></p><p>Dr Richard Worrall teaches at the Department of History, Politics &amp; Philosophy at Manchester Metropolitan University, and has taught history for over ten years, most recently in Singapore, and previously at the London School of Economics and Manchester Metropolitan University.

Aren't you?" These famous lines from <i>The Graduate</i> (1967) would forever link Anne Bancroft (1931&#x2013;2005) to the groundbreaking film and confirm her status as a movie icon. Along with her portrayal of Annie Sullivan in the stage and film drama <i>The Miracle Worker</i>, this role was a highlight of a career that spanned a half-century and brought Bancroft an Oscar, two Tonys, and two Emmy awards.<br><br>In the first biography to cover the entire scope of Bancroft's life and career, Douglass K. Daniel brings together interviews with dozens of her friends and colleagues, never-before-published family photos, and material from film and theater archives to present a portrait of an artist who raised the standards of acting for all those who followed. Daniel reveals how, from a young age, Bancroft was committed to challenging herself and strengthening her craft. Her talent (and good timing) led to a breakthrough role in <i>Two for the Seesaw, </i>which made her a Broadway star overnight. The role of Helen Keller's devoted teacher in the stage version of <i>The Miracle Worker </i>would follow, and Bancroft also starred in the movie adaption of the play, which earned her an Academy Award. She went on to appear in dozens of film, theater, and television productions, including several movies directed or produced by her husband, Mel Brooks.<br><i><br>Anne Bancroft: A Life</i> offers new insights into the life and career of a determined actress who left an indelible mark on the film industry while remaining true to her art.</p><p><b>Douglass K.

The thick stone and clay walls of the former pioneer fort trapped warmth like a kiln, and the small, stoutly barred window providing the only ventilation opened out almost directly onto the row of latrines at one side of the prison&#x2019;s central courtyard.<br><br>Fort Helena. Hell on earth for those unfortunates imprisoned within by the country&#x2019;s despotic regime.<br><br>A bearded man sat statue-like in one dirty corner of the gloomy cell; his stillness partly because of the cloying heat, and partly because each movement brought pain. He had been delivered to the prison a day earlier, and as a welcoming gift given a beating by a group of guards before being taken to a dark room where a grinning man had provided him with a hands-on demonstration of some of the numerous instruments of torture at his disposal. Just a sample, he had been promised. A full show would soon follow.<br><br>Someone else was in the torture chamber now, screams echoing through the passages. The guards had made a point of dragging the victim past the bearded man&#x2019;s cell so that he would hear the desperate pleas for mercy. Another sample, a demonstration. You&#x2019;re next.<br><br>A new sound, this from outside. A rising mechanical thrum&#x2014;an approaching helicopter.<br><br>The man stirred, painfully levering himself upright and going to the little window. He ignored the foul smell from the latrines, narrowing his eyes against the harsh daylight as he watched uniformed men hurry into the courtyard to form an honor guard. Behind them came the prison&#x2019;s governor, a squat, toad-faced man in small gold-rimmed glasses. From his look of apprehension, it was clear that the new arrival was important.<br><br>The prisoner tensed. He knew who was aboard the helicopter.<br><br>Someone with very good reasons to hate him.<br><br>Dust and grit swirled as the helicopter descended. It was an elderly aircraft, a French-built Alouette III light utility chopper converted to what was known as &#x201c;G-Car&#x201d; specification by the addition of a pair of machine guns. A veteran of the civil war that led to Rhodesia&#x2019;s becoming Zimbabwe in 1980 . . . now being used as VIP transport for a man who fought in that war as a youth, gaining a nickname that he retained with pride to this day.<br><br>Gamba Boodu. &#x201c;The Butcher.&#x201d;<br><br>A guard opened the cabin door and Boodu stepped out, head high as if daring the still-whirling rotor blades above him to strike. Despite the baking temperatures, he wore a long black greatcoat over an immaculately fitted suit, the coat&#x2019;s hem flapping in the downdraft as he strode across the courtyard to the governor. Sunlight glinted off gold: a large ring on the middle finger of his right hand, inset with a sparkling emerald. That same hand held an object that he swung like a walking stick, its end stabbing into the ground with each step.<br><br>A machete, its handle decorated with lines of gold.<br><br>The bearded man remembered the weapon well. Some years earlier, he had wrested it from the militia leader and used it against him. The result was a deep, V-shaped line of pink against the Zimbabwean&#x2019;s dark skin, the scar the aftermath of a blow that had hacked clean through flesh to leave a bloody hole in his cheek like a second mouth.<br><br>He smiled, very faintly. The injury was only a fraction of what a murderer and sadist like Boodu deserved, but among his many unpleasant characteristics was vanity: Every look in the mirror would provide some punishment.<br><br>The smile disappeared as, formalities quickly over, Boodu and the governor marched into the prison buildings. They would soon come to the cell. The man returned to his filthy corner.<br><br>Footsteps over the screams. The wooden cover of the peephole slid back; then came the clatter and rasp of a key in the lock. The heavy door swung open. A guard entered first, pistol aimed at the still figure, who responded with nothing more than a fractional raising of his eyes. Next came the governor, broad mouth curled into a smirk, and finally Boodu himself. The machete&#x2019;s tip clinked down on the stone floor.<br><br>&#x201c;What a pleasant surprise,&#x201d; said Boodu, his deep voice filled with gloating satisfaction. &#x201c;Eddie Chase.&#x201d;<br><br>The balding Englishman lifted his head. &#x201c;Ay up,&#x201d; he said in a broad Yorkshire accent. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the face?&#x201d;<br><br>The line of the scar shifted as Boodu&#x2019;s expression tightened. &#x201c;It has healed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So who&#x2019;d you use as your plastic surgeon? Dr. Frankenstein?&#x201d;<br><br>The governor angrily clicked his fingers, and the guard booted Eddie hard in the side. He was about to deliver another blow when Boodu stopped him. &#x201c;Leave him for me,&#x201d; the Zimbabwean rumbled. He ground the machete&#x2019;s point over the floor, the sound as unpleasant as nails on a blackboard. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have some fun with him.&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie clutched his aching ribs. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re throwing us a big party with cakes and jelly?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The only thing that will be thrown is your corpse, into a pit,&#x201d; said Boodu. He rasped the blade over the flagstones again. &#x201c;You caused me a lot of pain, Chase&#x2014;professional and personal. Getting those criminals across the border made me look very bad in front of the president. It took me a long time to get back into his favor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Leaving the country &#x2019;cause you don&#x2019;t want to have your family raped and murdered doesn&#x2019;t make you a criminal.&#x201d;<br><br>Boodu snorted sarcastically. &#x201c;If you oppose the president, you are a criminal. And my country has far too many of these criminals&#x2014;this prison is full of them. They must be dealt with. Firmly.&#x201d; He paused to listen to a shriek from the torture chamber. &#x201c;Like your friend Strutter. A dog of war, spreading sedition, arranging for mercenaries to work for criminals. Mercenaries like you, Chase.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not anymore, mate. I had a career change.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I heard. We do still get the international news here in Zimbabwe, even if it is filled with lies about our country. You married an American, no? I&#x2019;m very sorry.&#x201d; He laughed. &#x201c;But I also heard that you got into some trouble, hey? You are wanted for murdering an Interpol officer! I was almost tempted to turn you over to them. But then&#x201d;&#x2014;he turned his face to display his mangled cheek to the prisoner&#x2014;&#x201c;I remembered that you gave me this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My pleasure,&#x201d; Eddie said with a sardonic grin.<br><br>&#x201c;It will soon be my pleasure.&#x201d; Boodu advanced, tapping the machete on the floor. He nodded to the guard. &#x201c;Hold him.&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie was kicked again, harder than before. While the Yorkshireman gasped for breath, the guard hauled him up and shoved him against the wall.<br><br>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; said Boodu, mouth somewhere between a smile and a snarl. He brought up the blade and sliced through one of Eddie&#x2019;s dirty, ragged sleeves&#x2014;and the skin beneath. Dark blood blossomed on the fabric.<br><br>Eddie choked back a growl of pain. &#x201c;You fucking cockwipe!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When I was told you had been arrested, I had it sharpened. Just for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hope you had it sterilized too,&#x201d; said Eddie as the guard released him. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t want to catch anything.&#x201d; He examined the cut. Boodu had been right about the machete&#x2019;s sharpness; the African&#x2019;s sweep had only been light, but still enough to open up a stinging gash in his arm.<br><br>Boodu laughed again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m disappointed in you, Chase. You knew you were a dead man if you ever came back to Zimbabwe&#x2014;so I congratulate you on your bravery, at least&#x2014;but you were a fool to be so open about it. We were watching all of Strutter&#x2019;s contacts. Did you really think we had forgotten you?&#x201d; He gestured at Eddie&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;A beard! That was your disguise? Very stupid. You must have spent too long in America, with all the comforts of marriage&#x2014;you forgot how the world really works.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t forget,&#x201d; said Eddie. Boodu was about to say something else when a prison official appeared at the door and indicated that he wished to speak to the governor. The two men exchanged muttered words, eyeing Eddie suspiciously, before the militia leader went over to join in the sotto voce discussion.<br><br>Before long, Boodu let out a sharp &#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; and, swinging the machete almost nonchalantly, turned back to Eddie. &#x201c;Where is it, Chase?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s what?&#x201d; Eddie replied, face a portrait of innocence.<br><br>&#x201c;You have a radio transmitter. My pilot picked it up and then used the prison&#x2019;s own receiver to triangulate its position. This cell.&#x201d;<br><br>The governor was already defensive. &#x201c;We searched him when he was brought here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not well enough,&#x201d; said Boodu, his look suggesting there would be repercussions for the oversight. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s why you were so open about coming here to rescue Strutter. You thought a homing beacon would help your friends rescue you if you got into trouble.&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;Not from here, Chase. Not from Fort Helena. Now, where is it? Or will I have to cut you apart to find it?&#x201d; He raised the machete again.<br><br>With a defeated look, Eddie unfastened his trousers. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get all excited, lads,&#x201d; he said as he reached into the back of his underwear and, straining in discomfort, extracted a small tubular object from where the sun didn&#x2019;t shine. &#x201c;Ow! Christ, you&#x2019;ve no idea how uncomfy that was. Made my eyes water.&#x201d;<br><br>Boodu was about to take it from Eddie when he noticed the unsavory coating on its metal surface and instructed the guard to hold it instead. With an expression of great distaste, the man held it up for his superiors to examine. It was around three inches long and a little over an inch in diameter, one end rounded off. A red LED blinked at the other, flat end, a tiny switch beside it. &#x201c;Does the switch turn it off?&#x201d; Boodu asked Eddie. The Englishman nodded.<br><br>Boodu gestured to the guard, who clicked the switch with a thumbnail. The LED went dark. Chuckling, he regarded Eddie again. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t have set it to transmit on a military frequency, Chase. A stupid mistake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I dunno,&#x201d; said Eddie. A sudden confidence in his voice was accompanied by distant sounds from outside, a series of flat thuds. Boodu stiffened, realizing that the situation had somehow changed. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t to tell my mates I was here.&#x201d; A broad smile exposed the gap between his front teeth. &#x201c;It was to tell &#x2019;em you were here.&#x201d;<br><br>He dropped and shielded his head&#x2014;<br><br>A rising high-pitched whine told Boodu what was happening&#x2014;but too late to do anything about it as mortar shells struck the prison.<br><br>A hole exploded in the corridor&#x2019;s ceiling, shrapnel ripping into the head and back of the prison official. The governor was also hit, the blast flinging him into the cell. Both Boodu and the guard were thrown off their feet as more detonations tore through the building.<br><br>Eddie lifted his head as the first round of shelling ceased. As planned, the bombs had been fired to impact in a pattern around his cell as soon as the beacon was switched off. Risky, but he&#x2019;d had confidence in his collaborators&#x2019; aim. The mortars were just over the top of a small ridge almost a mile from the fort, set up and sighted on his position by surreptitious use of a laser rangefinder during the early hours of the morning. So far, they were on target. The door hung off its hinges, the wall beside it smashed. A shaft of sunlight cut through the swirling dust from a hole in the roof.<br><br>He jumped up. The guard was closest to him, breaking out of his daze as he saw the prisoner move and standing clumsily, raising his gun&#x2014;<br><br>Eddie grabbed his arm and wrenched it up behind his back as he fired. The bullet smacked against the door.<br><br>The sound shocked the governor back to life. He fumbled for his own holstered weapon, broad face contorted in panic and fury.<br><br>Eddie twisted the guard&#x2019;s arm even harder, jamming the gun&#x2019;s muzzle into his lower back&#x2014;and his own index finger on top of his captive&#x2019;s. Four shots burst gorily through the guard&#x2019;s abdomen. Even mangled and smashed by their passage, the rounds still had enough force to tear into the governor&#x2019;s flesh. He screamed, gun forgotten as he writhed in agony from the mortal wounds.<br><br>Pulling the gun from the dead guard&#x2019;s hand, Eddie dropped the corpse and whirled to face Boodu. The Zimbabwean was on his hands and knees. As he squinted in pain and disorientation, his gaze fell upon his machete, the ornate handle just inches away. He grabbed it&#x2014;<br><br>Eddie&#x2019;s foot stamped down on the blade.<br><br>Boodu looked up to find the smoking, blood-dripping gun pointed right at him. &#x201c;All right, face-ache,&#x201d; Eddie growled. &#x201c;Let go.&#x201d; Boodu withdrew his hand and backed away. The Englishman bent to retrieve the machete. Outside, an alarm bell started ringing&#x2014;just as another round of far-off thumps reached the prison. &#x201c;Oh, and if I were you, I&#x2019;d duck.&#x201d;<br><br>Boodu shielded his head as another round of mortar shells struck their targets. These explosions were farther away, but still shook dust from the ceiling as guard towers were blasted into fragments and the prefabricated administration block blew apart, the remains collapsing on top of the prison staff inside.<br><br>Eddie jabbed Boodu with the machete. Another noise rose: the helicopter, its pilot desperately trying to take off. &#x201c;Okay, get up. Get up!&#x201d; He gestured with the gun toward the broken door. &#x201c;Move.&#x201d;<br><br>Boodu had no choice but to obey, though his voice seethed with defiance. &#x201c;Where are you taking me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Long term? Botswana. Short term,&#x201d; Eddie went on as the other man responded with confusion, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re going to do what I came here for&#x2014;get Strutter. Lead the way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t get out of here,&#x201d; Boodu spat as they exited the cell. Through the hole in the ceiling, they heard the Alouette&#x2019;s roar as it left the ground. &#x201c;The main gate is shut, and mortars won&#x2019;t break it&#x2014;I know, I attacked this place during the war. You need a tank. And you don&#x2019;t have one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me worry about that,&#x201d; said Eddie. He prodded him again, far from gently, with the machete&#x2019;s point. &#x201c;Come on, shift your arse.&#x201d;<br><br>Making an angry sound, Boodu stepped over the rubble littering the floor and moved down the passage, Eddie a few paces behind. Another explosion outside: a secondary detonation, one of the vehicles inside the compound. There would be a last round of shelling, then after that everything depended on getting the main gate open . . .<br><br>Frantic yelling and thumping came from a cell as they passed it, a man inside begging in the Shona language. Eddie checked the door, but it needed a key. Shit! He should have taken the set from the dead guard&#x2014;<br><br>-- Emily Kitt Scribe Inc. www.scribenet.com<br><br>main telephone: 215.336.5094 facsimile: 215.336.5094<br><br>7540 Windsor Drive Suite 200B Allentown PA 18195<br><br>842 South Second Street Philadelphia PA 19147<br><br>233 North Federal Highway Suites 61-3 Dania Beach FL 33004</p><h2>Master and Margarita: A Critical Companion (AATSEEL)</h2><p>An edited collection, part of the acclaimed AATSEEL Critical Companions series, that guides readers through Mikhail Bulgakov's satirical masterpiece.&nbsp;The introduction places <i>The Master and Margarita </i>and Bulgakov within Russian history and literature, and essays by prominent scholars offer opinion and analysis of the novel's structure, its place in current criticism, its connection to Goethe, and its symbolism and motifs.

Joseph Pugh, sick of Oxford and of teaching, decides to take some time off to live in a wild and beautiful Welsh farm valley. There he falls physically ill and is nursed back to health by Bronwen Vaughn, the wife of a neighboring farmer. Slowly, unwillingly, Bronwen and Pugh fall in love, and while that word is never spoken between them, their story is passionate and tragic.Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series of historical novels has been described as &#34;a masterpiece&#34; (David Mamet, New York Times), &#34;addictively readable&#34; (Patrick T. Reardon, Chicago Tribune), and &#34;the best historical novels ever written&#34; (Richard Snow, New York Times Book Review), which &#34;should have been on those lists of the greatest novels of the 20th century&#34; (George Will).Set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, O&#39;Brian&#39;s twenty-volume series centers on the enduring friendship between naval officer Jack Aubrey and physician (and spy) Stephen Maturin. The Far Side of the World, the tenth book in the series, was adapted into a 2003 film directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. The film was nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Picture.

Surveying antebellum popular media, he shows how the filibustering phenomenon infiltrated the American psyche in newspapers, theater, music, advertising, and literature. Condemned abroad as pirates, frequently in language strikingly similar to modern American denunciations of foreign terrorists, the filibusters were often celebrated at home as heroes who epitomized the spirit of Manifest Destiny.<br><br>May concludes by exploring the national consequences of filibustering, arguing that the practice inflicted lasting damage on U.S. relations with foreign countries and contributed to the North-South division over slavery that culminated in the Civil War.<br><br><br><br></p><p>"May has produced his magnum opus. . . .

Today, the three leading credit bureaus are among the most powerful institutions in modern life&#x2015;yet we know almost nothing about them. Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion are multi-billion-dollar corporations that track our movements, spending behavior, and financial status. This data is used to predict our riskiness as borrowers and to judge our trustworthiness and value in a broad array of contexts, from insurance and marketing to employment and housing. <br><br>In <i>Creditworthy</i>, the first comprehensive history of this crucial American institution, Josh Lauer explores the evolution of credit reporting from its nineteenth-century origins to the rise of the modern consumer data industry. By revealing the sophistication of early credit reporting networks, <i>Creditworthy</i> highlights the leading role that commercial surveillance has played&#x2015;ahead of state surveillance systems&#x2015;in monitoring the economic lives of Americans. Lauer charts how credit reporting grew from an industry that relied on personal knowledge of consumers to one that employs sophisticated algorithms to determine a person's trustworthiness. Ultimately, Lauer argues that by converting individual reputations into brief written reports&#x2015;and, later, credit ratings and credit scores&#x2015;credit bureaus did something more profound: they invented the modern concept of financial identity. <i>Creditworthy</i> reminds us that creditworthiness is never just about economic "facts." It is fundamentally concerned with&#x2015;and determines&#x2015;our social standing as an honest, reliable, profit-generating person.</p><p>Josh Lauer is an associate professor of media studies at the University of New Hampshire. His historical studies of communication technology, surveillance, and financial culture have appeared in <i>Technology and Culture</i>, <i>New Media &amp; Society</i>, and several edited collections.Who deserves credit? Who is a prime borrower, and who is subprime? The stakes of these questions could not be higher: loans are essential to the education, transport, and housing of millions. Lauer has written a compelling history of how businesses assess creditworthiness, from nineteenth-century trade associations to contemporary data science mavens. Lucid and packed with fascinating detail, <i>Creditworthy</i> is an essential guide to the intersection of finance and surveillance. (Frank Pasquale, University of Maryland)<br><br>Clearly written, well researched, and wide ranging, <i>Creditworthy</i> provides a fresh account of the evolution of credit agencies in the United States.

John, Columbia University)<br><br>At last! A book that drills down into the history of consumer credit-scoring and demonstrates its massive contribution to our daily experience of contemporary surveillance. Not just a vital chronicle of a hitherto hidden history but a principled account of what happens when human value is reduced to monetizing consumer details. <i>Creditworthy</i> penetrates to the core of contemporary capitalism&#x2019;s disturbing obsession with personal data. (David Lyon, Queen's University, Canada)<br><br>Consumer credit reporting is ubiquitous, but its pioneering role in the surveillance of consumers has been poorly understood&#x2015;until now. Josh Lauer has dug deep into the historical sources and marshaled his findings into a rich and cohesive narrative that encompasses business dynamics, social norms, technology, and regulation. This book will become the indispensable source on the history of both consumer credit reporting and the surveillance society. (Rowena Olegario, University of Oxford)<br><br>Josh Lauer has written an important book for anyone interested in the history of consumer credit. Long before there were FICO scores, consumers' creditworthiness was being assessed and considered.

Summoned to Swiss bank vaults, Fifth Avenue apartments, and Tokyo storerooms, they are entrusted by collectors, dealers, and museums to decide if a coveted picture is real or fake and to determine if it was painted by Leonardo da Vinci or Raphael. <i>The Eye</i> lifts the veil on the rarified world of connoisseurs devoted to the authentication and discovery of Old Master artworks.

I would like to talk about the fascinating and little-known profession of <i>being</i> an &#x201c;Eye.&#x201d; The term might sound curious and surprising, but it would be impossible to explain in other terms what certain art historians do on a daily basis. If what we might call the &#x201c;traditional&#x201d; art historian&#x2015;like the musicologist or the literary historian&#x2015;is content to draw on a rich library and a vast image bank, the task of what I call the &#x201c;Eye&#x201d; is to establish the authorship of paintings by sight alone. His task is to see. To do so, it is crucial that he have direct contact with each work of art. Traditional art historians, musicologists, and literary historians construct complex hypotheses and conduct extensive research in order to expound their theories in books. The Eye, on the other hand, relies on dramatic coups de th��tre. His task, in short, consists of proposing a name. Every day, he is presented with unknown works of art. All too often, they are disappointing. But sometimes he is struck by something extraordinary, something as clear and irrefutable as it is unexpected.</p><br><br><p>He is an &#x201c;Eye&#x201d; in the same way that someone might be a &#x201c;Nose&#x201d; in the perfume industry. Noses identify scents and formulate perfumes. Eyes in the art world discover paintings and establish authorship at a glance. But there the comparison ends. If the great Noses are creators, artists sometimes capable of moments of genius, neither Eyes nor art historians generally can be considered to be creators. Eyes observe, and this observation triggers a process of memory that allows them to see. The process is not a form of genius but an acutely refined sense of analysis, an ability to break down the painting one is looking at into a collection of distinctive traits found in the diverse works of an artist.</p><br><br><p>It is this skill that enables the Eye to make discoveries. Unlike discoveries in mathematics, chemistry, or physics&#x2015;those of Newton or Einstein for example, which are the product of the genius of an individual&#x2015;the discoveries made by the Eye have more in common with that of Christopher Columbus. No genius was required. Merely a spirit of adventure and a happy accident, the result of a wager that he could find a new shipping route between Europe and India. The Eye is a miniature Christopher Columbus who roves the world of art, alert to any surprises. But whereas Christopher Columbus did not know what he had stumbled upon, the Eye on the other hand knows immediately. Like an explorer rediscovering Atlantis and knowing it can be nothing else. When an Eye is confronted with a work whose authorship he alone can identify, we say he has made a discovery. The more important the artist, the more important the discovery; and should the work in question be a masterpiece, executed by one of the greatest painters in history yet overlooked for centuries, we might even say a &#x201c;great discovery.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>For an Eye, discoveries of this kind are very rare. He may search tenaciously for something, often without success, and then, without intending to, make unexpected discoveries. I confess that I have made at least one such discovery, completely by chance. It happened in October 2005, in the company of an Italian friend, Carlo Falciani, a specialist in sixteenth-century Italian painting like myself. We had been invited to Provence by an art collector in order to consider a painting that, though interesting, did not turn out to be the work we had hoped, and as so often is the case, the collector was left disappointed; in return, however, we made a discovery that would prove crucial to the history of art.</p><br><br><p>The previous day, we had visited the Mus�e des Beaux-Arts in Nice, where Carlo&#x2019;s wife, also an art historian, wanted to study a number of paintings. The Villa Kotchoubey, which houses the museum, is one of the last vestiges of the C�te d&#x2019;Azur whose dying echoes and fading light are captured in <i>Tender is the Night</i> by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the C�te d&#x2019;Azur where the cream of European society came to sojourn before the Great War. At the moment when, all around, apartment blocks began to replace the sprawling grounds of the great nineteenth-century mansions, the city bought this villa from a Russian aristocratic family and transformed it into a museum. Here and there between the facades, it is possible to glimpse a sliver of the blue Mediterranean. Not far from the international airport, perched high in the hills of the city, it is one of the last remnants of the Belle �poque. The ground floor comprises a great hall with a gleaming granite floor bounded by marble columns and flanked by a monumental staircase and a covered courtyard.</p><br><br><p>Heading toward the great staterooms, one first passes through a long gallery whose walls are lined with fin-de-si�cle paintings in keeping with the ambiance of the villa. Society portraits and oriental scenes, including <i>The Harem Servant Girl</i> by Paul-D�sir� Trouillebert, plunge the visitor into the atmosphere of the period. At the far end of the gallery, the room is lit by a vast window. The sun, a frequent visitor to the bay of Nice, was high in the sky that morning, its rays piercing the panes at a steep angle. I remember we were chatting about this and that as we cast an inattentive glance over the collection, perhaps about the painting we planned to see the following day, when our eyes were drawn to a painting of Christ that hung at the far end of the hallway, a beam of sunlight falling upon the feet, glistening on nails that had a porcelain texture that to me was unmistakable. &#x201c;Do you see what I see?&#x201d; asked Carlo. Conversation gave way to a stunned silence. We were seeing the same thing. A providential ray of sunlight had revealed Bronzino&#x2019;s <i>Christ on the Cross</i>, painted by the artist for the Panciatichi family in Florence circa 1540, a work long since lost and vainly sought by connoisseurs of Florentine art of the period.</p><br><br><p>It is quite a large painting. At five feet tall and three feet wide, it resembles an altarpiece. It depicts Christ crucified in perfect pallor and realism. The right leg, into whose foot a nail is embedded, is turned slightly inward. The prominent cheekbones, the hollow cheeks, the deep bags under the eyes are testament to a long ordeal. Even the slightest detail of the musculature is visible. The pastel pink loincloth intended to hide the Christ&#x2019;s nakedness, with its realistic folds, has fallen slightly to reveal narrow hips in which it is possible to make out the bones. Beneath the head, tilted slightly to the right, the reddish-blond hair spills in tight, perfectly defined curls onto shoulders of alabaster. The painter has gone so far as to indicate, with light brush strokes, the grain in the wood of the cross.</p><br><br><p>As our eyes moved up the body, led by the distinctive rendering of the toenails, and without exchanging a word, we could both hear the echoing words of his first biographer, Giorgio Vasari, an artist himself and contemporary of Bronzino: &#x201c;For Bartolomeo Panciatichi, he painted a picture of the Crucifixion, which is executed with great study and care, insomuch that it is clearly evident that he copied it from a real dead body fixed on a cross.&#x201d; The scene is framed against an alcove of gray stone, the <i>pietra serena</i>, or &#x201c;serene stone,&#x201d; typical of the material used in the construction of religious buildings and important civil monuments in Florence. A thin trickle of blood runs from the feet down the wood and soaks into the stone niche.</p><br><br><p>It was an indescribable moment.</p></p><h2>The History of Christian Thought</h2><p>Why read about the history of Christian thought? Because, if you are Christian yourself, it helps you to understand the faith--addressing everything from where Christians got their ideas of the Trinity and how Christ can be both human and divine to what they think about issues like feminism, globalization and social justice. And because, even if you are not, all Western society has been shaped by the influence of thinkers like Augustine, Aquinas and Luther. You can&#39;t understand the world as it is without knowing something about Christian thought. Jonathan Hill has the uncanny ability to sketch portraits of his subjects--whether early church apologists, medieval doctors of the church, Reformation giants, nineteenth-century philosophical behemoths or contemporary feminist scholars--that are simultaneously lively, brief and revealing. Similarly, he ably penetrates to the nub of their thought, combining apt description with pithy quotations from their work. Significant events, councils, movements and terms are introduced and explained, which put the cast of characters in context and illumine their place within the development of Christian thought. Not content to merely describe, Hill offers pertinent assessments that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of his subjects&#39; contributions to Christian thinking and spurs you to reflect on significant issues for yourself. A society with no grasp of its history is like a person without a memory. So Hill, in this lively and accessible introduction, offers you a wealth of insight on the history of Christian thought and the colorful personalities of those who gave it shape and form.</p><p><strong>Jonathan Hill</strong> earned a first-class degree in philosophy and theology from Oxford University and an M.Phil. in theology (also from Oxford), specializing in the church fathers. Since 1997, he has worked as a writer and editor, dividing his time between Oxford and New Zealand. His books include <em>Faith in the Age of Reason</em> and <em>What Has Christianity Ever Done for Us?</em>There are massive reference books with copious information to which I could turn, but I also needed something compact, something I could keep on my desk for the quick reference between lectures. Then a friends introduced me to [this] very handy little book. It was just what I needed. This succinct volume packs a load of useful information. Each entry is clear and easy to read. Hill does a fine job of simplifying complex ideas without being unduly simplistic. Another notalbe characteristic is that Hill treats different schools of thought in a balanced and objective way. (The Bodley Roundtable, March 4, 2008)<br><br>"An enormous subject, tackled in a lively and accessible way." (Publishing News)<br><br>"Well-informed, comprehensive, generous without being uncritical, the history is written in a lively and untechnical style and gives the reader just what's required to see the development of Christian thought in its scope and in its parts. For breadth, clarity and accessibility, this book has few equals." (John Webster, University of Aberdeen)<br><br>"Scholars and other interested readers will appreciate the succinct, authoritative work of Jonathan Hill in this book. Serious differences now exist on how best to relate the history of Christian thought, but Hill does good work with how he has chosen to tell the story." (Mark Noll, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History, University of Notre Dame)<br><br>"A fascinating and invaluable book, accessible to the nonexpert but also a reliable resource for the student and even the teacher. For those . . . who simply want to browse through the ideas of some of the greatest minds of the Christian era, it is sheer delight." (David Winter, former head of BBC Religious Broadcasting)</p><h2>The Explorer&#39;s Garden: Rare and Unusual Perennials</h2><p>Dan Hinkley's quest for distinctive plants has led him on expeditions to China, Korea, Nepal, Chile, and remote areas of North America. <i>The Explorer's Garden: Rare and Unusual Perennials </i>presents the most fascinating perennials found during Hinkley's treks around the globe, describes the assets each plant brings to the garden, and explains how it is best cultivated and propagated.<br><br>Illustrated with Hinkley's own splendid photographs as well as those of Lynne Harrison, this new paperback edition includes a new preface by the author and a completely updated list of sources for plant material.<br></p><p>If, like so many other gardeners the world over, you're enamored of Dan Hinkley's Heronswood Nursery catalog, you'll love the <i>Explorer's Garden</i>. Heronswood is a wildly successful nursery in Kingston, Washington, that offers many of the most beautiful and unusual plants available anywhere. My guess is that once <i>The Explorer's Garden</i> is read through for pleasure, it will be used over and over again as a supplement to the catalog, as it thoroughly describes the plants Hinkley offers at Heronswood, and offers information on how best to grow them.<p> <i>The Explorer's Garden</i> is part sheer adventure, part the story of Hinkley's intense love and appreciation for the flora of Planet Earth. While fascinating for the botanist with its tales of plants growing in their native habitats at the far corners of the world, <i>The Explorer's Garden</i> also satisfies the gardener by emphasizing which plants are most garden-worthy. Out of the many masterworts (Astrantia) now available, Hinkley tells us that the cultivar known as "Margery Fish" or "Shaggy" is one of the best of the lot. He sorts through the virtues of the many hardy geraniums, distinguishing G.&nbsp;sylvaticum "Amy Doncaster" for its deep-blue upturned flowers with white eyes; he calls G.&nbsp;phaeum exceptional for its striking, purple-blotched foliage. This is just the kind of information gardeners need to know. We may grow plants better by understanding from whence they hail, but it is experienced guidance in choosing amongst the hosts of available plants that keeps us reading, notepad to hand.</p><p> And if you think that this book will help you to fill up your garden with the best perennials, just remember that Hinkley has two more books to follow in <i>The Explorer's Garden</i> series. So leave some room, on your bookshelf and in your garden, for trees and shrubs. <i>--Valerie Easton</i></p>The author is one of today's most active plant explorers. His plant introductions - &amp; some choice Native American plants - are featured in this beautifully illustrated new book.</p><h2>The Pushcart Prize XLIII: Best of the Small Presses 2019 Edition</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;More good poems, essays and stories are found in these presses than any other place on the planet.&#x201d; Richard Ford</strong></p> This 43rd edition of the annual Pushcart Prize &#x2013; the most celebrated literary series in America &#x2013; is further proof that these days the heat and heart of contemporary writing is often found in small presses scattered around the country and the world, far from the pressures of commercial centers.

The charismatic rogue has never met a woman who can discourage his advances, and after a show of resolve Lily too melts under Heath&#x2019;s sensuous kisses. Perhaps that is why she decides to hide out in the last place a gentleman would look for a lady: a house of scandalous repute.<br><br>In bold pursuit, Heath discovers his enchanting spitfire cheerfully instructing the demimonde in the art of deportment. Now the thrill of the chase is exceeded only by his powerful need to possess Lily as his bride.

She recently moved with her real-life hero to the Rocky Mountains of Utah, where she is at work on the next book of her scorching Notorious series&#x2013;tales of dangerous rakes and bold adventurers during the Regency era.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>Lady Freemantle&#x2019;s matchmaking is vexing enough to drive a saint mad, and you know I am no saint.<br>&#x2014;Miss Lily Loring to Fanny Irwin<br><br>Danvers Hall<br>Chiswick, England<br>June 1817<br><br>&#x201c;I cannot understand why he flusters me so,&#x201d; Lilian Loring mumbled unevenly to the gray cat. &#x201c;No man has ever unsettled me this way.&#x201d;<br><br>A soft purr was the only reply Lily received to her complaint.<br><br>&#x201c;It is not merely because he is handsome, either. I am not ord&#x2019;narily attracted to handsome noblemen.&#x201d; If anything she was highly wary of them. &#x201c;And I care nothing for his rank and consequence.&#x201d;<br><br>Giving a woozy sigh, Lily stretched out in the straw as she stroked the cat&#x2019;s fur. She was hard-pressed to explain the deplorable effect that Heath Griffin, Marquess of Claybourne, had on her. Particularly since she had just met him for the first time this morning at her sister&#x2019;s wedding.<br><br>&#x201c;The trouble is, he is too sharm . . . charming.&#x201d; And virile. And vital. And powerful.<br><br>Whatever his attributes, they made her absurdly breathless and agitated.<br><br>&#x201c;Devil take &#x2019;im. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Lily bit her lip and fell silent upon registering how slurred her words sounded. No doubt the result of drinking three full glasses of champagne&#x2014;which was at least two glasses too many, given how spirits of any kind went directly to her head. But the events of the evening had been dismaying enough to drive her to imbibe.<br><br>She wasn&#x2019;t completely foxed at the moment, yet it had probably been a mistake to attempt climbing up to the stable loft wearing a ball gown&#x2014;an exquisite confection of pale rose silk&#x2014;and dancing slippers. Weaving her way up the ladder in such narrow skirts while carrying a napkinful of tidbits had challenged her usual athleticism. But she had wanted to bring supper for Boots before she left the wedding celebrations.<br><br>Boots, the Danvers Hall stable cat, had recently given birth to a litter of kittens. Currently the family of felines was contentedly curled up in the box Lily had arranged in the loft to protect the mother cat and her new offspring from the home-farm dogs. Lily had left her lantern hanging on a peg below so as not to frighten the youngsters, and the muted golden glow contributed to the tranquility of the loft, as did the warmth of the night, since it was nearly summer.<br><br>The three kittens were little balls of fluff, their eyes barely open, but they were beginning to show their own unique personalities&#x2014;much like the Loring sisters, Lily thought. The sight of the baby kittens blinking sleepily up at her roused intensely tender feelings in her chest, since she had a soft spot for the helpless and less fortunate.<br><br>If she was honest with herself, however, she would admit that she&#x2019;d sought refuge in the stable loft as much to escape Lord Claybourne as to feed the estate cat and indulge in a bout of self-pity.<br><br>While Boots was nibbling delicately on breast of roast pheasant, Lily carefully reached inside the box and picked up one of the adorable kittens.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you re&#x2019;lize how precious you are?&#x201d; she murmured, pressing her nose into its soft ebony fur. The black kitten was the rambunctious one, like Lily herself, and it swatted at her nose playfully.<br><br>Lily gave a low laugh, which helped staunch the ache in her throat at the poignant memories she was trying to hold at bay.<br><br>It had been a lovely wedding this morning in the village church, where her eldest sister Arabella had married Marcus Pierce, the new Earl of Danvers. An enormous wedding breakfast and ball had followed at Danvers Hall, with nearly six hundred guests in attendance. The celebrations had gone splendidly, due in large part to her middle sister Roslyn&#x2019;s untiring efforts and hostess skills.<br><br>The ball would continue for at least another hour or two, until after midnight, but Lily and Roslyn had said farewell to Arabella in private a short while ago, sharing tears of happiness and sadness.<br><br>It was extremely hard for Lily to bear, losing Arabella to marriage, but the evening had been made even more difficult by the meddlesome matchmaking efforts of their kindly patron, Winifred, Lady Freemantle. Several years ago, when the Loring sisters had been penniless and in desperate need of earning their own livings, Winifred had supplied the funds to start their Academy for Young Ladies for the daughters of the wealthy merchant class. All during the ball, Winifred had kept pushing Lily in the path of Marcus&#x2019;s close friend, the Marquess of Claybourne.<br><br>Eventually, much to her chagrin and dismay, Winifred cornered her and practically forced his lordship to dance with her.<br><br>&#x201c;You will be delighted to have so desirable a dance partner as Miss Lilian, my lord, no mistake,&#x201d; the middle-aged matron assured him.<br><br>&#x201c;Delighted and honored,&#x201d; Claybourne replied, smiling lazily down at Lily.<br><br>She felt color heat her cheeks. As her traitorous friend turned away, beaming with sly glee, Lily stared back at Claybourne, vexed and tongue-tied.<br><br>The marquess was tall and powerful, with an air of breathtaking virility that commanded attention. His hair was a tawny brown, his eyes a gold-flecked hazel, and he had an utterly masculine face that made countless feminine hearts flutter.<br><br>Lily discovered that she was no different. Deplorably aware of her quickening pulse and heightened senses, she stood there feeling awkward and fuming at Winifred&#x2019;s machinations. It was mortifying, being paraded before the very wealthy, very eligible marquess like a heifer at a fair.<br><br>She remained mute as she accepted Lord Claybourne&#x2019;s hand and let him lead her onto the ballroom floor. And when the orchestra struck up the opening bars of a waltz, she reluctantly moved into his arms. She did not like being so close to him, to his heat and vitality. Nor was she pleased at how conscious she was of his body, of his natural grace, his easy sensuality as he guided her to the lilting rhythm of the music. She had never observed such things about a man before. Normally she only noticed a man&#x2019;s potential for brutality, the size of his fists&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you dislike dancing in general, Miss Loring?&#x201d; Claybourne finally asked to break the silence between them. &#x201c;Or do you object to dancing with me in particular?&#x201d;<br><br>Lily was taken aback by his perceptiveness. &#x201c;Why would you think I object, my lord?&#x201d; she hedged.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps because of that fearsome scowl you are wearing.&#x201d;<br><br>Feeling a fresh flush tinge her cheeks, she forced a polite smile. &#x201c;I beg your pardon. Dancing is not my favorite pastime.&#x201d;<br><br>Those jeweled eyes glinted down from beneath heavy brows. &#x201c;You do it quite well. I confess that surprises me.&#x201d;<br><br>She raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Why should it surprise you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because Marcus claims you are a spitfire and a hoyden. I understand you would rather enjoy a good gallop across a field than be caught dead in a ballroom.&#x201d;<br><br>That honest observation won a reluctant laugh from Lily. &#x201c;Most decidedly I prefer riding to waltzing, my lord, although &#x2018;spitfire&#x2019; is a bit harsh. Marcus thinks I am one because I frequently quarreled with him about Arabella when he was courting her. But I am fairly even-tempered. However, I freely admit to being a hoyden&#x2014;except when I play teacher at our Academy and must set a good example. Or upon occasions such as this, when I am required to endure the social niceties for my sisters&#x2019; sakes. In truth, I find a certain pleasure in defying the dictates of the ton.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can admire a rebel,&#x201d; he said, his tone edged with amusement. &#x201c;You are very different from your sisters, are you not?&#x201d;<br><br>His observation earned a sharp look from Lily. She regarded Claybourne suspiciously, unable to tell if he considered the difference favorable or not.<br><br>Not that she minded if his judgment of her was unfavorable. Nor did it bother her that she always fell short in comparisons with her sisters. Both Arabella and Roslyn were remarkable beauties with fair hair, creamy complexions, and tall, elegant figures.<br><br>Lily couldn&#x2019;t match their height or aristocratic bearing&#x2014;in addition to having dark hair and eyes and a rosy coloring that made her seem a changeling in her blond, blue-eyed family. Moreover, her sisters were the epitome of grace and ladylike gentility, while her own high spirits and stubborn aversion to conforming to the absurdly stuffy precepts of the ruling elite regularly led her into trouble.<br><br>But Lily had no intention of apologizing to his lordship for her subversive tendencies. Indeed, to her mind, the less conversation she had with him the better.<br><br>He, however, did not appear inclined to take her hint and keep silent. &#x201c;Did you enjoy the wedding ceremony this morning, Miss Loring?&#x201d;<br><br>That topic was an extreme sore point with her also, although she managed to hide her wince. &#x201c;Arabella made a beautiful bride,&#x201d; she said carefully.<br><br>&#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t approve of your sister marrying my friend.&#x201d;<br><br>Lily&#x2019;s frown returned as she scanned the ballroom for the bridal couple and found Arabella and Marcus laughing together as they waltzed. &#x201c;I fear she may be making a mistake, wedding so suddenly. They have known each other for barely two months.&#x201d;</p><h2>Chevrolet By the Numbers 1970-75: How to Identify and Verify All V-8 Drivetrain Parts For Small and Big Blocks</h2><p>Restoring your Chevy to original factory specs?

An Indian writer who has also lived in England and the United States, Gita Mehta was ideally placed to observe the spectacle of European and American "pilgrims" interacting with their hosts. When she finally recorded her razor sharp observations in Karma Cola, the book became an instant classic for describing, in merciless detail, what happens when the traditions of an ancient and longlived society are turned into commodities and sold to those who don't understand them.<br><br>In the dazzling prose that has become her trademark, Mehta skewers the entire Spectrum of seekers: The Beatles, homeless students, Hollywood rich kids in detox, British guilt-trippers, and more. In doing so, she also reveals the devastating byproducts that the Westerners brought to the villages of rural lndia -- high anxiety and drug addiction among them.<br><br>Brilliantly irreverent, Karma Cola displays Gita Mehta's gift for weaving old and new, common and bizarre, history and current events into a seamless and colorful narrative that is at once witty, shocking, and poignant.</p><p>&#34;It is a sad, hilarious, rueful tale and Mehta tells it with a rich fund of irony, satire, acerbic wit and insight.&#34;--The Los Angeles TimesNo one has observed the West&#39;s invasion of India more astutely than Gita Mehta. In &#39;Karma Cola&#39; the acclaimed novelist trains an unblinking journalistic eye on jaded sadhus and beatific acid burnouts, the Bhagwan and Allen Ginsberg, guilt-tripping English girls and a guru who teaches gullible tourists how to view their previous incarnations.</p><h2>33 Months as a POW in Stalag Luft III: A World War II Airman Tells His Story</h2><p>An American World War II prisoner tells his version of The Great Escape.</p><p>Albert P.

This volume details the history, culture and conflicts of the &#39;Woodland&#39; Indians, a name assigned to all the tribes living east of the Mississippi River between the Gulf of Mexico and James Bay, including the Siouans, Iroquians, and Algonkians. In at least three major battles between Indian and Euro-American military forces more soldiers were killed than at the battle of Little Bighorn in 1876, when George Custer lost his command. With the aid of numerous illustrations and photographs, including eight full page colour plates by Richard Hook, this title explores the history and culture of the American Woodland Indians.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.An unrivaled source of information on the uniforms, insignia and appearance of the world&#39;s fighting men of past and present.

Immigration and Crime covers both a variety of immigrant groups&#x2014;mainly from Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America&#x2014;and a variety of topics including: victimization, racial conflict, juvenile delinquency, exposure to violence, homicide, drugs, gangs, and border violence.<br>The volume provides important insights about past understandings of immigration and crime, many based on theories that have proven to be untrue or racially biased, as well as offering new scholarship on salient topics. Overall, the contributors argue that fears of immigrant crime are largely unfounded, as immigrants are themselves often more likely to be the victims of discrimination, stigmatization, and crime rather than the perpetrators.<br>Contributors: Avraham Astor, Carl L.

The battles in Normandy and on the German frontier have been studied often and in detail, while the fight for the Scheldt estuary, Walcheren and Antwerp itself has been treated as a sideshow. Graham Thomas&#x2019;s timely and graphic account underlines the importance of this aspect of the Allied campaign and offers a fascinating insight into a complex combined-arms operation late in the Second World War. <br><br>Using operational reports and vivid firsthand eyewitness testimony, he takes the reader alongside 21 Army Group as it cleared the Channel ports of Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk, then moved on to attack the Scheldt and the island stronghold of Walcheren. Overcoming entrenched German resistance there was essential to the whole operation, and it is the climax of his absorbing narrative.</p><p>Graham A. Thomas is a historian and editor of British Army Review, the British Army&#x2019;s journal of military thought. He is a military historian specializing in aerial warfare, land-based twentieth-century campaigns and British naval and maritime history in the eighteenth century.

Let me out!"<br><br> Emma's throat was ragged from shouting; her hands throbbed from pounding her fists against the metal door.<br><br> "Let me out!"<br><br> She had woken with a jolt several hours earlier--covered in sweat, Kate's name upon her lips--to find herself alone in a strange room. She didn't question the fact that it was no longer night, that she was no longer in the clearing. She didn't even wonder where she now was. None of that mattered. She'd been abducted, she was a prisoner, she had to escape. It was that simple.<br><br> "Let me out!"<br><br> The first thing she'd done--after trying the door and confirming that it was indeed locked--had been to inspect her cell to see if it offered any obvious means of escape. It hadn't. The walls, floor, and ceiling were made from large blocks of black stone. The three small windows, too high up for Emma to reach, showed nothing but blue sky. Besides that, there was the bed on which she'd woken--really just a mattress and a few blankets--and some food: a plate of flatbread, bowls of yogurt and yellow-brown hummus, some burned, unidentifiable meat, a clay jug of water. The food and water Emma had hurled out a window in a fit of pride and anger, an act she was now regretting as she was both hungry and very, very thirsty.<br><br> "Let--me--out!"<br><br> Emma leaned, exhausted, against the door. She felt the urge to sink to the floor, put her face in her hands, and sob. But then she thought of Kate, her older sister, and of hearing Kate's voice as Rourke had carried her across the clearing. Their sister had returned from the past only to die right in front of them. And Michael, though he was Keeper of the Book of Life, had been unable to bring her back (leading Emma to question what, then, was the point in having something called the Book of Life). But she had heard Kate's voice! That meant Michael must've succeeded! Kate was alive! And knowing Kate was out there somewhere meant there was no way, like zero-point-zero-zero-zero-zero percent chance, that Emma was just going to sit down and cry.<br><br> "LET--ME--OUT!"<br><br> Her forehead was still pressed against the cold metal of the door, and she was screaming directly into it, feeling the vibrations as she struck the door with her fists.<br><br> "LET--ME--"<br><br> Emma stopped; she held her breath. The whole time she'd been hitting the door and screaming, she'd been met with total, thundering silence. But now she heard something, footsteps. They were faint and somewhere far below her, but they were growing louder. Emma backed away from the door and looked about for a weapon, cursing herself once again for throwing the clay jug out the window.<br><br> The footsteps grew even louder, a heavy, rhythmic thud--thud--thud. Emma decided that when the door opened, she would rush past whoever it was. Wasn't Michael always saying something about the element of surprise? If only her big toe didn't hurt so bad. She was pretty sure she'd broken it kicking the stupid door. The footsteps had stopped just outside her room, and there was the metallic rasp of a bolt being slid back. Emma tensed and got ready to spring.<br><br> Then the door opened, Rourke ducked inside, and all Emma's plans of escape vanished. The giant man filled the doorway; a fly couldn't have squeezed past.<br><br> "My, my. Aren't you making quite the racket."<br><br> He was wearing a long black coat that was lined with fur and had a high fur collar. He had on black boots that came nearly to his knees. He was smiling, showing miles of large white teeth, and his skin was smooth and unscarred, the burns the volcano had left on his face, which Emma had seen when he'd seized her in the clearing, now completely healed.<br><br> Emma felt the stone wall pressing against her back. She forced herself to look up and meet Rourke's gaze.<br><br> She said, "Gabriel's gonna kill you."<br><br> The giant laughed. Really laughed, throwing back his head like people did in movies, the sound booming off the ceiling.<br><br> "And a very good morning to you too, young lady."<br><br> "Where am I? How long have I been here?"<br><br> With Rourke standing before her, and the possibility of escape now essentially nil, Emma wanted the answers she hadn't cared about before.<br><br> "Oh, just since last night. And as to your location: you're at the far end of the world, and everything around you is shrouded in enchantments. Your friends could pass by and never know. You will not be rescued."<br><br> "Ha! Your stupid spells aren't gonna stop Dr. Pym. He'll just do that"--Emma snapped her fingers--"and this whole place will fall apart."<br><br> Rourke smiled at her, and Emma recognized it as the smile adults give children when they aren't taking them seriously. Had Rourke's face been anywhere remotely within reach, Emma would've punched it.<br><br> "I think, lass, that you're overestimating your wizard and underestimating my master."<br><br> "What're you talking about? The stupid Dire Magnus is dead. Dr. Pym told us."<br><br> Another of those annoying smiles. He was really asking for it.<br><br> "Was dead, child. But no more. My master is returned. You should know. You saw him yourself."<br><br> "No, I didn't--"<br><br> Emma fell silent. An image had come to her from the night before, that of the green-eyed boy stepping from the flames. And with the memory, a shadow seemed to fall over her. She struggled to throw it off, told herself it was impossible, that boy couldn't be the Dire Magnus!</p><h2>SUPERIOR SPIDER-MAN COMPANION (Superior Spider-man Companion, 1)</h2><p>Otto Octavius has taken Peter Parker's body, his costume - his life! - to become a Superior Spider-Man.

The recent pedophile Savile scandal in London was foreshadowed by rampant abuses in Belgium, fiefdom of NATO. Their purpose: to subvert democracy through blackmail. <p> GLADIO reveals the story of mayhem and murder, of corruption and subversion of democracy, behind NATO's secret "alliance" against decency and democracy. </p><p> Masquerading as a rear guard against Soviet invaders, NATO's covert forces warped into psychological and physical terrorism. These were the 'years of lead,' in which hundreds perished in a synthetic war in the streets of Europe. NATO commander General Lyman Lemnitzer ordered attempts to kill French president Charles de Gaulle. Sacked from the Pentagon and exiled to Europe by JFK, did Lemnitzer reap revenge in Dallas? </p><p> The secret armies forged bonds with the Mafia. NATO-backed coups struck down governments in Greece and Turkey; Cyprus was sundered amid bitter genocide. Urban guerrillas like the Red Brigades and the Baader-Meinhof Gang were manipulated to torpedo democracy. Italy gained a deep-state government, the ultra-secret P2 pseudo-Masonic lodge, founded by former Blackshirts. </p><p> Swedish premier Olof Palme and Italian ex-PM Aldo Moro were assassinated. Pope John Paul II was shot by Turkish gangsters who had regular work as Gladio guns for hire. In 2009, the Turkish Gladio unit named Ergenekon surfaced in Turkey. The shootings in Norway in July 2011, and in Belgium, France and Italy in 2012, all bore the classic stripe of Gladio false-flag operations.</p><p> Editorial Review: In this gripping expos�, Richard Cottrell&#x2014;a former European Parliament MP and a veteran journalist and broadcaster&#x2014;goes behind the scenes to examine NATO's historical role and its relationship with British intelligence, the Pentagon and Nazi, Vatican, Mafia and other interests. He explains how and why NATO changed its emphasis after the Soviet Union's collapse and conducted operations in Yugoslavia. Iraq, Afghanistan. Libya and now Syria. Cottrell impresses with the quality of his research, naming key names and explaining ugly events involving bombings, assassinations, propaganda, missile crises, biowarfare, vote-rigging and other outrages. This is an important alternative history that fills in many gaps in our understanding. -- Nexus Magazine.</p></p><p>Richard Cottrell is a British journalist, politician and writer. He contributed regularly on politics and economics to the ITV network. In 1979 he was elected as a Conservative to the European Parliament. Over the next ten years he sat on the parliament&#x2019;s important committees and published two books -- The Sacred Cow, a polemical attack on the EU&#x2019;s farm policy, and Blood on Their Hands, which extended his parliamentary inquiry into the murder of British journalist Ann Chapman under the Greek military junta. His findings cleared an innocent man. He wrote the highly praised landmark Cottrell Report on the activities of pseudo-religious cults such as the Moonies and their harmful influence. Richard entered politics as an enthusiastic European but became disillusioned with "the inner workings of a profoundly anti-democratic system."Richard Cottrell's Gladio is a tour de force. Explosive, topical, and up to the minute, it takes the reader into realms of research usually reserved to those who spend years digging deep into history. Cottrell presents a wealth of insight and factual knowledge that is unmatched. Gladio is a must have for anyone who values the truth. --Madison Ruppert, End the Lie<br><br>An exhaustive chronicle of the doings and mis-doings of NATO and its motley clandestine collaborators might be expected to take some swallowing. And not just because the very notion of the thin veneer of democracy masking an endemic and far-reaching woodworm infestation tends to make the average punter queasy and inclined to hold tighter to the more comfortable delusions inherent in the approved narrative.<p> Even those of us who always suspected there was something nasty in the nursery have been assailed by so much conspiracy theory that we would be forgiven for shrugging resignedly at the prospect of five hundred pages of all is not what it seems spookery.</p><p> 'Yeah, yeah. Tell me about it.'</p><p> But Richard Cottrell is not of the tinfoil hat brigade; nor is he a purveyor of perverse propositions.</p><p> He has spent much time in the thick of it in person -- as a member of the European parliament, as a journalist, and even as an appointed rapporteur on one of the ever more compelling cases he instances of dark forces tampering with mass reality.</p><p> Such cases stack up to a clearly repeated pattern and an increasingly recognisable M.O. which, taken together, betray the same criminal intents, and frequently the same criminals.</p><p> Cottrell's achievement here is monumental, not only in providing an encyclopaedic list of 'deep state' atrocities, false-flag capers and universal corruption, but in whisking us through it at a breathless pace, so that it reads more like a le Carr� novel than a charge sheet.</p><p> The author weaves his tangled web with wit and authority, not least because he doesn't, himself, practice to deceive. Where the evidence refuses to add up, or isn't all in yet, he won't jump to conclusions merely to support his general thrust.</p><p> The meticulous nature of his research is alone enough to engender confidence in the veracity of his naming of names and identification of times, places, sequences and consequences.</p><p> In addition, a fine talent for metaphor and simile keeps the reader from flagging as he or she is bustled from continent to continent in company with drug racketeers, mad bombers, freelance anarchists, dodgy bankers with their hands in the Vatican's tills, dictators taking dictation from surprising quarters, 'terrorists' who didn't know the time of day, paedophiles, blackmailers and even the occasional honest person.</p><p> If you know there's something going on here, but you don't know what it is, get into Gladio.</p><p> The quality of the author's prose and his ability to hold on to the thread through all those events over all those years and all those pages make this a vital cornerstone for a library of inside knowledge. --Dave Randle, The Liberty Beacon</p></p><h2>Soldiers of God: With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan and Pakistan</h2><p>First time in paperback, with a new Introduction and final chapter <br><br>World affairs expert and intrepid travel journalist Robert D.

Attracting no attention, Stanislav Shumovsky had completed his journey from Moscow to enrol at a top American university. He was concealed in a group of 65 Soviet students heading to prestigious academic institutions. But he was after far more than an excellent education.<br><br> Recognizing Russia was 100 years behind the encircling capitalist powers, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had sent Shumovsky on a mission to acquire America&#x2019;s vital secrets to help close the USSR&#x2019;s yawning technology gap. The road to victory began in the classrooms and laboratories of MIT.<br><br> Shumovsky&#x2019;s destination soon became the unwitting finishing school for elite Russian spies. The USSR first transformed itself into a military powerhouse able to confront and defeat Nazi Germany. Then in an extraordinary feat that astonished the West, in 1947 American ingenuity and innovation exfiltrated by Shumovsky made it possible to build and unveil the most advanced strategic bomber in the world.<br><br> Following his lead, other MIT-trained Soviet spies helped acquire the secrets of the Manhattan Project. By 1949, Stalin&#x2019;s fleet of TU-4s, now equipped with atomic bombs could devastate the US on his command. Appropriately codenamed BL�RIOT, Shumovsky was an aviation spy. Shumovsky&#x2019;s espionage was so successful that the USSR acquired every American aviation secret from his network of agents in factories and at top secret military research institutes.<br><br> In this thrilling history, Svetlana Lokhova takes the reader on a journey through Stalin&#x2019;s most audacious intelligence operation. She pieces together every aspect of Shumovsky&#x2019;s life and character using information derived from American and Russian archives, exposing how even Shirley Temple and Franklin D.

Barth&#x2019;s writing was not a response to the realistic fiction that characterized American literature at the time; it beckoned back to the founders of the novel: Cervantes, Rabelais, and Sterne, echoing their playfulness and reflecting the freedom inherent in the writing of fiction.</p> <p>This collection of Barth&#x2019;s short fiction is a landmark event, bringing all of his previous collections together in one volume for the first time. Its occasion helps readers assess a remarkable lifetime&#x2019;s work and represents an important chapter in the history of American literature. Dalkey Archive will reissue a number of Barth&#x2019;s novels over the next few years, preserving his work for generations to come.</p></p><p>John Barth is our most celebrated postmodernist. From the appearance in 1956 of <i>The Floating Opera</i>, his first published book, through the essay collection <i>Final Fridays</i>, released in 2012, he has published at least two books in each of the seven decades spanning his writerly life thus far. Thrice nominated for the National Book Award&#x2015;<i>The Floating Opera</i>, <i>Lost in the Funhouse</i>, and <i>Chimera</i>, which won in 1973&#x2015;Barth has received the F. Scott Fitzgerald Award for Outstanding Achievement in American Fiction, the PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in the Short Story, and the Lannan Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award. A native of Maryland&#x2019;s Eastern Shore, he taught for twenty-two years in the Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins University. He now lives in Florida with his wife Shelly.<p>Praise for the author: "Whether discussing modernism, postmodernism, semiotics, Homer, Cervantes, Borges, blue crabs or osprey nests, Barth demonstrates an enthusiasm for the life of the mind, a joy in thinking (and in expressing those thoughts) that becomes contagious" --Washington Post</p></p><h2>The Autobiography of Mark Twain (Perennial Classics)</h2><p><blockquote>"Mark Twain's autobiography is a classic of American letters, to be ranked with the autobiographies of Benjamin Franklin and Henry Adams.... It has the marks of greatness in it--style, scope, imagination, laughter, tragedy."</blockquote>--From the Introduction by Charles Neider<p>Mark Twain was a figure larger than fife: massive in talent, eruptive in temperament, unpredictable in his actions. He crafted stories of heroism, adventure, tragedy, and comedy that reflected the changing America of the time, and he tells his own story--which includes sixteen pages of photos--with the same flair he brought to his fiction. Writing this autobiography on his deathbed, Twain vowed to he "free and frank and unembarrassed" in the recounting of his life and his experiences.</p><p>Twain was more than a match for the expanding America of riverboats, gold rushes, and the vast westward movement, which provided the material for his novels and which served to inspire this beloved and uniquely American autobiography.</p></p><p>Mark Twain was a figure larger than life: massive in talent, eruptive in temperament, unpredictable in his actions.

Harlan is an artist and a writer with a poet's eye for the beauty of the world. Anna is a musician and an elegant master of the arts of graceful living. For seven years (1944-1951) the Hubbards make their home on their little boat, drifting with the river, camping on the land.<br><br>Together they learn how to create and sustain a self-sufficient way of life that is infinitely fulfilling. It is a "river way of life"&#x2015;free-flowing, endowed with the love of nature, the discovery of community, the rewards of good work, and the joy of creativity.<br><br>The journal is a witness to history, embracing the gentle spirit of an America now lost to modern "progress." It is one of the most significant renderings in our literature of a deeply felt sense of place.<br><br>Out of this journal grew Harlan Hubbard's enduring classic, <i>Shantyboat</i>, and his idyllic <i>Shantyboat on the Bayous</i>. His later <i>Payne Hollow</i> is a Thoreauvian testament to the values embodied in the homesteading life the Hubbards lived for four decades after they completed their epic river journey. Their life together has been praised by Wendell Berry as "one of the finest accomplishments of our time." The <i>Shantyboat Journal</i> reveals its creation.</p><p><b>Don Wallis</b> is a writer, teacher, and publisher of a country newspaper.

Reminiscent of Thoreau's work, but not as obtuse, they convey a pleasure in simplicity, adventure, and creativity, and an appreciation for the working men and women of the rivers."&#x2015;<i>Boating Books</i></p><h2>Samedi the Deafness (Vintage Contemporaries)</h2><p>One morning in the park James Sim discovers a man, crumpled on the ground, stabbed in the chest. In the man's last breath, he whispers his confession: <i>Samedi. </i><br><br>What follows is a spellbinding game of cat and mouse as James is abducted, brought to an asylum, and seduced by a woman in yellow. Who is lying? What is Samedi? And what will happen on the seventh day?</p><p><b>Jesse Ball</b> (1978-) was born in Long Island, the second child of Robert and Catherine Ball. Educated at Vassar College and Columbia University, he has lived at times in Europe, and has worked as an editor, a croupier, a tutor, and a photographer. His first volume, <i>March Book,</i> appeared in 2004, followed by <i>Vera &amp; Linus</i> (2006). His drawings were published in 2006 in Iceland in the volume <i>Og svo kom nottin</i>. Work of his has appeared in many major domestic and international journals, and was included in <i>Best American Poetry 2006</i>. <i>Jesse Ball was a Spy but has Retired to the Country</i>, a website, showcases much work of writing and drawing.<b>Day the first</b><br><br><b>James Sim rose on a Sunday morning</b><br><br>And dressed quietly in the dark. He did not switch on the light before descending the stairs. He did not put on the light in the hall.<br><br>&#x2014;I came in the front, he said beneath his breath. Best to leave by the side door.<br><br>It was early yet, and the clouds that had gathered near and made of themselves rain all through the night were now intent on going elsewhere. But it takes the minds of clouds a long time to effect their prodigious actions; the immediate result was solely a sort of paleness, a lightening of countenance.<br><br>At the nearest market, a balding man with an angry nose was crouched counting in the till. James bought from him a newspaper, folded it under his arm and continued. The change that James gave the man was put on the counter, separate from the business of counting that had been going on.<br><br>Is it too much to say that there was in James a small sadness for his change kept apart from the rest?<br><br>Sunday was always the best of days for being the self you had intended to be, but were not, for one or another reason. This was true most of all for those without families, those without friends. He thought, then: We of the mnemonist profession are always discrete in our ways. This pleased him. He said it aloud as he passed again into the morning as though entering some familiar hall.<br><br>&#x2014;Of course, we of the mnemonist profession are always discrete in our ways.<br><br>A boy of about eleven was on a footpath soon to join that of James. He looked up as James spoke. The footpaths were passing by a row of houses. In one, another boy was sitting on the edge of a dilapidated sand-box strewn with broken toys and faded color.<br><br>&#x2014;Farrell is a weakling! Farrell is a weak weak weakling! yelled the boy at James's side.<br><br>The boy in the yard looked up with pained recognition. Immediately he put his hands over his eyes and hid his face.<br><br>&#x2014;A weak weak weakling! A weakling! shouted the boy again.<br><br>&#x2014;Listen, you, said James, raising up the back of his hand.<br><br>But the first boy had already run off. He was mostly gone in fact. Boys change so quickly at that age, it was hard to say certainly that the boy away now beneath the trees was even the same one.<br><br>James continued. Behind him, the boy sitting in the yard was lost to sight. Is it crueler to be cruel when alone, or to be cruel in front of others?<br><br>When alone, perhaps.<br><br>That's why they say people who are cruel to animals should be punished so badly. For everyone's good. Not really for the animals.<br><br>James set the newspaper beside him on the bench. The park ran beneath a cliff that hung above a river. Three bridges crossed the air above, and it was his way to sit beneath the third of these on a bench upon a small outcrop of rock. Away to his right a field stretched.<br><br>Perhaps it was crueler to be cruel when in company.<br><br>Birds were diving back and forth between the limbs of trees, and an ephemeral greenness cast by the morning hung over the late-autumn park. He would have liked to tie strings to all the birds, to all the branches of trees, to all the whirling leaves and the swells upon the river, and pull with his hand, here and there, the glad enormity of morning, of that very Sunday morning. To take up in his hand the paths across which he had come, the boy running ahead upon the path, the boy behind, face covered, the bald shopkeeper with his regimented monies, the small door in the side of his house . . . But what then would he do with them?<br><br>A sort of shout came. James looked up. In the field, the figure of a man, bent over. James stood. The man shouted again, and lurched to the closeness of the ground. James looked about him. The park was empty. Leaving the newspaper, the bench, the path, he ran across the flatness of grass.<br><br>The man was lying in a crumpled fashion.<br><br>&#x2014;Are you all right?<br><br>The man turned on his side. His coat was open and the skin of the front of his body was like a rent and torn shirt. He must have been stabbed at least a half dozen times. James hesitated.<br><br>&#x2014;I'll fetch an ambulance.<br><br>The man made a painful sort of noise.<br><br>&#x2014;Did you see them? the man asked. Did you see them?<br><br>&#x2014;What? asked James.<br><br>&#x2014;They must have gone past you.<br><br>How could the man be alive? It must have happened within seconds. But where had the attackers gone?<br><br>The man was crouched in a way that James recognized. It was the manner of a dog that had been severely wounded by another dog in the presence of people and other dogs who all had done nothing to stop any of it. Furthermore, he, as such a dog, might feel sternly and clearly that any help soon to be forthcoming would be of no use to him, and that rather, perhaps, it were better that he be left alone, and certainly not looked at in this horrible manner.<br><br>&#x2014;I'm going to get an ambulance, said James.<br><br>&#x2014;There's no time for that, said the man, grimacing and puffing with his cheeks in an unpleasant way. I'll be dead before it comes. And what if they come back?<br><br>The man began to cough. James looked away at the river. Its surface was wet, and pierced with innumerable ripples and deformities. The liquid came up against the shore, leaving marks of wetness along the sand, along the bases of trees, upon everything it touched. It made him want to vomit.<br><br>&#x2014;That's no way to talk, said James.<br><br>He had put his hands into his pockets. He drew them out, but suddenly didn't know where to hold them. He put them back in again.<br><br>&#x2014;What's your name? he said.<br><br>He looked at his feet as he said this.<br><br>&#x2014;Thomas McHale, said the man. They've killed me.<br><br>&#x2014;Did they take anything of value? asked James.<br><br>&#x2014;That's useless, said Thomas McHale. That's useless to say to me.<br><br>He was quiet for a moment.<br><br>&#x2014;I was one of them, but I left, and they didn't want me to leave. Have you seen the paper? Samedi? The conspirators? I was one of them. I didn't have the stomach for it, and I left.<br><br>The man groaned and rolled onto his back. This prompted a fresh pulsing of the wounds; more blood issued forth out of his broken chest.<br><br>&#x2014;What's there to do? McHale groaned. You must do it. You must expose them.<br><br>James stood a few feet away, uncomfortably watching. He wanted none of this.<br><br>&#x2014;I don't know, he said. I don't know what you mean.<br><br>&#x2014;Listen, said McHale, there's no time.<br><br>He was wretched with his dying. James didn't want to look, but there is something hypnotic about such final speeches, and he listened even as his eyes slid along the filthiness of the river.<br><br>&#x2014;The man, the man in charge, Samedi, is tall and fat but carries it well, if you understand. A mole beneath his left eye, and he--<br><br>McHale broke off with a fit of coughing. Blood began to come out of his mouth.<br><br>&#x2014;He never goes out in public, or in the sun. His skin is pale. He is with a younger man, who dresses well, scornful, black hair, a childish face.<br><br>&#x2014;But how would I find them? asked James. What would be the point?<br><br>&#x2014;First, look for a man, Estrainger, his name is. He lives near the Chinese district. Poses as a playwright, but really he's an agent of . . . Samedi's. About fifty. Fifty or sixty. Gray hair. Small.<br><br>McHale's efforts were dwindling. He lay for a while, just breathing with his eyes closed. James decided to go for the ambulance. He started to move off, but McHale spoke again.<br><br>&#x2014;Another under the name of Sermon. Supposedly a psychologist. Young and conceited. Surrounds himself with women.<br><br>&#x2014;What's this Samedi's name? asked James. Who are these people?<br><br>&#x2014;It's useless, said McHale, it's useless.<br><br>He trailed off, mumbling.<br><br>&#x2014;They've ended me, ended me. I knew they would. I told Thomas. I told him they would; he put me away.<br><br>&#x2014;What are you saying? asked James. I don't understand.<br><br>&#x2014;The daughter, Grieve, said McHale. The handler, Torquin. Many of them in a house, I can't even say where. I was held there. I jumped the wall, ran for hours.<br><br>His speech trailed off again into a mumbling of names and phrases. James could not make them out. All around McHale the grass bore the deep stamp of his bleeding. His chest heaved and bucked and slowed. McHale was right&#x2014;there wouldn't have been time for an ambulance. But who was to blame? The thought came closer, became more definite. Whoever had done it must still be near.<br><br>James stood and looked hastily about him. No one was upon the meadow or on the near paths. He could see past the second bridge, but not all the way to the first. There were boats upon the river, but too far to make out figures. There were people on the bridge. None seemed to be watching, though in truth he couldn't tell.<br><br>The best thing to do, of course, was to leave immediately. This is what comes of going out for a walk in the morning. Anyone who leaves their house deserves what they get.<br><br>McHale was absent when James looked back; his body, unmoving, was now more a part of the ground than of the world itself.<br><br>I shouldn't stay, thought James. Again, he hesitated. He felt better now that the man could no longer demand anything of him. By being dead, he had made himself no longer James's business.<br><br>And so James hurried away, and when he had reached the street and boarded a bus, and ridden the bus for seven blocks, he felt much better, and for the next hour he pretended that none of it had happened.<br><br><b>The Hour After That</b><br><br>James bought a newspaper&#x2014;the first was still on the bench where he had left it.<br><br><b>AN ITEM IN THE NEWS:</b><br><br><b>QUESTIONS REMAIN OVER MAN'S SUICIDE OUTSIDE WHITE HOUSE</b><br><br>Washington, September 27: Federal authorities have commenced a probe into a suicide yesterday that occurred outside the White House gates.<br><br>According to eyewitnesses, at nine a.m., William Goshen, thirty-eight, a native of Washington and practicing psychologist, cut his own throat with a knife as he stood facing the White House. He was pronounced dead upon the arrival of paramedics.<br><br>The letter, which gives no addressee, was made public at an afternoon White House press conference:<br><br>SEVEN DAYS AND THEN THE ROD.

THOSE WHO CAN SHOULD NOW DO WHAT THEY WILL TO CHANGE THE WORLD AND LEAVE THEIR NATION IF THEY DO NOT LIKE WHAT IT DOES.<br><br>SEVEN DAYS, THEN. SEVEN DAYS AND THEN THE ROD.<br><br>SAMEDI<br><br>As of press time, authorities have few insights into the incident. The signature "Samedi" has returned no clues, and it is unclear whether the moniker refers to Goshen himself, or some other member of a possible organization. Despite exhaustive research, Goshen has not been linked to any terrorist groups or fringe religious organizations.<br><br>Goshen is survived by a wife, from whom he separated earlier this year, and a son, age nine.<br><br><b>A Few Minutes Passed, Then James</b><br><br>motioned with his hand. The waitress, sitting at the far end of the counter, rose and came over.<br><br>&#x2014;What'll it be, then?<br><br>Her mouth was pursed as she said this. She was of the sort who purse their mouths in order to defend themselves from a thing that people cannot defend themselves against. This undefined thing, this bleakness, arises much in those who work late at night in places lit by fluorescent lights, places attended by people who are strangers to each other and will always remain so.<br><br>&#x2014;More hot water for the tea. Also . . .<br><br>James tapped the menu above a particular item. In this way he made it clear that he preferred to be served rather than to speak. He prized such gestures, and kept them in a sort of wooden box. That is, he thought of them as being kept in a wooden box. It was his specialty, of course, to think of things in particular ways, and thus have hold of them whenever he should need to.<br><br><b>What Should Be Done</b><br><br>There was a pencil on the counter. James wrote on the back of a napkin:<br><br><i>What should be done?</i><br><br>Beneath it, he wrote:<br><br><i>nothing</i><br><br>This he crossed out. Beneath that:<br><br><i>tell someone, the police</i>.<br><br>He looked at the napkin. He felt then that there were two of them in the room, he and the napkin, and that one of them would have to go. He crumpled up the napkin.<br><br>The waitress came back. She had with her the specified items. James took them. He felt somehow that by placing them upon the counter in some way, a solution would unfold itself. He poured more hot water into his cup. Steam rose. That was good, he thought. Steam was good. It had often been a solution to problems. Why not now? The eggs and toast that he had ordered no longer interested him. He ate them methodically, looking up every now and then as one does in public places to see if anyone was watching him. Someone was.<br><br><b>Someone Was</b><br><br>a girl in a well-tailored yellow dress came over when their eyes met.<br><br>&#x2014;Say, James, she began.<br><br>&#x2014;I'm sorry, he said, do I know you?<br><br>Certainly he had never seen the girl before.<br><br>&#x2014;I shouldn't think so, she said.<br><br>Her face was framed by short black hair. She spoke with a thick accent. I will not marry you, thought James. You are not suitable at all. I don't like your yellow-dress. I don't like your hair-cut, and I don't like your approaching-of-men in public places. But, he was smiling.<br><br>&#x2014;You dropped this, I think.<br><br>She was holding James's wallet.<br><br>James took it from her. He examined the contents. Nothing was missing.<br><br>&#x2014;Nothing is missing, she said.<br><br>He took a long look at her.<br><br>&#x2014;How could you know that? he asked. Someone could have taken something before you found it.<br><br>&#x2014;Not true, she said. I saw you drop it, and then I picked it up.<br><br>&#x2014;When was this? James asked.<br><br>&#x2014;On the bus.<br><br>They looked at each other. James felt that he had been outmaneuvered. He did not like this feeling very much.</p><h2>The Essential Advantage: How to Win with a Capabilities-Driven Strategy</h2><p>Conventional wisdom on strategy is no longer a reliable guide.

When it is relevant to your ability to create value, it becomes the source of sustainable, superior returns. It&#x2019;s not what you have that matters; it&#x2019;s not what you sell; it&#x2019;s not even what you&#x2019;re known for. It&#x2019;s what you do, time and again, for the customers you serve.<br>Many businesses struggle along without a clearly realized, distinctive advantage of this sort, But a few seem to possess it to some noticeable degree. These are the companies whose people, from the top to the bottom of the hierarchy, seem to know what they are doing and why. These companies manage to set priorities among competing demands, unsentimentally cutting out operations and activities that don&#x2019;t fit, and yet they are gracious and responsible where it counts. When they enter a new market or launch a new product, they do so confidently, as if they have earned the right to win. They often seem one step ahead, outpacing competitors and anticipating just what their customers will want next, while making it all look natural. And their products and services are enviably profitable Even the atmosphere in their offices somehow conveys focus and clear thinking. (Yes, they make missteps but those are often quickly forgotten in the context of their overall success. They may even learn from them.) If you look closely at how they operate, you won&#x2019;t find any sign of the false distinction between strategy and execution that holds so many companies back.<br>These qualities are not random or anomalous. They stem directly from being coherent.<br>To most businesses, coherence simply means a requisite degree of shared resources and consensus. But to us, it is much more rigorous and specific. Coherence is resolute focus and clarity around the way a company creates value in the market. It created by bringing together three critical elements of strategy, the elements that set the direction for any commercial enterprise:<br> The way to play:&#x201d; a company&#x2019;s deliberately chosen way to create value in the market for its chosen customers.<br> The capability system:&#x201d; The integrated collection of processes and practices that a company deploys to fulfill its way to play.<br> The product and service fit:&#x201d; The portfolio of offerings that make good use of the capability system.<br>Only a coherent company one which has mastered this three-part balancing act is equipped to reliably, sustainably, outpace competitors. The essential advantage that results from this coherence is also linked, as we will see throughout this book, to higher effectiveness, superior economics, and sustained gains in financial performance, which together generate significant shareholder value.<br>In fact, we contend that, in most industries, coherence is the only route available for a company that wants to develop a right to win in its markets; the only way to create enduring value for shareholders and employees. The details of any company&#x2019;s coherence its preferred ways to play, capabilities, and portfolio of products and services -- will vary enormously from one company to the next, but the overall principle remains constant: Coherence is the only sustainable source of essential advantage.<br> Our core insight is that simple. Yet it is incredibly hard for companies to internalize and for external stakeholders (such as Wall Street) to support.<br>Most companies fail to pass the test of coherence. Their functional agendas and business priorities collide. Their growth emanates not from the core but the acquisition of apparent adjacencies&#x201d; and synergies&#x201d; that often turn out to be anything but adjacent or synergistic. When they cut costs which they must do more often than they should it is an across-the-board exercise rather than a considered reallocation of resources.<br>Although few companies are fully coherent, many companies thrive because they are relatively coherent, compared to their competitors. Once business people grasp the value of coherence (and the essential advantage it can provide them), they become far more effective than they had been before. And any company, no matter how difficult its industry or circumstances, can turn away from incoherence at any time.<br>The pursuit of essential advantage is powerfully rewarding. But it requires courage to make the necessary choices, and stamina and skill to execute them, even for the most experienced leaders. Above all, it requires continuous attention. Every choice a CEO or business manager will face, from M&amp;A decisions to organizational issues, will now be made from a coherence-related perspective.<br>Let&#x2019;s see what happens when a company takes on this challenge with a start-to-finish case study of the way a division of Pfizer gained essential advantage through a deliberate set of strategic decisions.<br></p><h2>Heartache Falls: An Eternity Springs Novel</h2><p><b>The healing magic of Eternity Springs continues in this novel in Emily March&#x2019;s vibrant series about a very special town and the people who need it most.<br> &nbsp;</b><br> Married for more than twenty years, and with her children out of the nest, Ali Timberlake has come to Eternity Springs alone.

Stereotypes of hillbillies and rednecks repeatedly appear in representations of the region, but few, if any, of its many heroes, visionaries, or innovators are ever referenced.<br><br>Make no mistake, they are legion: from Anne Royall, America's first female muckraker, to Sequoyah, a Cherokee mountaineer who invented the first syllabary in modern times, and international divas Nina Simone and Bessie Smith, as well as writers Cormac McCarthy, Edward Abbey, and Nobel Laureate Pearl S. Buck, Appalachia has contributed mightily to American culture &#x2014; and politics.

He was the founder of &#34;liberal theology&#34; with its emphasis on inner experience and the knowledge of God as mediated through history. This volume concentrates on the key texts and ideas in Schleiermacher&#39;s thought. It presents the essential Schleiermacher for students and the general reader. Keith Clements&#39;s introductory essay and notes on the selected texts set Schleiermacher in his historical context, chart the development of his thought and indicate the significance of this theology in the development of Christian theology as a whole. Substantial selections from Schleiermacher&#39;s work illustrate key themes: Religion as feeling and relationship The distinctiveness of Christianity: redemption through Jesus Christ The nature of theology as reflection and communication Hermeneutics: conversation with history God and the world The person and work of Christ Nation, Church and State Christianity and the religions</p><p>Friedrich Schleiermacher was an influencial German theologian and philosopher known for his impressive attempt to reconcile the criticisms of the Enlightenment with traditional Protestant orthodoxy.

Missouri&#x2019;s strategic access to important waterways made it a key site at the periphery of the Atlantic world. By the time of statehood in 1821, people were moving there in large numbers, especially from the upper South, hoping to replicate the slave society they&#x2019;d left behind.</p><p>Diane Mutti Burke focuses on the Missouri counties located along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers to investigate small-scale slavery at the level of the household and neighborhood. She examines such topics as small slaveholders&#x2019; child-rearing and fiscal strategies, the economics of slavery, relations between slaves and owners, the challenges faced by slave families, sociability among enslaved and free Missourians within rural neighborhoods, and the disintegration of slavery during the Civil War. Mutti Burke argues that economic and social factors gave Missouri slavery an especially intimate quality. Owners directly oversaw their slaves and lived in close proximity with them, sometimes in the same building. White Missourians believed this made for a milder version of bondage. Some slaves, who expressed fear of being sold further south, seemed to agree.</p><p>Mutti Burke reveals, however, that while small slaveholding created some advantages for slaves, it also made them more vulnerable to abuse and interference in their personal lives. In a region with easy access to the free states, the perception that slavery was threatened spawned white anxiety, which frequently led to violent reassertions of supremacy.</p></p><p>DIANE MUTTI BURKE is an assistant professor of history at the University of Missouri at Kansas City.<p>Mutti Burke provides a deeply researched and thorough account of slaveholding practices in Missouri, the first general study of slavery in that border state since Harrison Trexler's 1914 account . . . She weighs conflicting evidence to tell an important and neglected story in impressive fashion.</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p><i>On Slavery's Border</i> is an excellent and needed examination of how slavery functioned in yet another time and place. Burke further adds to our understanding of the differences inherent within slavery and how slavery adapted to fulfill the needs of both the enslaved and the enslavers.</p> (<i>Arkansas Historical Quarterly</i>)<br><br><p>Highly original and beautifully crafted, <i>On Slavery&#x2019;s Border</i> intervenes meaningfully and helpfully into some of the most important scholarly conversations about southern slavery. Mutti Burke tackles a region of the antebellum South rarely examined, and the dividends are rich. From her, we learn a great deal about the dynamics of slavery on small-slaveholding farms. This is a book that will be read with enormous profit by historians of the Old South specifically, of slavery generally.</p> (Mark M. Smith <i>author of <i>How Race is Made: Slavery, Segregation, and the Senses</i></i>)<br><br><p>Her work is by far the most thorough treatment of slavery in Missouri to date, and the exceptional nuance and detail she brings to her analysis of the master-slave relationship will make it one of the most informative of a short list of works on slavery on small farms and in border states.</p> (<i>H-CivWar </i>)<br><br><p><i>On Slavery&#x2019;s Border</i> considerably advances our understanding of the slave South(s). Taking seriously long-standing calls for greater attention to slavery in non-plantation areas, Mutti Burke paints an intimate portrait of slaveholding in a state where slaveholders of small means predominated. Showing what this meant for how slaves, slaveholders, and nonslaveholders related to each other, socialized, built communities, and constituted family and kin networks, this book expands and fundamentally alters the historiographical landscape. Here slaves commonly endured hiring out and abroad marriages and slaveholders just as commonly saw their sons put behind the plow; here slavery was at once intimate and intensely violently. As historians turn increasingly to the global and transnational dimensions of American slavery, <i>On Slavery&#x2019;s Border</i> reminds us of the continued importance of the local.</p> (Thavolia Glymph <i>author of <i>Out Of the House of Bondage: The Transformation of the Plantation Household</i></i>)<br><br><p><i>On Slavery&#x2019;s Border</i> tackles two important and understudied subjects: the history of slavery in the South&#x2019;s border states and the nature of small-scale slavery. It is full of original, interesting, and useful insight about many topics&#x2015;from the forced and voluntary migrations that created Missouri&#x2019;s patterns of slavery, to white gender ideologies that resembled those of the midwestern farming communities to the north and east, to the labor, leisure, and familial interactions that shaped the material and affective worlds of whites and African Americans. I am very enthusiastic about <i>On Slavery&#x2019;s Border</i> and expect that its audience will include historians of slavery and of the South; historians specializing in African American history, family history, and the study of women, gender, and sexuality; and, of course, both scholarly and popular readers interested in Missouri history.</p> (Leslie A.

Horowitz, Chess Editor of the New York Times and former U.S. Open Champion, applies some of the ideas and convictions acquired from thirty-five years of playing, teaching and analyzing the royal game. He emphasizes the tactical aspects of the game: how to recognize the big chance and hit hard when it occurs. He also stresses the ideas and methods in opening play, rather than the routine memorizing of variations that takes the joy out of chess for so many beginners. When you have completed this book, you will be able to play chess with pleasure and some ability.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>Basic Rules</b><br><br>Chess is played on a board of 64 squares. All the squares are used in the course of play.<br><br>The opponents ("White" and "Black") each have eight Pawns; a King; a Queen; two Bishops; two Knights; and two Rooks. Diagram 1 shows the opening position.<br><br>Note that the right-hand corner square in White's territory is always a <i>white</i> square.<br><br>White always moves first.<br><br><b>The King</b><br><br>The King can move one square in any direction. This is shown by the crosses in Diagram 2. Now, returning to Diagram 1, note how the King is placed in the center of the back row at the beginning of the game.<br><br>Ideally, the King can move to eight different squares. But in chess you cannot move to a square occupied by one of your own men. So that, for example, if five of the King's possible squares are occupied by his own pieces, he has only three feasible moves left.<br><br>Capturing hostile pieces is accomplished by displacing them. The King captures pieces which are within his moving range.<br><br>For reasons that will become clear later, <i>the King is the most important piece in chess!</i><br><br><b>The Rook</b><br><br>The Rook moves horizontally or vertically. In diagram 5 the Rook has its maximum 14 possible moves. The Rook cannot displace or leap over any of its own men. It can capture enemy pieces which are within its moving range. The Rook can move in only one direction at a time.<br><br><b>The Bishop</b><br><br>The Bishop moves along squares of the same color. Each player has one Bishop which moves on white squares, and one which moves on black squares. The Bishop can move in only one direction at a time. He cannot displace or leap over any of his own pieces. He can capture any enemy force within his moving range.<br><br><b>The Queen</b><br><br>The Queen, by far the most powerful piece on the chessboard, has the powers of the Rook AND the Bishop. But, like those pieces, it can move in only one direction at a time.<br><br>In Diagram 13, we see that the Queen ideally has 27 possible moves at its disposal. The Queen cannot displace or leap over any of its own pieces. She can capture any enemy piece within her moving range.<br><br><b>The Knight</b><br><br>The Knight's move is always of the same length. See Diagram 17.<br><br>You can see that the Knight's move is in the form of a capital "L."<br><br>The Knight's move has been well described:<br><br>(a) one square "North" OR "South"; then two squares "East" OR "West."<br><br>(b) one square "East" OR "West"; then two squares "North" OR "South."<br><br>Either description can be used to describe the same move! Try it.<br><br>Note that the Knight changes the color of his square each time he moves. Thus, in Diagram 17 he starts out on a black square. But in Diagram 18, having made his move, he ends up on a white square.<br><br>Unlike the other pieces, the Knight can leap over his own men and those of the enemy. He can capture enemy pieces only at the end-square of his move.<br><br><b>The Pawn</b><br><br>The Pawn is the only one of the chessmen that does not move backward. <i>The Pawn can only move forward.</i><br><br>As you have seen from Diagrams 23-24, the Pawn can move forward one square at a time. The same is true of Black Pawns, which, however, move in the <i>opposite</i> direction. This is shown in Diagrams 25-26 (page 8).<br><br>There is one exception to the rule that the Pawn moves <i>one</i> square straight ahead. When the Pawn is making its first move, it has the <i>option</i> of advancing one square OR two.<br><br>At the beginning of the game (see Diagram 1), the Pawns are all lined up on the second row. (Such horizontal rows of squares are known as <i>ranks.)</i> Any Pawn on the second rank, no matter how far the game has progressed, has the choice of advancing one or two squares (Diagrams 27-30).<br><br>Still another peculiarity of the Pawn is that it <i>captures in a different way</i> from the one in which it moves. It captures one square forward to the right OR left (Diagrams 31-34).<br><br>In other words, the Pawn's capture is a limited application of the Bishop's capture (page 4). The Pawn's method of capture, as you will see later on, plays an important role.<br><br>Copyright 1950 by I. A.

This unusual book enables children to carry out more than 103 different experiments and demonstrations, carefully planned to illustrate principles of modern science. Clear step-by-step instructions, frequent diagrams, and clear statements of conclusions all enable the young student to carry through these experiments with minimal supervision, yet full success.<br>The science projects included demonstrate what things are made of and how substances are affected by the different forms of energy, heat, light, sound, mechanical energy, electricity, and magnetism. The experiments show how a thermometer measures temperature, how an electric bulb gives light, how shadows are formed, how a stethoscope works, how to make a periscope, how to make a rainbow, how straws work, how water changes size, and many other fascinating facts. Little is required in the way of equipment other than simple materials found at home, such as bottles, cardboard, wire, nails, cork, paper, and magnets.<br>This volume offers upper grade school, junior high school, and high school students a very entertaining way to enrich their background in science and its applications. It is also a very valuable aid to parents, teachers, and others who wish to make clear, forceful demonstrations to children.</p><p></p><h2>On the Eternity of the World [De Aeternitate Mundi] (Medieval Philosophical Texts in Translation, No. 16)</h2><p>Book by St. Thomas Aquinas, Siger of Brabant, St. Bonaventure</p><p></p><h2>Jungle Laboratories: Mexican Peasants, National Projects, and the Making of the Pill</h2><p>In the 1940s chemists discovered that <i>barbasco</i>, a wild yam indigenous to Mexico, could be used to mass-produce synthetic steroid hormones. Barbasco spurred the development of new drugs, including cortisone and the first viable oral contraceptives, and positioned Mexico as a major player in the global pharmaceutical industry. Yet few people today are aware of Mexico&#x2019;s role in achieving these advances in modern medicine. In <i>Jungle Laboratories</i>, Gabriela Soto Laveaga reconstructs the story of how rural yam pickers, international pharmaceutical companies, and the Mexican state collaborated and collided over the barbasco. By so doing, she sheds important light on a crucial period in Mexican history and challenges us to reconsider who can produce science.<p></p><p>Soto Laveaga traces the political, economic, and scientific development of the global barbasco industry from its emergence in the 1940s, through its appropriation by a populist Mexican state in 1970, to its obsolescence in the mid-1990s. She focuses primarily on the rural southern region of Tuxtepec, Oaxaca, where the yam grew most freely and where scientists relied on local, indigenous knowledge to cultivate and harvest the plant. Rural Mexicans, at first unaware of the pharmaceutical and financial value of barbasco, later acquired and deployed scientific knowledge to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies, lobby the Mexican government, and ultimately transform how urban Mexicans perceived them. By illuminating how the yam made its way from the jungles of Mexico, to domestic and foreign scientific laboratories where it was transformed into pills, to the medicine cabinets of millions of women across the globe, <i>Jungle Laboratories</i> urges us to recognize the ways that Mexican peasants attained social and political legitimacy in the twentieth century, and positions Latin America as a major producer of scientific knowledge.<br></p></p><p>&#34;In this innovative and compelling book, Gabriela Soto Laveaga links together a host of phenomena crying out for attachment. &#34;Jungle Laboratories &#34;brings bioprospecting into conversation with Mexican nationalism; makes pharmaceutical development connect with campesinos striving for recognition as citizens and experts; locates the conjunction of contemporary bioscience and Latin American modernity; and finds the overgrown intersection of steroids and magical thinking--thereby giving us a ground-breaking postcolonial study of the roots of global biomedicine.&#34;--Warwick Anderson, author of &#34;Colonial Pathologies: American Tropical Medicine, Race, and Hygiene in the Philippines&#34;<p>Gabriela Soto Laveaga is Professor of the History of Science at Harvard University.</p></p><h2>Selected Poetry and Prose</h2><p><p><strong>The essential work of Mallarm�, collected in a bilingual French and English edition.&nbsp;</strong></p> Selected Poetry and Prose&nbsp;of St�phane Mallarm� presents what can be considered the essential work of the renowned &#x201c;father of the Symbolists.&#x201d; Mallarm�&#x2019;s major elegies, sonnets, and other verse, including excerpts from the dialogue &#x201c;H�riodiade,&#x201d; are all assembled here with the French and English texts en face.

The fellas is gettin&#x2019; fidgety. They all wanna get the packet sent off, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>Mack Cleveland paused in scooping nails into the scale&#x2019;s bowl and sent a scowl across the counter to Spiveyville&#x2019;s postman. The man&#x2019;s grin, mostly hidden behind his overgrown mustache and beard, seemed to taunt Mack. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t I make myself clear the other night? I think it&#x2019;s a fool notion, and I want no part of it.&#x201d;</p><p>Clive Ackley&#x2019;s thick eyebrows shot upward, forming a pair of fuzzy black tepees above his watery brown eyes. &#x201c;You still takin&#x2019; that stand? Figured by now you&#x2019;d come around, seein&#x2019; how every other man in town voted yes.&#x201d;</p><p>Mack bit back an argument. Not every man in town attended the meeting. And the preacher hadn&#x2019;t voted yes. But Preacher Doan&#x2019;s vote didn&#x2019;t count because he already had a wife. Mack gave Clive an up-and-down look, taking in the scraggly beard dribbling across his chest and his rumpled checked shirt stretched over his round belly. &#x201c;Are you sending a letter?&#x201d;</p><p>Clive jammed his hands into his trouser pockets and rocked back on his heels. &#x201c;You can bet your buttons I&#x2019;m sendin&#x2019; one.&#x201d; He laughed as if he&#x2019;d made a joke. The scruffy facial hair couldn&#x2019;t quite mask a gap where a back tooth used to be or the tobacco bits caught between front teeth. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t hardly wait to meet up with the gal who&#x2019;ll be Mrs. Clive Ackley.&#x201d;</p><p>Mack hoped whoever arrived to claim the title would have eyesight as poor as Clive&#x2019;s or she might run screaming for the Pratt Center depot when she got a good look at her prospective groom. Mack dropped another clattering half scoop of nails into the tin bowl and examined the scale. Two ounces past a pound. He pinched off a few nails, and the needle jiggled a smidgen past the one. Close enough.</p><p>He lifted the bowl and poured the nails into a paper bag. After rolling the top down tight, he held the bag to Clive. &#x201c;There you are.&#x201d;</p><p>The man kept his hands in his trouser pockets. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re makin&#x2019; a mistake not addin&#x2019; your letter to the packet.&#x201d;</p><p>Mack plopped the bag on the counter and gave it a little shove toward the postman. &#x201c;Do you want these nails or not?&#x201d;</p><p>Clive grabbed the bag, curling his sausage-shaped fingers around the rolled edge. He pointed at Mack with the lumpy bag. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna be wishin&#x2019; you done somethin&#x2019; differ&#x2019;nt when every fella in town except you is sayin&#x2019; his vows in front of Preacher Doan.&#x201d;</p><p>Mack brushed bits of iron shavings from the counter and ground them into the planked floor with the sole of his boot. In his opinion, the ones wishing they&#x2019;d chosen different would be all those men who trusted a matchmaker from Newton, Massachusetts, to find them wives instead of relying on the Good Lord&#x2019;s guidance. But he&#x2019;d said all that at the town meeting and nobody&#x2019;d listened to him, the same way Uncle Ray hadn&#x2019;t listened to Ma and Pa, so what was the sense of repeating it?</p><p>&#x201c;Go ahead and send those letters, Clive. I hope it works out good for all of you.&#x201d;</p><p>Clive shook his head, glaring at Mack in disgust, but he ambled out of the building without another argument.</p><p>Mack grabbed the broom from its spot in the corner and set to work, smacking the straw bristles against the floor with more force than needed to clear the wide planks of dust. Sweat dribbled down his temples and dripped off his chin, leaving little splotches on the floor that quickly dried in the hot wind coursing through the open front door and wheezing out the back. If he didn&#x2019;t slow down, he might give himself heatstroke, but he had to channel his concerns somewhere, and the floor seemed a safe target.</p><p>Why wouldn&#x2019;t the men in town listen to reason? Buying a bride was foolhardy. Maybe even dangerous. The fellows in Spiveyville might not be the smartest men in the state of Kansas, but they were, for the most part, an honest lot. How could they know for sure the women who came at their request were honest? Could any woman who would make herself available to travel to a town she&#x2019;d never visited and marry a man sight unseen be one a decent man would want to wed? Not likely.</p><p>Some of these women could be trying to escape the law. Maybe they were women of ill repute. And the men of Spiveyville planned to send their letters and hard-earned money to a matchmaker states away without any guarantee they&#x2019;d end up with a bride. Why would they be so reckless?</p><p>Mack leaned against the broom&#x2019;s handle and sighed. He knew why. Because they were lonely. The same way Uncle Ray had been lonely. Truth be told, Mack was, too. His thirty-first birthday had passed a month ago, and he&#x2019;d operated Spiveyville Hardware and Implements on his own for coming up on ten years. He wanted companionship&#x2014;a family&#x2014;as much as any other man his age did.</p><p>But lonely was one thing. Desperate was another. Gritting his teeth, he put the broom to work again. Every other unmarried man in Spiveyville could participate in the scheme, but he wanted nothing to do with any mail-order bride.</p><p><br><br>Mid-October 1888</p><p>Newton, Massachusetts</p><p>Abigail Grant</p><p>Abigail drew in a deep breath, allowed it a slow escape through her puckered lips, and finally reached for the doorknob. She gave the oval etched-glass knob a twist and pushed, pasting on a smile as the door opened on silent hinges.</p><p>Mrs. Helena Bingham&#x2019;s gaze lifted from an open ledger on the polished top of the French Empire desk and settled on Abigail. Disappointment instantly sagged her lined face. &#x201c;Here you are again.&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail lifted her chin even though her pulse thrummed in an erratic beat. She dropped her valise next to the doorway and crossed the cabbage-rose carpet, the fraying hem of her deep-russet skirt grazing the thick fibers. &#x201c;I assure you, there was no other choice. The situation there was&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Bingham held up one hand, reminiscent of a courtroom judge. &#x201c;Let me guess. Deplorable.&#x201d; She raised her snow-white brows. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail pursed her lips. The woman needn&#x2019;t use such a sarcastic tone. She tugged her little travel hat from her head and dropped it on the desk. A wavy strand of hair&#x2014;defined as &#x201c;mink brown&#x201d; on her summary sheet&#x2014;slid along her cheek, and she pushed it behind her ear with an impatient thrust. &#x201c;Completely so. A creek for water, a dirt floor&#x2014;dirt!&#x2014;and a sod roof. Spiders descended onto the table during dinner.&#x201d; She shuddered. &#x201c;The place wasn&#x2019;t fit for animals, let alone humans.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Bingham closed her eyes for a moment. When she opened them, the disapproval glimmering in her pale-gray irises pierced Abigail to the core of her being. &#x201c;Abigail, Abigail, what am I to do with you?&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail rested her fingertips on the edge of the desk. &#x201c;Stop sending me to these barbaric locations for which I am woefully unsuited.&#x201d; She shifted her attention to the stack of applications resting in a delicate wire basket on the corner of the desk. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there at least one request from a gentleman?&#x201d;</p><p>Even as she uttered the question, her heart divulged the sad truth. No gentlemen of prominent backgrounds relied upon a matchmaker to secure a bride. Their families and close friends guided them toward equally prominent prospects. At one time, she was considered a fine catch. But her family&#x2019;s tumble from the social registers as a result of Father&#x2019;s illegal dealings sealed her fate. She hung her head, bracing herself for Mrs. Bingham&#x2019;s response.</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps you aren&#x2019;t suited to matrimony at all.&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail jerked, meeting the older woman&#x2019;s unsmiling gaze. &#x201c;N-not suited to...&#x201d; After three years of harboring Abigail beneath her roof, had the matchmaker not learned how much Abigail&#x2019;s heart yearned for a husband and family of her own? Why, even the Bible&#x2014;what Mrs. Bingham herself declared God&#x2019;s holy Word!&#x2014;spoke of the wisdom of every man having his own wife, and every wife her own husband.</p><p>Abigail sank slowly onto the padded seat of the side chair near the desk and gaped at the older woman through a veil of tears. &#x201c;How can you say such a hurtful thing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sometimes being truthful requires one to be hurtful.&#x201d; Mrs. Bingham&#x2019;s pale eyes held a hint of regret, but her lips formed a grim line. &#x201c;How many times have you traveled to meet a prospective groom and returned dissatisfied?&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail blinked rapidly. &#x201c;I, um, I...don&#x2019;t recall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Six times.&#x201d; Mrs. Bingham aimed a barbed look across the desk and steepled her hands on the ledger. &#x201c;The first time, you claimed the house was too small and was without a cooking stove. The second time, the prospective groom had rotten teeth and bad breath. The third time, the distance from town was too great and you felt insecure. The fourth time, you said you couldn&#x2019;t possibly marry a man with such a short stature. The fifth time, the town itself had no apothecary or millinery shops&#x2014;how could you survive in such a barren place? Now, this time, the reason is a dirt floor, sod roof, and spiders descending during meals.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you had seen the decrepit dwelling, you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Abigail, you aren&#x2019;t fooling anyone. Not even, I daresay, yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail lifted her chin and narrowed her gaze. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Bingham reached into a desk drawer and withdrew a small square piece of paper. She waved it gently. &#x201c;I received this telegram three days ago. The same day you boarded the train for the return to Newton.&#x201d;</p><p>Perspiration broke over Abigail&#x2019;s frame.</p><p>&#x201c;Shall I read it to you?&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail wanted to refuse. She wanted to escape. But her tongue stuck to the roof of her dry mouth. Her quivering limbs resisted supporting her weight.</p><p>Mrs. Bingham slipped a pair of wire spectacles into place and angled the page toward the lamplight. &#x201c;&#x2018;Sending her back. Too hoity-toity. Give me refund or new girl.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Humiliation swept through Abigail, searing her from the inside out. Had others sent similar messages? First rejected by young men from her rightful social class for her father&#x2019;s sins, and then rejected by unworthy suitors for having manners too refined. Where would she find her place of belonging? The ache for a home and family of her own engulfed her and brought the desire to cry. But she sniffed hard, blinked away the moisture gathering in her eyes, and held her chin at a regal angle, the way Mother had taught her.</p><p>Mrs. Bingham flipped the telegram into the basket and pinned Abigail with a stern glare. &#x201c;Tell me the truth. Whose decision was it for you to return to Newton&#x2014;yours or his?&#x201d;</p><p>She patted her forehead with the back of her gloved hand. &#x201c;Well, I... He...&#x201d; She swallowed and gripped her hands in her lap. &#x201c;I suppose it was mutual.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mmm-hmm.&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail leaned forward slightly, beseeching the matchmaker with her eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a city girl, Mrs. Bingham. Send me to Boston, or New York, or even Philadelphia. I&#x2019;m certain all will be fine if you&#x2019;ll only match me with someone of similar background and breeding.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Bingham released a heavy sigh. &#x201c;The description on the telegram&#x2014;&#x2018;hoity-toity&#x2019;&#x2014;is far too accurate, and it is your biggest detriment to finding a match.&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail hung her head, blinking back tears. How could refined manners be considered a detriment? Her earliest, most cherished memories were of tea parties with her dear mother, who patiently taught her how to use silverware, to pat rather than swipe her lips after small bites of pastries or sips of tea, to utilize proper speech and decorum. Now, with Mother gone, all that remained were memories and the refinement she&#x2019;d learned from her gentle mother. Was she to discard these last bits of her former life for the sake of matrimony? Abigail forced aside her thoughts and focused on Mrs. Bingham&#x2019;s stern reprimand.</p><p>&#x201c;My clients are down-to-earth, hardworking, responsible men who are seeking down-to-earth, hardworking, responsible women with whom to build a lifelong relationship. Sending you to a city will not solve the problem, because you will take your snooty airs, fastidious manners, and unrealistic expectations with you.&#x201d; She raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tried my hardest, but half a dozen failures is six too many for this business. If I continue to accept money for a match that cannot possibly succeed, you&#x2019;ll damage my reputation as a matchmaker.&#x201d;</p><p>She glanced toward the door, where Abigail&#x2019;s carpetbag sat plump with all her earthly belongings. &#x201c;Your bag is still packed. Do not unpack it. Instead, take it and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail leaped from the chair. She clasped her hands beneath her chin, shamed by her behavior yet too desperate to do otherwise. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t remove me from your list of brides. Give me one more chance. I promise it will be different this time if you&#x2019;ll allow me one more opportunity.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Bingham rose and rounded the desk, determination etched into her features. &#x201c;I intend to give you one more opportunity. It&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail caught the woman&#x2019;s hands and held tight. &#x201c;Oh, thank you, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Bingham withdrew her hands. &#x201c;Will you kindly remain silent long enough for me to finish speaking?&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail whisked her hands behind her back and closed her lips. But her chest rose and fell in rapid heaves of breath she couldn&#x2019;t seem to control. Oh, why had Father chosen such an unsavory path? Maybe it would have been better if she had died of a broken heart as Mother had. At least she&#x2019;d be spared the abject indignity of begging.</p><p>Mrs. Bingham sorted through a file on her desk and removed a fat envelope. She held it in front of her like a shield. &#x201c;This envelope, sent by men from a small town in Kansas, contains sixteen written requests for brides.&#x201d;</p><p>Hope fluttered to life in Abigail&#x2019;s breast. Surely out of sixteen men, there would be one acceptable candidate for her hand.</p><p>&#x201c;If the placement fees hadn&#x2019;t been included, I would have discarded the entire lot. The letters...&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s face pursed. &#x201c;Suffice it to say, many of the writers of these missives are sorely lacking in the social niceties.&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail bit the inside of her lip. The hope began to fizzle.</p><p>&#x201c;But sixteen requests... As a good businesswoman, I cannot reject the potential income. Thus, I have been striving to secure matches for each of these men.&#x201d;<br></p></p><h2>Ernest Gimson: Arts &amp; Crafts Designer and Architect</h2><p><b>An authoritative and insightful study, surveying the life and work of &#x201c;the greatest of the English artist-craftsmen&#x201d;</b><br><br> This study of the renowned designer-maker Ernest Gimson (1864&#x2013;1919) combines biography with analysis of his work as an architect and designer of furniture, metalwork, plaster decoration, embroidery, and more.

It has been read and reread in every generation, in every Jewish community. Now, for the first time, Ismar Elbogen&#39;s Jewish Liturgy: A Comprehensive History, the most complete scholarly study of Jewish liturgy in existence today, is available to the English-speaking community. Originally published in German, the work was reissued in an updated Hebrew version in 1972. It has now been masterfully translated from the German and the Hebrew by Raymond P. Scheindlin. Elbogen&#39;s analysis covers the entire range of Jewish liturgical development - beginning with the early cornerstones of the siddur, such as the Amidah, the Shema, and Ashrei, through the evolution of the medieval piyyut tradition, to modern prayerbook reform in Germany and the United States. The book traces the origins of present-day prayers, noting the many variants that arose within historical periods and different geographic communities. Elbogen includes generous citations from primary sources such as rabbinic texts, comparative historical documents, medieval commentators, and modern scholarship. The work is complemented by a study of the history of the synagogue as an institution; its functionaries, architecture, and music. Also included are full bibliographies and several useful indexes, among them an index of prayers in Hebrew and English. Elbogen&#39;s studies will prove invaluable to Jewish scholars because of the presentation of primary sources and variants, to interested laypersons because of his comprehensive overview and systematic format, and to Christian scholars because of hisattention to parallel developments in Christian liturgy. Eighty years after its first appearance, Elbogen&#39;s magisterial work remains the most thorough academic study of the Jewish liturgy ever written. It is a monument to the historical and philological approach that characterized Jewish studies - and humanistic studies generally - in the second half of the nineteenth century.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Walking Where Jesus Walked: Worship in Fourth-Century Jerusalem (Calvin Institute of Christian Worship Liturgical Studies)</h2><p><br><br> The Church at Worship is a series of documentary case studies of specific worshiping communities from around the world and throughout Christian history.

Why, then, did the Roman Catholic Church feel obliged to almost entirely erase this female figure and her role? Was it because of a now proven anti-feminism that existed at the heart of the Church from the early Middle Ages? The Christian conception of femininity, which has certainly greatly evolved in the modern world, especially since the council of Vatican II, is due both to Greco-Roman legacy and to the Hebraic options. With the exception of the female characters of Genesis, who are gripping figures to say the least, the scribes of the Bible lowered the status of Woman by making her impure and thus not apt, for example, to play a sacerdotal role. The idea that Mary Magdalene enjoyed total equality with the apostles has never crossed the minds of Church theologians. Because priests are the legitimate heirs of the apostles, such a standing would make Mary Magdalene, on the one hand, a priestess--how horrible!--and on the other, one of those on whom the apostolic sacerdotal filiation was founded. <br> <br>Yet, when Mary of Bethany washes Jesus&#x2019; feet and anoints him with precious perfume, which Judas, the group&#x2019;s treasurer, believes could be put to a more profitable use, she and Jesus are enacting a kind of sacerdotal and royal ordination--with Mary serving as the priestess who performs the ritual. <br> <br>Is it forbidden to think that Mary of Bethany, over the course of those long moments spent at the feet of the Lord, could have heard what he had to say or at least sensed the full scope of Christ&#x2019;s mystery even if she did not grasp it in its entirety? Jesus persistently tried to lead his disciples to realize this--if only in the &#x98ec;at of the Transfiguration!--but their hearts remained curiously closed all the way to the end. Mary, however, did perceive and accept it. On that day she knew the moment had come to manifest this mystery in chiaroscuro. In a kind of prophetic intuition . . . Mary anointed the head of Jesus, recognizing and presenting him as King and Priest, and anointed his feet as Messiah sent from God. <br> <br>Such a presentation obviously involves a rite of enthronement that can be performed only by a person vested symbolically with sacerdotal powers. Jesus was fully aware of this when he answered Martha&#x2019;s reproaches by saying that Mary &#x201c;had the best part.&#x201d; <br> <br>At that time there were two sites named Bethany: a town two miles east of Jerusalem, where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived; and on the left bank of the Jordan, at a ford just before the Dead Sea, where John the Baptist baptized. In addition, there was a place called Bethabara, &#x201c;house of passage,&#x201d; by the gates to the desert. John the Baptist and later Mary, each in their own way, granted baptism, initiation, the right of passage, or the means of crossing the threshold. The two Bethanys, then, seem to mirror each other. Magdalene extends the echo of her precursor, John the Baptist. One is a man clad in hides and the other is a woman clad in her long mane of hair. The chief difference between them is that John remains in a harsh and terrible place, screaming in Essenian rigor his curses and his calls to repent, whereas Mary in Bethany, on the opposite where all is blooming and gay, speaks of love and forgiveness and the transition from one world to the next. While Jesus received from John a baptism in water, he did not receive, as the ancient kings had, a consecrating anointing with oil. Just before his Passion and &#x201c;baptism by spirit and fire&#x201d;--the crucifixion--he received the perfumed oil from the female Magdalene. The old and ancient notion of the priest-king applies to Jesus, but this royal unction, let me repeat, can only be performed by a priest--or priestess. <br> <br>The unction in Bethany is surely one of the most important events in the life of Jesus. Furthermore, this is what Jesus himself says to his disciples who are always more or less hostile toward the whims of Woman: He declares to them that this woman truly did &#x201c;what she had to do,&#x201d; and even adds, according to Mark 14:9, &#x201c;In truth, I declare to you, everywhere the Gospel is to be spread, throughout the whole world, one will also recount, in memory of her, the deed she has done.&#x201d; This is acknowledgment of an uncommon power possessed by Mary that went far beyond a mere gesture of female vanity, which is clearly what the first disciples thought it to be, and underscores the importance Magdalene was given in the very words of Jesus. <br> <br>Why, then, was Mary Magdalene relegated to such a minor role in the evangelical tradition as revised and corrected by the Church Fathers? Is the Christian sacerdotal class ashamed to owe so much to a woman? <br> <br>And I cannot forbear from asking myself: what has the memory of the Church done to these words of Jesus? Isn&#x2019;t there something yet to be explored there? And wouldn&#x2019;t this something be the consecration of a specifically female ministry of a prophetic and charismatic nature that Jesus would himself have recognized and proclaimed as existing in tandem with the apostolic and sacerdotal ministry? What a unique place woman would hold in the very heart of the Church if this was the case! <br> <br>The question certainly has been raised--and it seems that Abbe Sauni&#x8ca5; may have answered it in his own way in the church of Rennes-le-Chateau.</p><h2>As A Woman Thinketh</h2><p>A woman only begins to be a woman when she ceases to whine and revile, and commences to search for the hidden justice which regulates her life. And as she adapts her mind to that regulating factor, she ceases to accuse others as the cause of her condition, and builds herself up in strong and noble thoughts.</p><p>The original version of this book - As a Man Thinketh - is the classic James Allen volume that has inspired millions around the world to change their lives for the better. In this marvelous essay, Allen offers the means to gain confidence in yourself, to take charge of the way you think about things, and to reshape yourself to meet and conquer the challenges in your life. This special women&#x2019;s edition is a wonderful rewrite dedicated to helping women find their inner beauty and light. James Allen was born in Leicester, England, in 1864.

At age thirty-eight, he wrote From Poverty to Power, one of the first motivational books ever written. His next book, As a Man Thinketh, established his reputation as an inspirational writer.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

She lives in Chicago with her husband, Brett Nolan, and a rather giant cat named Roy.</strong></p> <p><strong>Gillian Flynn: </strong>Writers imbue their characters with a little bit of themselves. Obviously, Sylvie Mason is very different from you. How did you find a window into Sylvie?</p> <p><strong>John Searles:</strong> I joke that, deep down, I&#x2019;m really a teenage girl. Growing up, my dad worked as a cross-country truck-driver and my brother was usually off with his friends, so my mom, my sisters and I spent were always together. As an adult, I become an editor at a women&#x2019;s magazine. So in a weird way, it was almost easier for me to write from a female perspective.</p> <p><strong>GF: </strong>You&#x2019;ve talked before about how your sister&#x2019;s death affected your writing. How so in this book?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> After my sister, Shannon, died, my parents divorced and I left for New York to try and become a writer. Our youngest sister, Keri, was left behind. Keri was around the age of Sylvie, and I realized while writing the book that I was channeling her emotions from that time. She was so young to be faced with tragedy, but like Sylvie, had a resilient spirit.</p> <p><strong>GF: </strong><em>Help for the Haunted</em> has some seriously scary moments and delves into the subculture of haunted souls and paranormalists. What inspired you?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> As a kid, I was obsessed with scary things. I made haunted houses in our garage, and when I got my license, I used to load my friends into my station wagon and drive us down a dirt road at night, where I&#x2019;d try to scare the hell out of them. </p> <p>Also, I grew up in the same town as the couple who inspired &#x201c;The Conjuring.&#x201d; Seeing them in church used to frighten me! Years later, I saw the woman at library event, and I wondered what it would be like if Sylvie&#x2019;s parents dealt with the paranormal too. </p> <p><strong>GF: </strong>Do you believe in the supernatural? </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong>In <em>Help For the Haunted</em>, Sylvie says, &#x201c;I do and I don&#x2019;t believe.&#x201d; Her mix of feelings is like my own. Logically, I know better, but then life serves up something unexplainable and I can&#x2019;t help but believe again.</p> <p><strong>GF: </strong>How do you think you&#x2019;ve grown as a writer over the course of your career?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong>I&#x2019;ve always tried to take risks with my writing, but in Help for the Haunted, I took more: writing from a girl&#x2019;s perspective, combining a murder mystery with a coming of age tale, playing with time and the supernatural. I used to ask my editor, &#x201c;Is this story too weird?&#x201d; Thankfully, she always told me to keep going.</p> <p><strong>GF:</strong> Did you begin <em>Help for the Haunted</em> knowing what was going to happen?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> All I had was the voice of a girl left in the care of her tough older sister. The rest came in pieces. The old Tudor where the family lives was inspired by an old Tudor where I stayed at Yaddo. The sisters&#x2019; job doing surveys was one I had in high school. The doll came when I discovered Raggedy Ann dolls in my mother&#x2019;s attic. I forgot she once made them until they were staring me in the face&#x2014;and scaring me!&#x2014; once more.</p> <p><strong>GF:</strong> Lots of writers have quirky writing habits. What are yours?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Lying on the floor and staring at the ceiling. Push-ups. Runs. Baths. When I go into a writing jag, I don&#x2019;t change my clothes, shower or shave. While revising <em>Help for the Haunted</em>, I took a break and stumbled into a restaurant. All of New York City and who sits down next to me, but Jay McInerney. He looked at me with my greasy bedhead and rumpled clothes, and I swear he was about to say, &#x201c;The soup kitchen is down the street.&#x201d;</p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, September 2013:</strong> Late one snowy night, Sylvie Mason hears her parents talking on the phone. A little later, they drive with Sylvie to a church, where--as Sylvie sleeps in the car--they are murdered in the church&#x2019;s basement. The question of who killed Sylvie&#x2019;s parents is only the first of many mysteries that unfold in John Searles&#x2019; <em>Help for the Haunted</em>, an expertly-wrought, coming-of-age story with a healthy dose of creepiness. Searles takes his time introducing us to his characters--Sylvie, her older sister Rose, their demonologist parents, and a handful of suspects--but in a very calibrated way, he doles out chills and family secrets that heighten the tension with each turn of the page. The chills deliver, but the depth of the story is what really sets this book apart. <em>Your parents are never gone from you</em>... Sylvie remembers her father saying. And for some, that&#x2019;s just another way of being haunted. --<em>Chris Schluep</em></p><h2>The Sacred Remains: American Attitudes Toward Death, 1799-1883</h2><p>When George Washington died in 1799, towns throughout the country commemorated the event with solemn processions featuring empty coffins. In contrast, after Abraham Lincoln's death in 1865, his body was transported around the North and displayed for more than two weeks, for by then corpses could be autopsied, drained of their blood, and beautified for the benefit of mourners. This absorbing book explores the changing attitudes toward death and the dead in northern Protestant communities during the nineteenth century. Gary Laderman offers insights into the construction of an "American way of death," illuminating the central role of the Civil War and tracing the birth of the funeral industry in the decades following the war.<br><br>Drawing on medical histories, religious documents, personal diaries and letters, literature, painting, and photography, Laderman examines the cultural transformations that led to nationally organized death specialists, the practice of embalming, and the commodification of the corpse. These cultural changes included the development of liberal theology, which provided more spiritual views of heaven and the afterlife; the concern for health, which turned those who managed death toward more scientific treatment of bodies; and growing sentimentalism, which produced an increased desire to gaze upon the corpse or to take and keep death photographs. In particular Laderman focuses on the transforming effect of the Civil War, which presented so many Americans with dead relatives who needed to be recovered, viewed, and given a "proper burial." <br></p><p>Gary Laderman is an assistant professor in the Department of Religion at Emory University.</p><h2>Gardening Complete: How to Best Grow Vegetables, Flowers, and Other Outdoor Plants</h2><p><i>Gardening Complete</i> is the most up-to-date and complete guide to gardening for homeowners.

From plain bed coverings of fabric scraps to exquisitely wrought pieces made for the "best bed," each of the 120 examples featured in the book tells its own story of abundance or want, peace or war, tradition or novelty.</p><p>Instead of the usual chronological approach taken by many quilt histories, <i>Georgia Quilts</i> looks at a number of themes through which the common story of the state, its people, and its quilting legacy can be told. Chapters follow various threads of the craft, including Civil War-era quilts, the cotton economy, quilting groups, feed sack quilts, everyday and fine-craft quilts, and special-occasion quilts, including those made as gifts to honor athletes at the 1996 Olympic games. The volume's contributors have a deep knowledge of, and strong personal ties to, quilt history and quiltmaking in Georgia.</p><p>The Georgia Quilt Project, beginning in 1990, has documented more than 9,000 quilts. Volunteers conducted dozens of Quilt History Days around the state, interviewing quilt owners and examining and photographing their quilts. The 120 quilts included in this book have been chosen from the thousands seen by the Project. Some are notable for their beauty, rarity, or workmanship; others are simple, functional objects that have been cherished for their ties to family history. All have their own stories to tell about family, community, and the desire to leave something tangible behind.</p></p><p>ANITA ZALESKI WEINRAUB is the chairwoman of the Georgia Quilt Project and a contributor to <i>The Olympic Games Quilts</i> volume. She has curated four quilt exhibitions at the Atlanta History Center.<p>Better than fiction and more compelling than any history book, <i>Georgia Quilts</i> is a unique account of this state&#x2019;s rich heritage. Culling through more than 9,000 quilts brought to the Georgia Quilt Project survey, the authors formed a book that is part history and part quilt education. <i>Georgia Quilts</i> is spectacular, with revealing stories and fine research.</p> (Merikay Waldvogel <i>author of <i>Southern Quilts: Surviving Relics of the Civil War</i></i>)<br><br><p>Quilts are one of America&#x2019;s favorite, and most vital, grassroots art forms. In the 1990s, The Georgia Quilt Project documented more than 9,000 historic and contemporary quilts residing in Georgia, the majority made in this state. Following a series of excellent exhibits, this long-awaited book provides a summary of the research findings that should prove invaluable in comparing our state&#x2019;s quilting heritage with that of other states already surveyed or awaiting similar projects. Beyond the data on the quilts themselves, the multifaceted essays offer perspectives that place the quilts within their proper historical, social, and human settings and create, like a pieced quilt itself, as close to a complete picture of Georgia&#x2019;s quilting story as we are likely to see.</p> (John A.

The once-humble quilt, now widely hailed as an art form, takes center stage in <i>Georgia Quilts</i>. With this lush 304-page tome, Georgia becomes the latest U.S. state to proudly claim a scholarly study of its quilts . . . <i>Georgia Quilts</i> offers more than quilts. It gives us the women who made them and 200 years of the Georgia in which they lived.

Over nearly two centuries, the Mexican victory over an outnumbered band of Alamo defenders has been transformed into an American victory for the love of liberty. Why did the historical battle of 1836 undergo this metamorphosis in memory and mythology to become such a potent master symbol in Texan and American culture?</p><p>In this probing book, Richard Flores seeks to answer that question by examining how the Alamo's transformation into an American cultural icon helped to shape social, economic, and political relations between Anglo and Mexican Texans from the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries. In the first part of the book, he looks at how the attempts of heritage society members and political leaders to define the Alamo as a place have reflected struggles within Texas society over the place and status of Anglos and Mexicans. In the second part, he explores how Alamo movies and the transformation of Davy Crockett into an Alamo hero/martyr have advanced deeply racialized, ambiguous, and even invented understandings of the past.</p></p><p>Richard R.

This intense allegiance continued almost until the moment of independence, an event defined by an emotional break with the king. By reading American history forward from the seventeenth century rather than backward from the Revolution, McConville shows that political conflicts long assumed to foreshadow the events of 1776 were in fact fought out by factions who invoked competing visions of the king and appropriated royal rites rather than used abstract republican rights or pro-democratic proclamations. The American Revolution, McConville contends, emerged out of the fissure caused by the unstable mix of affective attachments to the king and a weak imperial government. Sure to provoke debate, <i>The King's Three Faces</i> offers a powerful counterthesis to dominant American historiography.<br><br></p><p>"Expands commonplace observations about the political tactics of resistance and revolution into a revisionist view of eighteenth-century American development. . . .

Yet, there are myriad ways to exercise effective political leadership--as well as different ways to fail. We blame our leaders for economic downfalls and praise them for vital social reforms, but rarely do we question what makes some leaders successful while others falter. In this magisterial and wide-ranging survey of political leadership over the past hundred years, renowned Oxford politics professor Archie Brown challenges the widespread belief that strong leaders--meaning those who dominate their colleagues and the policy-making process--are the most successful and admirable.<br><br>In reality, only a minority of political leaders will truly make a lasting difference. Though we tend to dismiss more collegial styles of leadership as weak, it is often the most cooperative leaders who have the greatest impact. Drawing on extensive research and decades of political analysis and experience, Brown illuminates the achievements, failures and foibles of a broad array of twentieth century politicians. Whether speaking of <i>redefining</i> leaders like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, and Margaret Thatcher, who expanded the limits of what was politically possible during their time in power, or the even rarer <i>transformational</i> leaders who played a decisive role in bringing about systemic change--Charles de Gaulle, Mikhail Gorbachev and Nelson Mandela, among them--Brown challenges our commonly held beliefs about political efficacy and strength.<br><br>Overturning many of our assumptions about the twentieth century's most important figures, Brown's conclusions are both original and enlightening. <i>The Myth of the Strong Leader</i> compels us to reassess the leaders who have shaped our world - and to reconsider how we should choose and evaluate those who will lead us into the future.<br></p><p><b>Archie Brown</b> is Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University and an Emeritus Fellow of St. Antony's College, Oxford, where he was a Professor of Politics and Director of St. Antony's Russian and East European Centre. In 2010 he received one of the three Diamond Jubilee Lifetime Achievement in Political Studies Awards. Brown is considered one of the foremost experts in Soviet and Communist politics, the Cold War, and political leadership, and has advised several political leaders, including Margaret Thatcher on the eve of Gorbachev's first visit to Britain. The author or editor of over eighteen books, including <i>The Gorbachev Factor</i> and <i>The Rise and Fall of Communism--</i>both winners of the W.J.M. Mackenzie Prize for best political science book of the year--Brown lives in Oxford."...an important and unusual read ... Brown does a wonderful job of showing how the same qualities that can seem so appealing in strong leaders can lead, in the mildest cases, to bad decision-- and, in the most extreme cases, to death and suffering on a massive scale ... Though <i>The Myth of the Strong Leader</i> is about political leadership, you come away from Brown's book with a deeper understanding of leadership in general."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Bill Gates' Favorite Books of 2016</b></i></b><br><br>"Counter-intuitive but splendidly argued ...

Bruen and Starr's third tag-team free-for-all seems engineered to be a pleasure of the guiltiest kind, like No Country for Old Men as directed by Mel Brooks. Max Fisher, legend in his own mind, is finally where he truly belongs: prison. Will his backside withstand the unwelcome attention of the Crips, the Aryan Brotherhood, and his hulking cell mate Rufus? Does bullshit float? For a time, yes, and Max swaggers like Don Rickles cast as Travis Bickle. Far away, Max's ex, Angela Petrakos, is engaged in bloody deeds with the slimy rou� Sebastian (a dead ringer for Lee Child), which will land her in the caged heat of a lesbian prison; well, it is prison on the Isle of Lesbos. Meanwhile, aspiring true-crime writer Paula Segal agonizes over her lust for Laura Lippman, but would go to the altar--and even the conjugal trailer--with the repulsive Max in her ruthless hunt for fame.

It permits a person to fantasize and to experiment with new identities. It flaunts glamour and success. Appearance becomes something to be perfected and admired.<p>These dreams and freedoms, Rebecca Arnold proposes, are contradictory. Fashion and its surrounding imagery elicit fear and anxiety in their consumers as well as pleasure. Fashion has come to incorporate the underside of modern life, with violence and decay becoming a dominant theme in clothing design and photography.</p><p>Arnold draws on diverse written sources to explore the complex nature of modern fashion. She discusses a range of key themes: how fashion uses and abuses the power of wealth; the alienating promotion of "good" taste; the power plays of sex and display; and how identities can be blurred to disguise and confuse. In order to unravel the contradictory emotions of desire and anxiety they provoke, she never loses sight of the historical and cultural contexts in which fashion designers and photographers perform.</p><p>Generously illustrated, Fashion, Desire and Anxiety focuses on the last thirty years, from photographic works of the 1970s to the beginning of the twenty-first century.</p></p><p>Rebecca Arnold is a senior lecturer in cultural studies, fashion history and theory at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London.&#34;The contradictory nature of fashion relates to our unease about the body and its representation, we are fascinated by and yet uncertain of the responses dress provokes; its juxtapositions can be protective, shielding the wearer from those outside their group, who are unable to read the complex signifiers that are pulled around the body.&#34;</p><h2>Black Power in the Belly of the Beast</h2><p><p></p><p></p>Despite the growing scholarly interest in the Civil Rights movement, to date there has been no comprehensive examination of the Black Power movement.

Mauriac paints an unforgettable portrait of spiritual isolation and despair, but he also dramatizes the complex realities of forgiveness, grace, and redemption. Set in the countryside outside Bordeaux, in a region of overwhelming heat and sudden storms, the novel's landscape reflects the inner world of Th�r�se, a figure who has captured the imaginations of readers for generations.<br><br>Raymond N. MacKenzie's translation of Th�r�se Desqueyroux, the first since 1947, captures the poetic lyricism of Mauriac's prose as well as the intensity of his stream-of-consciousness narrative. MacKenzie also provides notes and a biographical and interpretive introduction to help readers better appreciate the mastery of Fran�ois Mauriac, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1952. This volume also includes a translation of "Conscience, The Divine Instinct," Mauriac's first draft of the story, never before available in English.</p><p><b>Raymond N. MacKenzie</b> is professor of English at the University of St. Thomas, St. Paul, MN.Aimed at the American English ear, MacKenzie's syntax restores the Jazz Age punch of Mauriac's original. Thanks to MacKenzie's introduction, notes, and translated first draft of Mauriac's text ('Conscience'), Therese's sexuality is also restored, making her once again an ambivalent 'new woman' [la gar�onne] of the 1920s and a scandalous protagonist for a 'Catholic novel.' As a result, the interwar 'Catholic revival' [renouveau catholique] also recovers its punch with Mauriac's challenge to bourgeois Catholicism. With new eyes and ears, another generation of readers can now wade with Therese Desqueyroux into 'the human river.' (Stephen Schloesser, author of Jazz Age Catholicism: Mystic Modernism in Postwar Paris, 1919-1933)<br><br>An invaluable volume for those exploring Mauriac or his place in the French Catholic renaissance. MacKenzie's fresh, highly readable translation of Mauraic's disturbing masterpiece includes translator's notes and an excellent introduction. His inclusion of Mauriac's first draft permits rare insights into the startling evolution of the eponymous heroine. (William Bush, Professor Emeritus of French Literature at the University of Western Ontario, Canada)<br><br>It is safe to say that Francois Mauriac's Th�r�se Desqueyroux has achieved the most coveted form of 'immortality' that any writer could hope for: inclusion on countless university and secondary school reading lists for both courses and exams. Only a few French novels share this distinction. Thus, Professor MacKenzie's excellent translation is well timed, for Th�r�se, a great novel by any criterion, will be read by many throughout the rest of the new century. The Gerard Hopkins translation, competent and reliable in its day, nonetheless shows signs of wear. The English language, particularly in North America, has evolved considerably in the intervening three quarters of a century since its publication, and a fresh new translation in today's idiom is most welcome. This bright new translation is a valuable addition to Mauriac studies, and will add to the luster of Mauriac's reputation in the English-speaking world. Thanks to Professor MacKenzie, a new generation of readers in the English-speaking world will be able to have a direct, lively and utterly reliable interaction with Mauriac 's great novel.

When the opposite occurs and love causes fracturing, disenchantment, and existential turmoil, we suffer deeply, especially if we feel that love has failed us or that we have failed to experience what others seem so effortlessly to enjoy. <br><br>In this eloquently argued, psychologically informed book, Mari Ruti portrays love as a much more complex, multifaceted phenomenon than we tend to appreciate&#x2015;an experience that helps us encounter the depths of human existence. Love's ruptures are as important as its triumphs, and sometimes love succeeds because it fails. At the heart of Ruti's argument is a meditation on interpersonal ethics that acknowledges the inherent opacity of human interiority and the difficulty of taking responsibility for what we cannot fully understand. <br><br>Yet the fact that humans are often irrational in love does not absolve us of ethical accountability. In Ruti's view, we must work harder to map the unconscious patterns motivating our romantic behavior. As opposed to popular spiritual approaches urging us to live fully in the now, Ruti treats the past as a living component of the present. Only when we catch ourselves at those moments when the past speaks in the present can we keep ourselves from hurting the ones we love. Equally important, Ruti emphasizes transcending our individual histories of pain, an act that allows us to face the unconscious demons that dictate our relational choices. Written with substance and compassion, <i>The Summons of Love</i> restores the enlivening and transformative possibilities of romance.</p><p><p>An inspiring and consoling meditation on the complexities of romantic love.</p>Mari Ruti was educated at Brown University and Harvard University.

Seduction is a game as easily played as subterfuge, but when Jamie poses a as suitor to a rival clan&#x2019;s daughter in order to expose treason, the line between duty and pleasure is suddenly blurred.

The delicate points, embellished with tiny jewels, framed her face like a sparkling halo. She bit back a mischievous smile, having no illusions in that regard. As her brothers so often delighted in pointing out, she was far too bold and opinionated to ever be confused with an angel. &#x201c;A man wants a biddable, demure lass for a wife,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d tease, knowing full well they were only encouraging her to do the opposite.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finished at last, she stepped back to get a better view of her new gown in the small mirror. Excitement sparkled in her eyes. The dress was truly magnificent. She met the reflected gaze of her beloved nursemaid in the looking glass. &#x201c;Oh, Mor, isn&#x2019;t it the most gorgeous gown you&#x2019;ve ever seen?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mor had been watching the proceedings with the brooding consternation of a mother sending her son into battle for the first time. The analogy wasn&#x2019;t too far off. Tonight, there would be a great feast to celebrate the opening of the Highland gathering being held this year at Ascog. But Caitrina was well aware that her father had every hope of securing her betrothal to one of the many Highlanders who would be descending on their keep to test their strength and skill. Quickly, before it could spoil the excitement of her gift, she pushed away the disagreeable thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gorgeous?&#x201d; The older woman snorted her disapproval, staring meaningfully at the low-cut square bodice where Caitrina&#x2019;s bosom strained to near bursting against the tight confines of stays and satin. Mor shuffled the young maidservant out of the room and then resumed her diatribe. &#x201c;Immodest is more like it. And I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s wrong with the twenty other &#x2018;gorgeous&#x2019; gowns you have hanging in the ambry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Caitrina scrunched her nose. &#x201c;Oh, Mor, you know I have nothing like this.&#x201d; She glanced down at the swell of flesh rising high over the edge of her gown. The neckline was rather low. She could practically see the pink edge of her&nbsp;...&nbsp;She fought the blush, knowing that it would only give Mor further cause for argument. &#x201c;This gown is quite proper,&#x201d; she said firmly. &#x201c;All the fashionable courtiers are wearing dresses just like this at Whitehall.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mor muttered something that sounded suspiciously like &#x201c;damn fool English,&#x201d; which Caitrina chose to ignore. Centuries of enmity would not be forgotten simply because Scotland&#x2019;s king had also become England&#x2019;s. She lifted the pale gold silk in her hand, allowing the light from the window to catch in iridescent waves, and sighed dreamily. &#x201c;I feel like a princess in this dress.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The old woman snorted. &#x201c;Well, it certainly cost a king&#x2019;s ransom to have such a gown sent all the way from London to the Isle of Bute.&#x201d; Mor paused and shook her head. &#x201c; &#x2019;Tis sheer foolishness when there are perfectly capable dressmakers in Edinburgh.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But they are woefully out-of-date with the most recent styles,&#x201d; Caitrina protested. Still, something Mor said bothered her. She bit her lip, not having considered the cost of her father&#x2019;s largesse. &#x201c;Do you really think it was too costly?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mor lifted a sardonic brow, unable to hide her amusement. &#x201c;Blackmail doesn&#x2019;t usually come cheap.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Caitrina&#x2019;s mouth twitched, fighting another smile. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t blackmail. The gown was Father&#x2019;s idea. No doubt he was feeling guilty for forcing me to endure the attentions of the endless parade of peacocks he struts across our hall. I think he agreed to have the gathering at Ascog with the hope that with so many &#x2018;braw lads&#x2019; to choose from, I would find one to my liking&#x2014;as if I were picking a bull at market.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In truth, her father&#x2019;s insistence that Caitrina begin a search for a husband worried her more than she wanted to let on. It wasn&#x2019;t like him to be so stubborn. That was Mor&#x2019;s domain.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mor assiduously avoided the subject of marriage and returned to the gown. &#x201c;That man would have offered you the moon to see your tears dried. I suppose it could have been worse than one dress.&#x201d; She shook her finger at Caitrina. &#x201c;But one of these days someone is going to come around who you can&#x2019;t twist around that pretty little finger of yours.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Caitrina grinned. &#x201c;They already have.&#x201d; She leaned over and pressed a kiss on the wizened cheek. &#x201c;You.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ha.&#x201d; Mor chortled. &#x201c;Incorrigible scamp.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Caitrina wrapped her arms around the old woman, resting her cheek against the scratchy wool of her arisaidh, savoring the warm, familiar scent of peat and heather&#x2014;of hearth and home. &#x201c;Do you really not like the gown, Mor? I won&#x2019;t wear it if you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mor held her back by the shoulders and looked into her eyes. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t listen to me, lass. I&#x2019;m just a silly old woman who&#x2019;s worried about what the wolves may do to my wee lamb.&#x201d; Her gaze softened. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been so sheltered, with no inkling of the wickedness of men.&#x201d; The back of her finger smoothed Caitrina&#x2019;s cheek. &#x201c;That gown simply reminds me that you are a woman full grown.&#x201d; Caitrina was surprised to see tears misting in Mor&#x2019;s troubled eyes. &#x201c;You look so much like your mother. She was the most beautiful lass in the Highlands when she ran off with your father.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Caitrina&#x2019;s chest squeezed; though her mother had been gone for over ten years now, the pull of emotion was still strong. She&#x2019;d been eleven when her mother succumbed to the wasting ailment, and the memories of the laughing, beautiful woman who&#x2019;d held her in her arms grew fuzzier with each year that passed. But there would always be an empty place in her heart and the knowledge that a vital piece of her was missing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tell me again, Mor.&#x201d; She never tired of hearing the story of how her father had caught one glimpse of his enemy&#x2019;s daughter and fallen in love. Of how her parents had met secretly for months, until her father finally convinced her mother to run away with him.<br> &nbsp;<br> But before Mor could respond, Caitrina&#x2019;s younger brother came bursting into her room. &#x201c;Caiti! Caiti Rose, come quick!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her heart plummeted, thinking the worst. Who was hurt, and how badly? She grabbed Brian by the shoulders and with a calmness she didn&#x2019;t feel&#x2014;but with three brothers to take care of, she&#x2019;d unfortunately become used to&#x2014;said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He eyed her warily. &#x201c;Promise you won&#x2019;t be angry?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How can I promise when I don&#x2019;t know what it is?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At only two and ten, Brian had yet to develop firm negotiating skills. He gave up bargaining and started with excuses. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t my fault,&#x201d; he hedged. &#x201c;I told Una&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At the mention of the little girl&#x2019;s name, Caitrina guessed what was wrong. &#x201c;Oh, Brian! How many times have I told you to keep those beastly dogs away from the kittens?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked down at his feet, shamefaced. &#x201c;I told Una that I was taking the lads out, but she forgot to close the door to the stables, and then, well, it happened so fast. Boru was just playing, but the silly cat ran up the tree.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Caitrina groaned. &#x201c;What tree?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Brian grimaced. &#x201c;The old oak. Caiti, please, you have to help me get the kitten down before Una finds out. She&#x2019;ll cry.&#x201d; He kicked at the wooden floor uncomfortably. &#x201c;I hate it when she cries.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Caitrina met Mor&#x2019;s gaze. Una was her granddaughter, and Mor had a soft spot for the little girl.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see if I can keep her occupied while you,&#x201d; Mor said, stabbing her finger at Brian&#x2019;s lanky chest, &#x201c;get that kitten out of the tree.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come, Caiti, hurry,&#x201d; he said, dragging her by the hand from her solar.<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t until they&#x2019;d stepped outside the keep and started toward the gate in the barmkin wall that the curious stares of her clansmen reminded her that she was still wearing her new gown&#x2014;and no shoes. <br> &nbsp;<br> Though the skies were blue, the ground was damp from this morning&#x2019;s rain, and mud squished between her toes. Knowing there was nothing she could do about it now, she lifted her skirts as best she could to keep from soiling the hem.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You might have given me a moment to change my gown,&#x201d; she grumbled.<br> &nbsp;<br> Brian spared her a hurried glance. &#x201c;Why? You look fine.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She rolled her eyes. Brothers. She could be wearing a sackcloth and they wouldn&#x2019;t notice.<br> &nbsp;<br> After passing through the gate, they headed down the path, taking the right fork that led toward the woodlands&#x2014;the left led down to Loch Ascog. On the eve of the games, the outbuildings along the banks of the loch were bustling with activity, but as she and Brian hurried toward the trees it was surprisingly quiet, except for Boru&#x2019;s barking, which grew louder as they neared the great old oak. The Lamonts descended from the great kings of �ire, and Brian had named the dog after his namesake&#x2014;Brian Boru, the famed high king of centuries past.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You left the dog here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her brother reddened. &#x201c;I told him to go home, but he wouldn&#x2019;t listen. Since the silly cat was already stuck in the tree, I figured it wouldn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s probably scared the poor thing half to death.&#x201d; She turned to the dog and said sharply, &#x201c;Boru!&#x201d; He stopped barking and looked at her, head cocked at an inquisitive angle. She pointed in the direction of the castle, no longer visible through the trees. &#x201c;Home.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> With a soft whimper, Boru nuzzled her skirts and gave her an apologetic look with his soulful brown eyes. She shook her head, refusing to be moved. The dog certainly had a gift for the dramatics. &#x201c;Home, Boru.&#x201d; Whimpering again, this one even more pathetic, the great deerhound hung his head low and trotted back toward the castle.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Gnostic 3: Featuring Jung and the Red Book</h2><p>The third issue of The Gnostic: A Journal of Gnosticism, Western Esotericism and Spirituality.

Acting on the advice of another angler, Zane Grey, who said "Some dreams, even those of a fisherman, come true," the author took a month off from harried city life and flyfished every day in the midst of the world's greatest wildlife migration: the parade of fish and whales, butterflies and birds past Montauk Point.<br><br> This is the story of a man's love affair with Montauk in the fall, after the crowds and celebrities have left eastern Long Island. It is the story of an ocean teeming with life, and the people drawn to it: obsessed anglers, jealous guides, dedicated scientists, and the local people who have lived off the bounty of these waters for generations. But above all it is a story of a man's basic love of people and nature, one that will appeal to the many fans of Kaminsky's "Outdoors" column in the <em>New York Times</em>, and his frequent work in <em>Food &amp; Wine</em>, as well as anyone hungering for fine writing.</p><p><strong>Peter Kaminsky</strong> is the author of numerous books, including <em>The Moon Pulled Up an Acre of Bass</em>, <em>Pig Perfect</em>, and <em>The Elements of Taste</em>. He was formerly <em>New York</em> magazine's "Underground Gourmet," and his Outdoors column runs regularly in the <em>New York Times</em>. His work has appeared frequently in <em>Food &amp; Wine</em> and <em>Field &amp; Stream</em>, and he was managing editor of <em>National Lampoon</em>. He lives in Brooklyn.The East Coast migratory striped bass has the same trans-species attachment with Long Islanders as the blue crab does with the Chesapeake region, and the cod with New Englanders; striper fishing is nowhere more exciting, or more socially complicated, than in early fall off Montauk, New York. After the summer tide of celebrities and vacationers leaves the beaches, local sportfishers form their own society around the parade of southbound migrations. Not the average "hook and bullet" reporter, Kaminsky took a sabbatical from his New York Times column to fly-fish Montauk Point through the October peak, lured by the life fantasy of one dream fly-fishing season, an angling "walkabout into something perfect and outside of time." The tides of his obsession with the fish in this place occasionally carry him way offshore into social history, local color and ecology of the bass. The real prose action is on the shallow flats of Great Peconic Bay and in the jockeying among guide boats and surf casters for prime casting positions for "blitzes" of feeding 40-inch bass. Kaminsky (whose cookbook, Elements of Taste, is due out from Little, Brown in October) is neither the first nor the most stylish voice for this fish and this place (the Montauk bass fishery has its own shelf in angling literature, which includes John Cole's Striper and Peter Matthiessen's Men's Lives). Nonetheless, most Eastern fly rodders will revel in Kaminsky's walkabout and feel as wistful as he does when the cold northeast winds finally put down the fish in November. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Zwingli and Bullinger (Library of Christian Classics)</h2><p><p>Selections from the writings of Ulrich Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger, two lesser-known church reformers, are contained in this volume.

When the British abandoned Philadelphia to return to New York City, American troops harassed their retreat. On the morning of 28 June 1778, General Lee, George Washington&#39;s lieutenant, attacked the British rearguard but his attack went badly wrong. The British rearguard, now reinforced, threw Lee&#39;s troops into a headlong retreat. Lee was relieved of his command and Washington&#39;s Continentals then stood toe-to-toe with the British, bloodily repulsing a series of powerful attacks by crack troops.</p><p>Highly visual guides to history&#39;s greatest conflicts, detailing the command strategies, tactics, and experiences of the opposing forces throughout each campaign, and concluding with a guide to the battlefields today.Brendan Morrissey trained as a lawyer before working as a PR consultant and writer in the defence industry, principally with British Aerospace.

The one is that which the ancient sages termed the Clavicle, the other that which people on the country-side still call the Grimoire. The numbers and subjects of the chapters which correspond in both parts, are in no sense arbitrary, and are all indicated in the great universal key, of which we give for the first time a complete and adequate explanation.

This fully illustrated book examines Imperial Japan's last throw of the dice.</b></p><p>Fully illustrated throughout, <i>Desperate Sunset </i>examines the development and evolution of the kamikaze using first-hand accounts, combat reports, and archived histories.</p><p>By the middle of 1944, Imperial Japan's armed forces were in an increasingly desperate situation. Its elite air corps had been wiped out over the Solomons in 1942-43, and its navy was a shadow of the force that had attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. But the Japanese had one last, desperate, card to play. </p><p>The Japanese High Command decided that the way to inflict maximum damage on the superior enemy forces was to get the poorly trained Japanese pilots to crash their explosive-laden aircraft onto their target, essentially turning themselves into a guided missile. The kamikazes announced themselves in the immediate aftermath of the Leyte Gulf naval battles, sinking the USS <i>St. Lo</i> and damaging several other ships. The zenith of the kamikaze came in the battle of Okinawa, which included ten <i>kikusui</i> (Floating Chrysanthemum) operations that involved up to several hundred aircraft attacking the US fleet.</p></p><p><b>Mike Yeo</b> is a Singaporean aviation enthusiast and a keen student of aviation history and the Pacific War who is currently based in Melbourne, Australia.

The storytelling perspective varies: sometimes from the martyr&#x2019;s point of view or that of a friend or relative, sometimes that of a child or bystander&#x2014;or even the executioner or betrayer. The martyrs come alive through these stories and their witness for Christ inspires us.

But she fears this stranger who burns to avenge the wrongs of treacherous men. For Caleb is as wild and unpredictable as the uncivilized land he loves. Yet, though she challenges him at every turn, the spirited southern lady knows this proud, enigmatic loner is her destiny.

She lives in the Sierra Nevada Mountains with her husband, with whom she writes novels under a pseudonym. Her favorite activity is exploring the Western United States to find the landscapes that speak to her soul and inspire her writing.</p>In this tedious historical romance, Lowell ( Tell Me No Lies ) gives barely enough plot to keep a short story moving. Willow Moran, a West Virginian who lost her parents and most of her possessions during the Civil War, is traveling west with her remaining valuables--five Arabian horses--to find her brother Matt, who is prospecting for gold. Her guide from Denver to the San Juan mountains is former Army scout Caleb Black who, unbeknownst to Willow, also is hunting Matt; on her deathbed, after bearing an illegitimate baby, Caleb's sister named Matt as her seducer. The largely uneventful journey, complicated only by ruffians who are pursuing them (to steal Willow's horses and finish a fight begun in Denver with Caleb), occupies a substantial portion of the book: Willow and Caleb spend much of their time riding, eating and lusting after each other. By the time the hero, ``with a silent curse at his unruly desires,'' indulges in yet another assessment of the heroine, wondering ``how her hair would feel spilling over his naked skin,'' the reader is likely to be silently cursing right along with him--and brother Matt isn't even close to being on the horizon. <p></p><p>Copyright 1991 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Anti-Gravity and the Unified Field (Lost Science Series)</h2><p>Explored here is how gravity, electricity, and magnetism manifest from a unified field around us; why artificial gravity is possible; secrets of UFO propulsion; free energy; Nikola Tesla and anti gravity airships of the 20s and 30s; flying saucers as superconducting whirls of plasma; anti-mass generators; vortex propulsion; government cover-ups; gravitational pulse drive; spacecraft; and more.</p><p>David Hatcher Childress, known as the real-life Indiana Jones to the many fans of his books, is a captivating speaker and the author or coauthor of over 25 books. He has traveled the world several times over, seeking adventure and the answers to the mysteries of mankind's past. Born in France in 1957 and raised in the mountains of Colorado and Montana, David's curiosity about the world was piqued at a young age. He attended the University of Montana where his studies in oriental culture and philosophy led him to a job teaching English in Taiwan. In 1976, David left the United States on what would become a six-year research and adventure odyssey. During this time, he studied first-hand the ancient civilizations of Africa, the Middle East and China, sometimes journeying into dangerous territory along the way (like Uganda during the overthrow of Idi Amin). After more than 40 years of investigating these arcane subjects, David finds his unique views and ideas gaining popularity. He is currently a co-star on the History Channel show Ancient Aliens.

The heat coincided with a pitched presidential contest between William McKinley and the upstart Democrat William Jennings Bryan, who arrived in New York City at the height of the catastrophe. As historian Edward P. Kohn shows, Bryan's hopes for the presidency began to flag amidst the abhorrent heat just as a bright young police commissioner named Theodore Roosevelt was scrambling to mitigate the dangerously high temperatures by hosing down streets and handing out ice to the poor.<p> A vivid narrative that captures the birth of the progressive era, <i>Hot Time in the Old Town</i> revives the forgotten disaster that almost destroyed a great American city.</p></p><p><b>Edward P.

Donald, author of <i>Lion in the White House: A Life of Theodore Roosevelt</i></b><br> &#x201c;Of the writing of books about Theodore Roosevelt there seems to be no end. But Edward P. Kohn's book is one that does not recycle old facts in new form. Here is a window on the world of Roosevelt that is entirely new. His activities during a fierce heat wave in New York City in 1896 that killed hundreds of people and horses is depicted in chilling episodes. City government was slow to act, but department heads like Roosevelt, who was police commissioner, took initiatives and showed the kind of leadership that led to future fame. With a wide lens Kohn scans this horrific happening during a critical campaign for president. His portraits of Roosevelt and his contemporaries are skillful and memorable.&#x201d;<br><br><br><br>&#x201c;Kohn raises two novel arguments: that the heat wave was responsible for destroying William Jennings Bryan&#x2019;s political career, and that it was responsible for bolstering that of Theodore Roosevelt&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</i><b><i>Florida</i><i>&nbsp;Weekly</i></b>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t easy to blow the dust off of more than a century of history and make it relevant but historian Edward P.

Along the way, Kohn makes a strong case that the most prominent casualty may well have been the presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, whose disastrous visit to the city during the height of the crisis helped win the White House for William McKinley. That same heat wave, Kohn reveals, also did wonders for the political career of the city&#x2019;s dynamic young police commissioner, Teddy Roosevelt.

But his fatal leap coincides with the arrival of Dr. Goldsworthy&#x2014;a student of the famous Dr. Anton Mesmer and his research into animal magnetism. Sir John&#x2019;s suspicions grow when he learns that Goldsworthy&#x2019;s patron in London is none other than the beautiful Lady Lammermoor. And the deeper Jeremy investigates the Lammermoor family, the more suspects he discovers who stand to gain from Lord Lammermoor&#x2019;s death. <br> &nbsp;<br> "A wonderful series."&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p><p><b>Bruce Alexander</b> is the pseudonym for a well-known author of fiction and nonfiction.

Alexander's many fans will find the final, posthumous Sir John Fielding mystery (after 2003's <i>The Price of Murder</i>) a bittersweet experience. It marks a triumphant return to the series' strengths, with the blind magistrate Fielding, the real-life founder of London's fledgling police force, the Bow Street Runners, once again playing a prominent role in unraveling a baffling crime. When Lord Lammermoor, who's involved in drafting emergency legislation to combat the American rebels on the eve of the Revolutionary War, falls to his death from Westminster Bridge, the insightful sleuth and his loyal legman, Jeremy Proctor, uncover clues suggesting that the lord was murdered, possibly through a form of hypnotism. While the guilty party's identity is obvious fairly early on, the author's gifts for vivid characterizations, colorful period details and fast pacing are very much in evidence. His two collaborators deserve acclaim for making it impossible to tell where Alexander's words end and theirs begin, and for enabling one of the worthier recent historical series to go out on a well-deserved high note. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Smith, music critic for the Baltimore Sun, and Schoenberg, a tenor saxophonist and jazz educator, provide basic introductions geared to lay readers, focusing on the essentials of their respective musical genres, including a history of the form, a description of genres, brief biographies of featured composers and performers, glossaries, and recommended pieces and recordings (50 CDs for each). The charm of this series is the manner in which the authors cover the important points in their own casual yet expert tone, pointing up details along the way with intriguing sidebars (concert etiquette for classical and various historical figures for jazz) or turns of phrase while presenting thought-provoking artist or repertoire selections that will encourage spirited debate. The jazz volume suffers from a few minor editorial glitches (e.g., incorrect alphabetizing and typos), but both books are well crafted and logically organized. Smith's book is reminiscent of Michael Walsh's Who's Afraid of Classical Music? with updated scholarship and some different perspectives, while Schoenberg's complements Gene Seymour's Jazz: The Great American Art. Highly recommended for their combination of reliable information and accessible style, these are real bargains for public libraries. (Indexes not seen.) Barry Zaslow, Miami Univ.

When Bolsheviks bomb her family&#x2019;s country estate in 1910, crippling her younger sister, Katya, 17-year-old title character Valentina is left with guilt and resolve. With a slim frame but steely character, she defies both convention and her father, who is the czar&#x2019;s minister of finance, first by training and working as a nurse and then by refusing to marry for money (in order to solve the family&#x2019;s financial problems).

When he was ten, Bowen&#x2019;s family moved to Bozeman, Montana, where a paper route introduced him to the grizzled old cowboys who frequented a bar called The Oaks. Listening to their stories, some of which stretched back to the 1870s, Bowen found inspiration for his later fiction.<br> &nbsp;<br> Following time at the University of Michigan and the University of Montana, he published his first novel, <i>Yellowstone Kelly</i>, in 1987. After two more novels featuring the real-life western hero, Bowen published <i>Coyote Wind</i> (1994), which introduced Gabriel Du Pr�, a mixed-race lawman living in fictional Toussaint, Montana. He has written fifteen novels in the series, in which Du Pr� gets tangled up in everything from cold-blooded murder to the hunt for rare fossils.

A former lawyer and an amateur historian,&nbsp;he lives with his wife, Jan.Prologue<p>Oakland, CaliforniaApril 17, 1946</p><p>FirstSide/New Virginia</p><p></p><p>John Rolfe had rented the house for seventy-five a month, which sounded extortionate but was something close to reasonable, given the way costs had gone crazy in the Bay Area since Pearl Harbor. The landlord was willing because Rolfe promised to do the badly needed repairs himself, and because he had a soft spot for soldiers his son had died on Okinawa, where Rolfe had taken three rounds from a Nambu machine gun and gotten a Silver Star, a medical discharge and months on his back in a military hospital. The house was a solid three-bedroom piece of Victoriana, a little shabby and run-down like the area, shingle and dormers; what they called Carpenter Gothic hereabouts, but at least it had a basement. The previous owners had been Japanese-American, sent off to the relocation camps in 1942; then it had been rented out to workers in the shipyards to the north, part of the great wartime inrush, and they&#x2019;d made a mess of it.</p><p>A whole house to himself was an indulgence anyway, since he was unmarried, but he&#x2019;d spent too much of the last four years on troopships and in crowded bases and bivouacs, plus painful months in the crowded misery of a hospital. Solitude was restful.</p><p>He rubbed his thigh as he limped out to the porch, scooping up a bottle of milk, the mail and the newspaper. The mail included his monthly check from Uncle Sam, which was welcome; every little bit helped to stretch the modest legacy from his father, even though the house and land back in Virginia had gone for a surprising sum. There were also a few more no-thank-yous from prospective employers. The market for ex-captains wasn&#x2019;t all that brisk, not when their only other qualification was Virginia Military Institute. Being able to endure Beast Barracks, run an infantry company, and take out a Nip bunker complex...well, none of them were really salable skills in peacetime, particularly when they went with a slowly healing gimp leg. War heroes were a dime a dozen in the United States these days. He&#x2019;d get something eventually....</p><p>I&#x2019;m still having better luck than my grandfather, he thought.</p><p>John Rolfe III had lost a leg at Second Manassas, leading a regiment of the Stonewall Brigade against the United States, under Jackson. That had turned out to be a bad decision, at least from the viewpoint of the family fortunes; though not as bad as Gramps&#x2019; subsequent one to put everything he had into Confederate bonds as a patriotic gesture.</p><p>Of course, I&#x2019;d have done exactly the same thing, but there&#x2019;s no denying it never pays to lose, he thought with a chuckle.</p><p>There was also a letter from Andy O&#x2019;Brien, who&#x2019;d been his top sergeant in Baker Company until he and Rolfe were invalided out on the same day. Enemy holdouts had infiltrated in the dark just before dawn and nearly overrun them; it had come down to bayonets and clubbed rifles, boots and fists and teeth, with only the muzzle flashes to light chaos and terror and the stink of death.</p><p>For a moment his face froze under a film of cold sweat and the paper crumpled in his fist as a year vanished in an instant he remembered the ugly crunching feel that shivered up the ruined weapon as the butt of his Garand splintered on a Nip&#x2019;s face, with a splash of blood that blinded him and ran salt and hot into his own open screaming mouth. He remembered the bayonet poised to kill him until O&#x2019;Brien smashed it down and hacked the wielder&#x2019;s head half off with an entrenching tool, roaring in a berserker fury. That cut off suddenly as the bullets struck him like fists pounding on a block of beef and he toppled into the officer, pawing with arms gone flaccid.</p><p>He&#x2019;d carried the big Irishman out on his back until that slant-eyed bastard with the Nambu cut his left leg out from under him and broke the bone in three places; then he&#x2019;d had to crawl....</p><p>He gave a shuddering exhalation and wiped a hand over his face. It was very bad when the memories came like that, taking you back so you could feel and taste and touch, so you were there again.</p><p>Got to stop doing that. It&#x2019;s over, goddamn it, and you&#x2019;re alive.</p><p>The daytime memories weren&#x2019;t as bad as the dreams, but they were a lot more embarrassing; nobody was around at midnight to hear him screaming.</p><p>He opened the screen door with two fingers, kept it open with his elbow as he got his foot up on the doorsill, and let it bang behind him as he went into the kitchen, tossed the mail on the table and put the milk in the Frigidaire, taking out some cold fried chicken left over from last night and a couple of big juicy tomatoes. One of the advantages of living in California was that you could get fresh vegetables earlier than most places. Rolfe&#x2019;s housekeeping was painstakingly neat, a legacy of VMI and an inborn fastidiousness, but he didn&#x2019;t pretend to be able to cook beyond the can-opener-and-campfire level.</p><p>You&#x2019;re only twenty-four, he thought, eating and reading the paper. Your life isn&#x2019;t over; it just feels that way sometimes.</p><p>The postwar world was going to hell in a handbasket, according to the Chronicle. The Russians were cutting up ugly in Eastern Europe; half the people between England and the Ukraine were starving or dying of typhus or both; the Reds were making gains in China; the French were trying to get Indochina back, and not having much luck; ditto the Dutch in Java; the Brits were having problems with the Jews in Palestine.</p><p>And MacArthur was lording it over the Nips, who were evidently worshiping him like a god or their own emperor. Which meant that Dugout Doug was finally getting what he thought he deserved.</p><p>He&#x2019;s almost as good a general as he thinks he is, Rolfe thought with a smile. Which means he&#x2019;s pretty damned good. We may need him again, someday. Vanity&#x2019;s a small price to pay, and I don&#x2019;t believe in an end to wars.</p><p>And closer to home, John Lewis was talking about taking the coal miners out on strike again. Rolfe ground his teeth slightly in fury. He was a Democrat, of course it was virtually hereditary; where he was born they hadn&#x2019;t forgotten whose idea Reconstruction was or who went around waving the Bloody Shirt afterward, but...</p><p>But I&#x2019;d have had Lewis taken out and shot for striking during the war, he thought, and tossed the folded newspaper aside, standing and stretching cautiously.</p><p>The leg made it difficult to sit comfortably when it stiffened up, and it reminded him each time that he was less than he&#x2019;d been before the wound. He was naturally an active man, a little above average height and built like a greyhound, slim but deep-chested and lithe, with short-cropped hair the color of new bronze and leaf-green eyes in a narrow, straight-nosed face.</p><p>It was a fine April day, Bay Area style; that meant a bit chilly, with a cool ocean breeze out of the northwest coming in through the kitchen windows. The noontime haze over the bay was gone, and there were probably whitecaps out there on it no ocean view here, of course, or the place would have been too expensive for him. A few planes were overhead from the naval air station farther north, adding the drone of their engines to a subdued hum of traffic, a ship&#x2019;s horn, the distant clang of electric trolley cars. Rolfe finished his sparse meal, washed the dishes and doggedly went through another of the exquisitely painful series of exercises the doctors said would help the damaged muscles and tendons heal. That done, he felt he deserved some fun.</p><p>The basement was clean and tidy now, big and dim, smelling of the cement mortar he&#x2019;d used to patch cracks, and mostly empty except for tubs, scrub board and mangle. Or it had been until the shortwave set arrived; it was war surplus, of course, and he&#x2019;d gotten it cheap through friends. He&#x2019;d also fiddled with the insides a good deal, and he flattered himself he&#x2019;d made some improvements certainly he&#x2019;d improved the reception, even if he&#x2019;d nearly killed himself rigging the antenna on the roof. Engineering and math had been his best subjects at VMI, and he&#x2019;d been thinking about using this G.I. Bill to get into one of the California universities you could do that and convalesce at the same time. A field officer had to be able to sprint, but there were types of civilian engineer who didn&#x2019;t, and with luck he could still avoid being stuck behind a desk all the time.</p><p>One thing engineers didn&#x2019;t have to be either was poor. Genteel rural poverty was something he knew far too well from his Tidewater childhood to court willingly.</p><p>His fingers moved confidently over the exposed tubes and circuits as he thought. With a grunt of satisfaction he made the final connection, flipped the power switch and sat back to let the tubes warm up </p><p>CRACK!</p><p>The sound was earsplitting, louder than thunder, accompanied by a dazzling flash. John Rolfe threw himself out of the chair with long-conditioned reflex, hitting the dirt and blinking the dazzle out of his eyes desperately, because if you couldn&#x2019;t see then you didn&#x2019;t get to go on breathing....</p><p>It took a couple of extra blinks before he realized that he was really seeing what his eyes were showing him. The far wall of the basement the long side to the right of his shortwave set was...gone. Instead of a mortared fieldstone wall half-covered in rawly new pine-plank shelving, there was a sheet of something silvery, something that rippled very slightly, like the surface of a body of water set on its side, staying there in defiance of gravity.</p><p>No, not like water, he thought. It was too shiny; the overhead lights he&#x2019;d put in above the workbench had turned pale, as if there were some diffuse internal glow from the surface of the whatever-it-was. It&#x2019;s not like water. It&#x2019;s like a sheet of mercury standing on its side.</p><p>He could smell his own sweat, and it felt cold and clammy down his flanks, and there was a liquid feeling south of his belly button, and his testicles were trying to crawl up to meet it, but he was used to functioning well while he ignored the physical sensations of fear. Once you got going, you were too busy to notice it. His eyes flickered back and forth, trying to catch details in something so strange that it slid away from the surface of his mind. Then he noticed the shelves he&#x2019;d put up for tools, and storage for miscellaneous junk that his aunt Antonia had shipped out when he got out of the hospital; stuff that had been around since his father died in &#x2019;41, and his mother moved in with her.</p><p>Now all he could see was the base; the upper nine-tenths of the shelving had toppled out into the whatever-it-was. He took a stiff step forward, then crouched and touched the rough wood; it felt completely normal, no hotter or colder than it should be, texture the same. Carefully bracing his foot against the flagstones of the cellar floor, he pulled on one section. It stuck for a moment, then slid back into the room with him, leaving the silvery nothingness undisturbed.</p><p>It was if he had pulled the shelf out of a mercury pond that neither wet it nor rippled as the wood went through its surface. His fingers found no damage, except where the backs of the shelves had splintered in a few places as if they&#x2019;d fallen against rocks. And there was dirt, a little, and bits of grass and leaf caught in irregularities, and his hand darted out and closed on an insect. A perfectly ordinary insect, a beetle of some sort. He flicked it away, and it vanished through the silvery barrier.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be damned,&#x201d; he whispered in the soft purring drawl of eastern Virginia. &#x201c;Ah will be eternally damned.&#x201d;</p><p>Swallowing, he extended his hand. There was a momentary coolness as it slid through the surface, faint and fleeting, perhaps only his mind expecting the shock of water. Then nothing except wind on his fingers, which felt completely normal when he wiggled them, despite the arm looking as if it ended where the silvery surface began. There was no unusual sensation at all as he withdrew it, and wiggled the fingers again in front of his face.</p><p>Decision hardened. John Rolfe took a deep breath and leaned forward. For a moment he was dazzled, but that was only because the setting sun shone into his eyes. He gasped at that, and then again as he looked down, seeing his own head and shoulders emerging from a flat expanse of ever-so-slightly rippling silver. Because what he saw was certainly not his basement or anything in Oakland, California; and that meant the front half of him was a long way from the rear, joined only by the odd material of this gate to wherever. His swift-hammering heart must be pumping blood across some unimaginable gap.</p><p>The stones of his cellar wall were scattered before him down a low grassy slope, with the shelving and tools and boxes lying on top of them and above that a clear blue sky streaked with high cloud. Just beyond, perhaps twenty yards away, was a tree a huge, gnarled, wide-spreading coast live oak, unmistakable to anyone who&#x2019;d spent any time in California, blocking most of whatever lay beyond as the sun glistened on its new springtime leaves. He could see glimpses of vivid green salt marsh, and beyond it the blue glint of open water. Right where San Francisco Bay ought to be if the city of Oakland weren&#x2019;t in the way. And between him and the live oak, a bear.</p><p>A grizzly. Old Eph himself, a big silvertip male, standing erect for a better view and weaving its long massive head in curiosity as it stared at him.</p><p>John Rolfe tumbled backward with a yell, landing on his backside on the unyielding stone of the basement&#x2019;s floor. For perhaps three minutes he lay there, the hard gritty surface cold under his palms, and then a long slow grin lit his face.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s happening, he thought. But whatever it is, I suspect my days of being bored are over.</p><p>It took only a moment to go upstairs, change into jeans and flannel shirt and boots, and add a brown jacket and billed cap; they were his hunting clothes, bought for when he&#x2019;d recovered enough to take up the sport again. He loved stalking deer, and an African safari had been his when-I-strike-it-rich daydream for years. He took down a rucksack and dumped in a few things from the kitchen, matches and canned beans, enough for an overnight camp if he wasn&#x2019;t picky and the weather wasn&#x2019;t too cold. The pain in his leg was distant, unimportant, as he clattered down into the basement and over to a tall steel footlocker he&#x2019;d installed underneath the stairs that led up to the pantry. The lock was a combination model. He twisted the dial and then opened the door, hesitating for a second as he reached in.</p><p>His old webbing belt was folded on a top shelf; he swung it around his Levi-clad hips and buckled it with a sudden decisive movement. Checking the .45 was automatic; slide out the magazine, thumb the top round, slide it in with a snap and pull the action back. He buckled the holster flap down over the pistol and took the Garand rifle out of its rack, pushing in an eight-round clip and letting the bolt snick home.</p><p>He still had a deep affectionate respect for the Garand design, and had bought one from an accommodating supply sergeant as soon as he got out of the hospital; it hadn&#x2019;t been difficult in the freewheeling chaos that accompanied demobilization after V-J day. The .30-06 rounds ought to make even a grizzly sit up and take notice; he tos...</p></p><h2>The Paul Quest: The Renewed Search for the Jew of Tarsus</h2><p>A <em>Christianity Today</em> 1999 Book of the Year! Who was the real Paul? Some of Paul's contemporaries seem to have asked the same question. For some he was Paul the tentmaker. For others he was Paul the heretic, Paul the peripatetic philosopher, Paul the would-be apostle, Paul the prophet, or Paul the founder of Christian communities and missionary hero. For more than a decade there has been a renewed quest for the real Paul behind the Acts of the Apostles and the collection of Pauline letters. Although this quest has not gained the visibility of the renewed quest of the historical Jesus, it is a thriving enterprise joined by Protestant, Catholic and Jewish scholars as well as those interested in Paul as a figure of the first-century Greco-Roman world. One of the great gains of this quest for the historical Paul has been a fresh encounter with Paul the Jew. The flood of new insight into Judaism of the first century has illuminated features of Paul that were previously obscured. A scholarly reacquaintance with the classical Roman world has filled in even more details. In this book, Ben Witherington III examines and evaluates the various profiles of Paul that have been newly discovered or recently refurbished. We encounter Paul as an ancient Mediterranean personality and watch him operate in a social environment where honor, shame, patronage and corporate identity are daily considerations. We discover new dimensions of Paul's epistles as we observe him dictating letters and gauging his rhetoric. We enter into the field of controversy where Paul the apostle and prophet meets his opponents. We reconsider the nature of the human body and Christian community as we meet Paul the anthropologist and champion of woman and slave. Paul, the man of the big idea, shows himself to be in truth a storyteller and interpreter of Israel's holy history. In and through all of these complexities, we discover Paul to be a consistent and coherent theologian and ethicist whose thinking reaches out across nearly two thousand years to engage men and women today. With <em>The Paul Quest</em> Witherington leads an exploratory tour and reappraisal of the historical Paul, a sweeping survey of the contemporary rediscovery of the Jew from Tarsus.</p><p>Ben Witherington III (PhD, University of Durham) is Jean R. Amos Professor of New Testament for Doctoral Studies at Asbury Theological Seminary. A prominent evangelical scholar, he is also on the doctoral faculty at St. Andrews University in Scotland. Witherington has written over forty books, including <em>The Jesus Quest</em> and <em>The Paul Quest,</em> both of which were selected as top biblical studies works by <em>Christianity Today.</em> His other works include <em>The Indelible Image</em>, <em>Women and the Genesis of Christianity</em>, <em>The Gospel Code</em>, <em>A Week in the Life of Corinth</em> and commentaries on the entire New Testament. He also writes for many church and scholarly publications and is a frequent contributor to <em>Patheos</em> and <em>Beliefnet</em>. Witherington is an elected member of the prestigious Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas, a society dedicated to New Testament studies. He is a John Wesley Fellow for Life, a research fellow at Cambridge University and a member of numerous professional organizations, including the Society of Biblical Literature, Society for the Study of the New Testament and the Institute for Biblical Research. He previously taught at institutions like Ashland Theological Seminary, Vanderbilt University, Duke Divinity School and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. An ordained pastor in the United Methodist Church and a popular lecturer, Witherington has presented seminars for churches, colleges and biblical meetings around the world. He has led numerous study tours through the lands of the Bible and is known for bringing the text to life through incisive historical and cultural analysis. Along with many interviews on radio and television networks across the country, Witherington has been seen in programs such as <em>60 Minutes</em>, <em>20/20</em>, <em>Dateline</em> and the Peter Jennings ABC special <em>Jesus and Paul&#x2015;The Word and the Witness</em>."Ben Witherington offers us an academically robust, illuminating, comprehensive yet admirably lucid portrait of Paul in the social, cultural and religious setting(s) of the eastern Mediterranean. A 'must' for all students of Paul." (Max Turner, London Bible College)<br><br>"This book is a welcome addition to Pauline literature that attempts to accurately discover the apostle's identity, and contributes to the scholarly understanding Paul's world. Ben Witherington convincingly presented the apostle Paul as an ancient Mediterranean person whose identiy needs to be reconstructed very differently from ours. The different aspects of Paul's identity were carefully argues and help modern readers get a sense of what type of person Paul was." (The Mourning Dove Caws (themourningdovecaws.wordpress.com), July 21, 2009)<br><br>"This discussion of Paul, his environment and Pauline scholarship bears the hallmarks of a flourishing textbook for undergraduate teaching in the years to come. It is comprehensive in scope, readable, full of historical insights and fair in its treatment of differing views." (Dr Thorsten Moritz, Cheltenham University College)<br><br>"The past three decades witnessed a major series of incisive developments in Pauline studies&#x2015;the man, his mission, his motivation and his message. Students and scholars alike can easily get lost in the plethora of contributions to this field: commentaries, monographs, essays and other studies. With remarkable breadth of learning and a vigorously lucid style, Ben Witherington III explores this complex terrain, maps out the landscape of an enormous field, and provides insight and direction to anyone interested in coming to a better understanding of Paul and the topography of his world and letters. Witherington deserves both congratulations and thanks for this fresh survey and fascinating guidebook." (Marion L.

His picture book <i>The Paperboy </i>received a Caldecott Honor. He lives in the Pacific Northwest. www.pilkey.comIn a bold departure for Pilkey ( When Cats Dream ), these two brazenly funny picture books spoof Godzilla and King Kong as they launch the mice inhabitants of Mousopolis against, respectively, a killer cat and dog. Touched-up photographs of the author's pets are set against fluorescent cityscapes and luminous skylines. The texts ripple with corny but kid-pleasing puns ("The Big Cheese tried to catch up to the hot dog with all the relish he could muster") and shameless gags (" 'What are you, men or mice?' 'Mice,' they squeaked"), while the pictures are packed with sly allusions (the mice give Kat Kong passage on the U.S.S. Ignatz ). Dogzilla is the more successful volume, for it works within its own simple framework--giant dog steals cookout food, mice win a playful revenge--and even delivers a surprise ending. The more hard-hearted Kat Kong jestingly raises serious issues (Does morality have a position in science?) without acknowledging their validity. Pilkey's irreverent exuberance is irresistible nonetheless. These inventive books may lack the elegance and soul of William Wegman's work, but they are infinitely more fun.

Oligarchs and oil barons may still dominate international news coverage, but their prosperity masks a deep-rooted demographic tragedy. Faced with staggering population declineand near-certain economic collapsedriven by toxic levels of alcohol abuse, Russia is also battling a deeper sickness: a spiritual one, born out of the country&#x2019;s long totalitarian experiment.<br><br>In <i>The Last Man in Russia</i>, award-winning journalist Oliver Bullough uses the tale of a lone priest to give life to this national crisis. Father Dmitry Dudko, a dissident Orthodox Christian, was thrown into a Stalinist labor camp for writing poetry. Undaunted, on his release in the mid-1950s he began to preach to congregations across Russia with little concern for his own safety. At a time when the Soviet government denied its subjects the prospect of advancement, and turned friend against friend and brother against brother, Dudko urged his followers to cling to hope. He maintained a circle of sacred trust at the heart of one of history&#x2019;s most deceitful systems. But as Bullough reveals, this courageous group of believers was eventually shattered by a terrible act of betrayalone that exposes the full extent of the Communist tragedy. Still, Dudko&#x2019;s dream endures. Although most Russians have forgotten the man himself, the embers of hope that survived the darkness are once more beginning to burn.<br><br>Leading readers from a churchyard in Moscow to the snow-blanketed ghost towns of rural Russia, and from the forgotten graves of Stalin&#x2019;s victims to a rock festival in an old gulag camp,<i>The Last Man in Russia</i> is at once a travelogue, a sociological study, a biography, and a<i>cri de coeur</i> for a dying nationone that, Bullough shows, might yet be saved.<br></p><p><b>Oliver Bullough</b> is Caucasus editor for the Institute for War and Peace Reporting and author of<i>Let Our Fame Be Great</i>, which won the Overseas Press Club Cornelius Ryan Award. He lives in London.<br>"PRI's" "The World" Best Books of 2014<br> Bullough is a great writer, and anyone who's traveled in Russia will appreciate his deft handling of the surreal scenes one sometimes encounters in the world's largest country. <br>"New York Times Book Review"<br> Bullough is a wonderful companion as he traces the course of Father Dudko s life, visiting the miserable settlements and prisons he left behind.... By the end of the book, you, too, will want to drink shots of vodka with him. These are the chronicles of a writer who truly knows Russia, and who is not beyond having his heart broken. Amid the reams of writing coming from experts in the offices of distant research organizations, there are too few accounts like Bullough s, which convey the deep stories in the lives of Russians. He has unearthed a story of remarkable relevance for today: about the man who walked out of Lefortovo Prison with his hatred of a disintegrating system transformed into a hatred of us. <br>"The Economist"<br> Bullough has a good sense of how the traumas of Russia s past affect its present. His new book is a mixture of travelogue and biography, as he traces the life of Father Dmitry Dudko, an Orthodox priest who exemplified both resistance to Soviet rule and defeat at its hands.... He weaves the woes of past decades into his journeys to wretched villages, along with the lies and greed in the metropolis. Father Dmitry may be all but forgotten in modern Russia, but his old self would have plenty to say about it. <br>"Financial Times"<br> "The Last Man in Russia" is a complex interweaving of two stories: alcoholism in Russia, and the destruction of a moral crusader and opposition figure at the hands of a brutal regime.... Bullough has quite a gift for presenting his material in simple and readable prose.... While "The Last Man in Russia" is more complex than Bullough s previous work, it is also a broader and more fulfilling read. <br>"Newsweek"<br> In Oliver Bullough s bleak, beautiful "The Last Man in Russia," a mix of biography and reportage, Dudko s journey from defiance to submission to self-destruction becomes the archetypal Russian story: a broken man representing a broken nation. <br>"Telegraph," UK<br> A gritty, deeply embedded travelogue that investigates the culture of drinking, the decline of the Russian family and the experience of trying to remain a man in the Soviet system through a sleuth-like hunt for the real story behind Father Dmitry Dudko. <br>"Sunday Times" (London)<br>"As he follows the locations of the priest's life, Bullough mixes his own research into Russia's modern history with stories of encounters on the road, a combination as potent as the vodka that is bringing down the nation.... Out of the story of Father Dmitry's life and the reality of a nation drowning in drink, Bullough draws an extraordinary portrait of a nation struggling to shed its past and find peace with itself. <br>"Sunday Telegraph" (London)<br>"Part biography, part history, Oliver Bullough's book is also an attempt to demarcate the front lines of the battle for the Russian soul.... The subject matter is rendered palatable by Bullough's brisk, lucid style and his skilful interweaving of historical context with his own rich experience of Russia. He has a talent for sketching the people he meets, often administering a welcome dose of humour, and he appreciates the absurd, in the best Russian tradition.<br>Bullough's questing, roving spirit is admirable....

Weaving together the narrative strands...and bolstering them with solid research, [Bullough] charts the decline of the Russian nation. He is particularly good at conjuring key moments, vivid characters and credible dialogue, and at flipping between the small incident and the big picture.... Imagining is a whole lot easier with such a lively, well-written and commanding narrative to guide us." <br>"The Christian Science Monitor"<br> Bullough has tracked down some of those past and present brave souls who have stood up to the monstrous pressures and violence; doing so, Bullough has renewed his own and our faith in the tradition of Russian dissidents remarkable integrity. The writing is sparkling and his appreciation for the real heroism of so many Russians is enough to give us hope against hope that the people will free themselves from their increasingly corrupt and incompetent government. The unreasonable and wonderful faith that Bullough, Navalny, and the persecuted rock band Pussy Riot seem to share is that as bad as Russia is now, as locked down as it is now, it can t stay locked. There are too many keys in circulation that will open the door to Mother Russia s revival. <br>"Daily Telegraph" (London)<br>"In this superb hybrid of travel and social analysis, "The Last Man in Russia," Bullough casts a despairing eye on a nation's death through alcohol.... In pages of raw, poetic prose, Bullough travels to Father Dmitry's birthplace in western Russia and on to his prison-Gulag, 1,250 miles from Moscow. Throughout, he dilates sorrowfully on the self-denial of vodka drinkers....

While most of what Bullough finds in the past and the present shows why one Russian priest told him, I look at the future with pessimism, the book does end with a glimmer of hope, which is a fitting tribute to Father Dmitry and to Bullough s ability to find and illuminate a story worth telling." <br>"Library Journal"<br> A compelling read, Bullough s book is a must for anyone interested in the sociological, psychological, or personal effects of faith and political change on a nation struggling to find its identity and sustain hope. <br>"Russian Life Magazine"<br> Dudko's story is indeed a fascinating one and worthy of the space and time that Bullough gives it. And the manner of his telling - as much a modern travelogue far off beaten Russian paths as a biography - is both unusual and engaging. For in understanding Dudko, we better understand all that Russians have been throughthe book ends on a high note, with the nascent hope that filled 2011's winter demonstrations. <br>"Booklist"<br>"An inquisitive traveler, Bullough conveys a vividly descriptive impression of contemporary Russia." <br>Andrew Meier, author of "The Lost Spy: An American in Stalin s Secret Service"<br> Few in the West dare take note of the Russian cross: the birth and death rates that head in opposite directions and forecast a grim future for the world s largest country. But Oliver Bullough travels Russia with eyes wide open. "The Last Man in Russia" is an archeological dig in search of a moral compass. Tracing the life of a single priestfrom believer to dissident to apologist for the state and even Stalinhe lays bare the troubles haunting the new Russia. <br>"</p><h2>Sewing Dolls</h2><p><p>Adults and children alike will love making and playing with these dolls, which are all made from natural materials.

Hiring a native boy, Coco, to assist him in his travels, Tintin rescues Snowy from a crocodile. He recognised a stowaway from the ship that had brought them to the continent who attempts to kill Tintin. Tintin is saved by monkeys who throw coconuts down from a tree, knocking the stowaway unconscious. Snowy is kidnapped by a monkey, and Tintin rescues him.<br>The next morning, Tintin, Snowy, and Coco crash their car into a train, which the reporter fixes and tows to the Babaorum's village. He is greeted there by the king, and accompanies the king on a hunt the next day, where Tintin is knocked unconscious by a lion. Snowy rescues him by biting the lion's tail off. Tintin gains the admiration of the natives, which makes the Babaorum witch-doctor Muganga jealous; with the help of the stowaway, he plots to accuse Tintin of destroying the tribe's sacred idol. Imprisoned by the villagers, Tintin is rescued by Coco and shows the villagers footage of Muganga conspiring with the stowaway to destroy the idol, which enrages the villagers. Tintin becomes a hero in the village, and a local woman bows down to him, saying, White man very great! Has good spirits ... White mister is big juju man!<br>Angered, Muganga starts a war between the Babaorum and their neighbours, the M'Hatuvu, whose king leads an attack on the Babaorum village. Tintin outwits them, and the M'Hatuvu people cease hostilities and also come to idolise Tintin. Muganga and the stowaway plot to kill Tintin while framing it on a leopard, but Tintin survives, while saving Muganga from a boa constrictor; Muganga pleads mercy and ends his hostilities. The stowaway attempts to capture Tintin again, and eventually succeeds disguised as a Catholic missionary. They fight across a waterfall, and the stowaway is eaten by crocodiles.[ After reading a letter from the stowaway's pocket, Tintin finds that someone called A.C has ordered that he be killed. Tintin captures a criminal who tried to rendezvous with the stowaway, and learns that A.C. is American gangster Al Capone, who was trying to gain control of African diamond production. Tintin and the colonial police arrest the rest of the diamond smuggling gang.</p><p>In <i>Tintin in the Congo</i>, one of his earliest adventures, our intrepid reporter hunts down both criminals and wild game. The story was written in 1930 and first appeared in book form in 1931, and some of the parts are so dated that for years the book was unavailable in English. This edition reprints on black-and-white newsprint the original 1931 version. In one scene, Tintin tells a group of African children "Today, I'm going to talk to you about your country: Belgium!" When the story was updated and colorized (but not translated into English) in 1946, this became a simple lesson in addition. In addition to the colonial attitude, the Africans are portrayed as primitive, simple-minded folk ("He doesn't look very bright," Snowy opines about their guide), and Tintin reveals a brutal side by slaughtering half the wildlife on the continent (including blowing up a rhinoceros with dynamite!) and declaring while pursuing an enemy, "Sure as my name's Tintin, I'll get rid of him once and for all." Herge himself was embarrassed by much of <i>Tintin in the Congo</i>, and it's not a part of the regular canon, but fans who can accept it as a product of its time will enjoy seeing their hero in one more adventure, one that provides a jumping-off point for the much-better-known <i>Tintin in America</i>. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907. His pseudonym comes from his initials backwards (R.G., as pronounced in French). Over the course of 54 years he completed 23 albums of The Adventures of Tintin series, which is now considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics series of all time. With translations published in over 80 languages, more than 230 million copies sold worldwide and a Hollywood movie to its name, Tintin dominates the Comics and Graphic Novels chart even today. Sadly, Herge died in 1983, leaving his 24th album, Tintin and Alph-Art, unfinished, but his hero continues to be one of the most iconic characters in both adult and children&#39;s fiction.</p><h2>Into the Dark: An Anthology (Lords of the Underworld)</h2><p><br><br><strong>Three otherworldly tales from the master of paranormal romance...and a brand-new Lords of the Underworld bonus guide!</strong><br><br><em>The Darkest Fire</em>&#x2014;a Lords of the Underworld prequel<br>Geryon is the guardian of hell, more monster than man.

He should not have studied her that first time and should have kept his gaze downcast all the times since. He was a slave to the prince of darkness, spawned by evil; she was a goddess, created in light.<br><br>He could not have her, he thought, hands fisting. No matter how much he might wish otherwise. She would not want him anyway. This...obsession was pointless and brought him nothing but despair. He did not need more despair.<br><br>And yet, still he watched her this day as she floated through the barren cavern, coral-tipped fingers tracing the jagged stones that separated underground from underworld. Golden ringlets flowed down her elegant back and framed a face so perfect, so lovely, Aphrodite herself could not compare. Eyes of starlight narrowed, a rosy color blooming in those cheeks of smooth alabaster.<br><br>"The wall is cracked," she said, her voice like a song amid the hiss of nearby flames&#x2014;and the unnatural screams that always accompanied them.<br><br>He shook his head, positive he had merely imagined the words. In all their centuries together, they had never spoken, never deviated from their routine. As the Guardian of Hell, he ensured the gate remained closed until a spirit needed to be cast inside. That way, no one and nothing escaped&#x2014;and if they tried, he rendered punishment. As the goddess of Oppression, she fortified the physical barrier with only a touch. Silence was never breeched.<br><br>Uncertainty darkened her features. "Have you nothing to say?"<br><br>She stood in front of him a moment later, though he never saw her move. The scent of honeysuckle suddenly overshadowed the stink of sulfur and melting flesh, and he inhaled deeply, closing his eyes in ecstasy. Oh, that she would remain just as she was....<br><br>"Guardian," she prompted.<br><br>"Goddess." He forced his lids to open gradually, slowly revealing the glow of her beauty. Up close, she was not as perfect as he had thought. She was better. A smattering of freckles dotted her sweetly sloped nose, and dimples appeared with the curve of her half-smile. Exquisite.<br><br>What did she think of <em>him? </em>he wondered.<br><br>She probably thought him a monster, hideous and misshapen. Which he was. But if she thought so, she did not show it. Only curiosity rested in those starlight eyes. For the wall, he suspected, not for him. Even when he'd been human, women had wanted nothing to do with him. They'd run from him the moment he'd turned his attention to them. He'd been too tall, too brawny, too bumbling. And that was <em>before </em>he'd resembled an ogre.<br><br>Sometimes he wondered if he'd been tainted at birth.<br><br>"Those cracks were not there yesterday," she said. "What has caused such damage? And so swiftly?"<br><br>"A horde of Demon Lords rise from the pit daily and fight to break out. They have grown tired of their confinement here and seek living humans to torment."<br><br>She accepted the news without reaction. "Have you their names?"<br><br>He nodded. He did not need to see beyond the gate to know who visited on the other side; he sensed it. Always. "Violence, Death, Lies, Doubt, Misery. Shall I go on?"<br><br>"No," she said softly. "I understand. The worst of the worst."<br><br>"Yes. They bang and they claw from the other side, desperate to reach the mortal realm."<br><br>"Well, stop them." A command, laced with husky entreaty.<br><br>If only. He would have given up the last vestiges of his humanity to do as she wished. Anything to repay the daily gift of her presence. Anything to keep her just where she was, prolonging the sweetness of her scent. "I am forbidden to leave my post, just as I am forbidden to open the gates for any reason but allowing one of the damned inside. I'm afraid I cannot grant your request."<br><br>Besides, the only way to stop a determined demon was to kill it, and killing a High Lord was another forbidden act.<br><br>A sigh slipped from her. "Do you always do as you're told?"<br><br>"Always." Once he had fought the invisible ties that bound him. Once, but no longer. To fight was to invite pain and suffering&#x2014;not for him, but for others. Innocent humans who resembled his mother, his father and his brothers&#x2014; because his true mother, father and brothers had already been slain&#x2014;were brought here and tortured in front of him. The screams... oh, the screams. Far worse than the ones that seeped from Hell. And the sights... He shuddered.<br><br>Had the pain and suffering been heaped upon <em>him, </em>he would not have cared. Would have laughed and fought all the harder. What was a little more pain? But Lucifer, brother to Hades and prince of the demons, needed him healthy, whole, so had found other ways to gain his cooperation.<br><br>The memories would forever haunt him, but might have faded during the night, if he'd required sleep. He remained awake, however, every hour of every day, never able to forget.<br><br>"Obedience. I expected differently from you," she said. "You are a warrior, so strong and assured."<br><br>Yes, he was a warrior. But he was also a slave. One did not cancel out the other. "I am sorry, goddess. My strength and assurance change nothing."<br><br>"I will pay you to help me," she insisted. "Name your price. Whatever you desire shall be yours."<br><br>If only, Geryon thought again. He would ask for a single taste of her lips.<br><br>Why limit himself, though? he wondered next. <em>Whatever he desired. </em>He could ask for a night in her arms. Naked. Touching. Tasting. Yes. <em>Yes. </em>Every muscle in his body clenched. In arousal. In desperation.<br><br>In despair.<br><br>No. He could not risk the suffering of the innocent&#x2014;<em>why do you bother with them?</em>&#x2014;simply to sate his craving for the lovely goddess. So have a kiss? A night with her? No again.<br><br><em>Finally I know true torture. </em>He ground his teeth. Why did he bother? Because without good, there would be only evil. And he had seen too much evil over the centuries. He would not be responsible for more.<br><br>"Guardian?" the goddess prompted. <em>"Anything."</em><br><br>Do not speak. Do not do this. Geryon gulped. "I am sorry, goddess." <em>No. Say no more. Ask for that kiss, at the very least. </em>"As I told you, I cannot help you." <em>No, no, no.</em><br><br>How he hated himself just then.<br><br>Her delicate shoulders sagged in disappointment, and his self-hatred grew. "But... why? You want to keep the demons in Hell just as much as I do. Right?"<br><br>"Right." Geryon didn't want to tell her his reasons for refusing her, was still ashamed after all this time. Tell her, however, he would. Perhaps then she would return to the old ways and pretend he did not exist. As it was, his craving for her was deepening, intensifying, his body hardening. Readying.<br><br><em>She's not for you.</em><br><br>How many times would he need the reminder before this conversation ended?<br><br>"I sold my soul," he admitted. He had been one of the first humans to walk the earth. Despite his massive build and bumbling ways, he'd been content with his lot and enraptured by his mate, even though she'd been chosen by his family and, like all the other females of his acquaintance, had not desired him in return.<br><br>A year into their marriage, she had grown sick, and he had despaired. Though she had found no joy with him, she had belonged to him, and ensuring her safety and well-being had been his duty. So he had cried out to the gods for assistance.<br><br>They had ignored him, and his despair became unbearable.<br><br>That was when Lucifer appeared before him. So cunning, that one was.<br><br>To save his mate&#x2014;and perhaps finally win her heart&#x2014; Geryon had willingly given himself to the dark prince. And found himself transformed from man to beast. Horns had sprouted atop his head, and his hands had become clubs, his nails claws. Dark, carmine fur had covered the skin on his legs, while hooves replaced his feet.<br><br>In seconds, he'd been more animal than human.<br><br>His wife had healed, as his contract with Lucifer stated, but she had not softened toward Geryon. No, his selfless act had meant nothing to her and she had left him for another man. A man she had apparently been seeing all along.<br><br>What a fool he'd been. A cuckold. <em>All for nothing.</em><br><br>"What thoughts fill your head, Guardian? Never have you appeared so...broken."<br><br>The goddess. His hands fisted, claws digging deep into his palms, as he refocused on her. There had been compassion in her tone. Compassion he must ignore. Unemotional, that's how he had to be. Always. Otherwise, he would not survive his time here.<br><br>"My actions are no longer mine to command. No matter how I wish otherwise, I cannot help you. Now please. Don't you have duties to attend to?"<br><br>"I am doing my duty now. Are you?"<br><br>He flushed.<br><br>She sighed. "Forgive my waspishness. I am frazzled." The goddess studied him, her head tilting to the side. He shifted uncomfortably, such scrutiny unnerving given his sickening appearance. To his surprise, revulsion did not darken her lovely gaze as she said, "Your soul belongs to the dark prince?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"And if your soul was returned to you, you would aid me?"<br><br>"Yes," he repeated, the word a croak. Would she still offer him a boon for that aid?<br><br>"Very well. I will see what I can do."<br><br>His eyes widened in horror. Approach Lucifer? "No, you must&#x2014;"<br><br>She disappeared before he could stop her.<br><br><em>Inner Corridors of Hell</em><br><br>"Lucifer, hear me well. I demand to speak with you. You <em>will </em>appear before me. This day, in this room. Alone. I will remain exactly as I am." Kadence, goddess of Oppression, knew to state her wants precisely or the demon prince would "interpret" them however he wished. "And you will be clothed."<br><br>Were she simply to demand an audience, he might whisk her to his bed, her arms and legs tied, her clothing gone, a legion of fiends surrounding her.<br><br>Several minutes ticked by and there was no response to her summons. But then, she'd known there wouldn't be. He enjoyed making her wait. Made him feel powerful. <em>Keep busy. Act as if you do not care.</em><br><br>Kadence eyed her surroundings, as if studying them was exactly what she'd come to do. Rather than stone and mortar, the walls of Lucifer's palace were comprised of flames. Crackling, orange-gold. Deadly.<br><br>His throne was comprised of bone, ash and more of those flames. Off to the side was a bloodstained altar. A lifeless body still lay across it&#x2014;minus a head. The head would<br><br>reattach all too soon, however, so that the torturing could begin anew. That was the way of it here.<br><br>No soul would escape. Even in death.<br><br>She hated everything about this place. Plumes of black smoke wafted from the blazes, curling around her like fingers of the damned. So badly she wanted to wave her hand in front of her nose, but she did not. She wouldn't show weakness&#x2014;even with so small an action.<br><br>Did she dare, she knew she would find herself <em>drowning </em>in the noxious fumes. Lucifer loved nothing more than exploiting vulnerabilities.<br><br>Kadence had learned that lesson well. The first time she had visited, she'd come to inform both Hades and Lucifer that she had been appointed their warden. As one who embodied the essence of subjugation and conquest, there was no one better to ensure that demons and dead alike remained here.<br><br>Or so the gods had thought, which was why they'd chosen her for this task.<br><br>She had not agreed, but refusing them would have invited punishment. Many times since accepting, however, she'd thought perhaps punishment would have been better. Having stones thrown at her, bloody carcasses left on her doorstep in warning...they hardly compared to spending her days sleeping in a nearby cave&#x2014;not a true sleep but a watchful one, her mind's eye drifting over the different demon camps. Could hardly compare to spending her nights surveying a wall of rock.<br><br>As the Guardian watched.<br><br>That, however, was not such a hardship.<br><br>For many years, his attention had unnerved her, for he was unlike anyone she had ever met: half man, half beast, all... edge. But then she'd come to find comfort in his detached gaze. He protected her from demons and souls who slipped through the gate, attacking everyone in their path. No matter the harm to himself.<br><br>She could do no less for him.<br><br><em>I sold my soul, </em>he'd said. For what? she wondered. What had he received in return? Did he consider the trade a good one? She'd wanted to ask him, but had recalled how uncomfortable he had been with her questions about the wall. He would not have welcomed a discussion about something so personal.<br><br>And that was probably for the best. Only her job mattered right now. How could she not have known demon High Lords were determined to escape <em>forever?</em><br><br>Had Lucifer somehow blocked her visions of this realm? He was the only one strong enough to do so. If so, what did he hope to gain? Were she to ask, he would merely lie, that much she knew.<br><br>She'd never felt more helpless.<br><br>No, that wasn't true. During her first visit, Lucifer had sensed her trepidation&#x2014;and he'd since used every opportunity to nurture it. A fire-coated touch here, a wicked taunt there. Every time she had come here to report an infraction, she had wilted under his attentions.<br><br>That had disappointed the gods. They would have called her home, she was sure, had they not already bound her to the wall, an act that had been meant to help with her duties, not hinder them. But not even the gods had known just how deeply the bond would go. Rather than simply sensing when the wall needed fortification, she'd realized it was her reason for living.<br><br>Her blood now sang with its essence.<br><br>The first time one of the demons had scratched it, she'd felt the sting and had gasped, shocked. Now, it no longer shocked her, though she still felt every contact. When a soul brushed it, her skin felt tickled. When the inferno licked at it, she felt burned. So why had she not sensed these latest ministrations?<br><br>Oh, she'd felt her body draining of strength, little by little, pains shooting through her seemingly for no reason, but her visions had been calm. Well, as calm as such visions could be, considering what she was forced to witness on a daily basis.<br><br>Now, at least, she knew why she'd hurt. Bound as she was to this dark underworld, that crack in the outer wall was literally killing her.<br><br><em>You are losing focus. Concentrate! </em>Distraction could cost her. Dearly. And the outcome of this meeting was more important than any that had come before it.<br><br></p><h2>The Gutenberg Revolution: How Printing Changed the Course of History</h2><p>In 1450, all Europe's books were handcopied and amounted to only a few thousand. By 1500, they were printed and numbered in their millions. The invention of Johann Gutenberg had caused a revolution:&nbsp;printing by movable type. Born in 1400 in Mainz, Germany, Gutenberg struggled against a background of plague and religious upheaval to bring his remarkable invention to light. His story is full of paradoxes: his ambition was to reunite all Christendom, but his invention shattered it; he aimed to make a fortune, but was cruelly denied the fruits of his life's work. Yet history remembers him as a visionary; his discovery marks the beginning of the modern world.</p><p>John Man is a historian and travel writer whose other titles include <i>Alpha Beta</i>, <i>Attila</i>,<i> Genghis Khan</i>, and <i>The Great Wall</i>."Vivid . . . engaging, detailed and highly readable . . . a window on an extraordinary display of consummate skill and creative genius."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>New Scientist</i><br><br>"At the heart of Man's enchanting narrative is Gutenberg's place as an early capitalist, an entrepreneur, deprived of patrician status by his mother's modest background, who set out to strike it rich in business."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"A heavily detailed account, but still accessible to a general audience."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>The best book about the origin of books you could read . . . clear, engaging, fast-paced and authoritative."&nbsp; &#x2014;Stephen Fry<br><br>"Extremely erudite and enormously enthusiastic."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Guardian</i></p><h2>Highland Outlaw: A Novel (Campbell Trilogy)</h2><p>Handsome and dangerous, Patrick MacGregor is a wanted man, possessing the tough, tenacious spirit of his outlawed clan.

Her interest in the Scottish clan system began in the most unlikely of places: a comparative legal history course at Stanford Law School.

But little have we of the past, As up the dell we ramble, To figure, floating on the blast, Thy banners, Castle Campbell! &#x201c;Castle Campbell,&#x201d; by William Gibson Near Castle Campbell, Clackmannanshire, June 1608<br><br>Elizabeth Campbell lowered the creased piece of parchment into her lap and looked out the small window, watching the hulking shadow of Castle Campbell fade into the distance with a heavy heart. No matter how many times she read the letter, it did not change the words. Her time, it seemed, was up.<br><br>The carriage bounced along the uneven road, moving at a painstakingly slow pace. Recent rain had made the already rough road to the Highlands treacherous, but if they continued like this, it would take a week to reach Dunoon Castle.<br><br>Lizzie glanced across the carriage and caught the furtive gaze of her maidservant, Alys, but the other woman quickly shifted her eyes back to her embroidery, feigning a concentration belied by the ill-formed stitches.<br><br>Alys was worried about her, though trying not to show it. Hoping to divert her questions, Lizzie said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how you can sew with all this bumping&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>But her words were cut off when, as if to make her point, her bottom rose off the seat for a long beat and then came down with a hard slam that rattled her teeth, as her shoulder careened into the wood-paneled wall of the carriage.<br><br>&#x201c;Ouch,&#x201d; she moaned, rubbing her arm once she was able to right herself. She glanced at Alys, who&#x2019;d suffered a similar fate. &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, my lady,&#x201d; Alys replied, adjusting herself back on the velvet cushion. &#x201c;Well enough. But if the roads do not improve, we&#x2019;ll be a heap of broken bones and bruises before we arrive.&#x201d;<br><br>Lizzie smiled. &#x201c;I suspect it will get much worse. Taking the carriage at all was probably a mistake.&#x201d; They would have to switch to horses when they passed Stirlingshire, crossed into the Highland divide, and the roads narrowed&#x2014;or, she should say, became more narrow, as they were barely wide enough for a carriage even in this part of the Lowlands.<br><br>&#x201c;At least we&#x2019;re dry,&#x201d; Alys pointed out, always one to see the positive side of a situation. Perhaps that was why Lizzie enjoyed her company so much. They were much alike in that regard. Alys reached down and picked up the letter that had fallen to the ground with the tumult. &#x201c;You dropped your missive.&#x201d;<br><br>Resisting the urge to snatch it back, Lizzie took it casually and tucked it safely in her skirts. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; She could sense Alys&#x2019;s curiosity about the earl&#x2019;s letter, about what was taking them to Dunoon Castle so suddenly, but she wasn&#x2019;t ready to alleviate it. Alys, like everyone else, would find out the contents soon enough. It would be no secret that her cousin the Earl of Argyll intended to find Lizzie a husband.<br><br>Again.<br><br>Apparently, three broken engagements weren&#x2019;t enough. It was her duty to marry, and marry she must.<br><br>Her chest squeezed as the humiliating memory of her most recent broken betrothal returned to her in an unwelcome flash. The pain, even with the passage of two years, was still acute. &#x201c;Elizabeth Monntach,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d called her. And she so eager for compliments that she&#x2019;d &#x201c;lapped them right up like a grateful pup.&#x201d;<br><br>The humiliation still burned. Worse, John was right. She&#x2019;d been far too eager, far too ready to believe that a handsome man like him could care for her for reasons beyond clan alliances and wealth. Her best friend had found happiness; she&#x2019;d desperately wanted it, too. Enough to ignore what her gut was telling her&#x2014;that beneath the handsome exterior was a man of weak character and strong ambition.<br><br>Hearing the man she&#x2019;d given her heart to speak so cruelly of her would have been bad enough, but then it got worse. Much worse. She closed her eyes but could not shut out the memories of stammering. Of slipping in the mud. Of their mockery. &#x201c;Her feet are as tangled as her tongue.&#x201d; The sounds of their laughter still echoed in her head. She could almost taste the hot, salty tears that had burned in her throat and eyes. She&#x2019;d wanted to crawl under her bed and never come out.<br><br>Only one man had helped her. She&#x2019;d been too embarrassed to look at him, but she remembered the kindness&#x2014;not pity&#x2014;in his voice and the comforting strength of his callused hand. She frowned. Strange to think that her gallant knight had been a MacGregor.<br><br>She&#x2019;d missed the chaos that had followed her departure from the pavilion, but later her brother had told her what had happened. Alasdair Roy MacGregor and his men had escaped right out from under his nose, and Jamie had been none too happy about it. What Jamie couldn&#x2019;t understand was why the outlaw had risked discovery to come to her assistance in the first place. She didn&#x2019;t know, either, but she would be forever grateful for his act of kindness.<br><br>She sensed that Jamie knew more about the man who&#x2019;d helped her than he&#x2019;d let on, but perhaps because he could sense her interest, he&#x2019;d held his tongue, refusing to satisfy her curiosity about the gallant outlaw.<br><br>She&#x2019;d put an end to the betrothal with John Montgomery immediately, too ashamed to tell her family the particulars. But when he&#x2019;d been maimed in an attack not long afterward, losing an ear and part of his sword arm, Lizzie wondered if her family had discovered something on their own. She had not wished him ill but knew that nothing she could have said would have stopped her family from exacting retribution. They were much too protective of her. Perhaps that was part of the problem&#x2014;the Campbells were an intimidating lot.<br><br>Lizzie had put the unpleasantness behind her and tried to forget, but sometimes, like now, it would come back to her in a vivid wave as if it had been yesterday. And when word spread that once again the Earl of Argyll was seeking an alliance for his oft-betrothed cousin, the whispering would start all over again.<br><br>She dreaded the conversation with her cousin, knowing that she would no longer be able to keep secret the extent of her foolishness with John.<br><br>Though her cousin Archie hadn&#x2019;t come out and said marriage was his intent, Lizzie had read between the lines of his letter. She lifted the parchment to the window once again, the bold black scratches of ink revealing far more than what was written.<br><br>My dear cousin,<br><br>Summer is fast upon us. I request the pleasure of your company at Dunoon as soon as possible to discuss a matter of some import. As we discussed last winter, for your kindness following the death of the countess last year and your attention to little Archie and the girls, I&#x2019;ve gifted you with a sizeable parcel of land.<br><br>Archibald, 7th Earl of Argyll<br><br>More land. How humiliating. Despite her cousin&#x2019;s claim, Lizzie knew that her help following the death of the countess wasn&#x2019;t the real reason for the gift. Archie obviously thought he needed to sweeten the pot to get someone to marry her. No doubt he was only trying to help, but her tocher was already one of the richest in the land; wasn&#x2019;t that enough?<br><br>Her shoulders sagged. Apparently not.<br><br>Part of this was her own fault. Summer, she&#x2019;d promised. Could it be June already? When her cousin had broached the subject of another betrothal all those months ago during the Yule celebration, the days were still short and the snow blanketing the moors of Inveraray Castle still comfortably deep. Summer had seemed so far away. There had seemed plenty of time to find a suitable man on her own. Plenty of time in which to fall in love.<br><br>After the travesty of her last betrothal, she&#x2019;d vowed to marry only for love&#x2014;what she thought she&#x2019;d found with John. But it had been a foolish girl&#x2019;s vow. A vow made when her emotions were still raw and tender from his cruelty.<br><br>Now, two years later, Lizzie had to be practical. At six and twenty, love probably wasn&#x2019;t for her.<br><br>Probably.<br><br>She sighed at her own foolishness. Even with reality staring her in the face, she could not completely shed the possibility from her mind. But it was well past time to give up that particular fantasy. She didn&#x2019;t want to live her life alone. Taking care of her cousin&#x2019;s and brother&#x2019;s households would not be enough forever, and as much as she loved little Archie and the girls, the children were not hers. She wanted a home and family of her own&#x2014;enough to accept a new betrothal brokered by her cousin.<br><br>She felt a twinge of regret, thinking of her friends&#x2019; happiness, then quickly pushed it aside. Her two closest friends, Meg Mackinnon and Flora MacLeod, had both been fortunate enough to find love with their husbands. Ironically, Meg had married Flora&#x2019;s brother Alex. Meg had two young sons, and Flora had recently given birth to twins. Lizzie was happy for them, but it made her deeply aware of all that she was missing.<br><br>But as much as she wanted what her friends had found, she had to accept that she could not wait any longer for something that might never happen.<br><br>It doesn&#x2019;t matter, she told herself, determined as always to make the best of every situation. I will make my own happiness. Arranged marriage or not.<br><br>&#x201c;Is something wrong, mistress?&#x201d;<br><br>Lost in thought, Lizzie hadn&#x2019;t realized that Alys had been watching her again. She lifted a brow. &#x201c;I thought you were embroidering?&#x201d;<br><br>This time Alys would not be put off. Curiosity, it seemed, had finally overridden discretion. &#x201c;You keep staring at that letter as if it&#x2019;s an execution warrant.&#x201d;<br><br>A wry smile curved Lizzie&#x2019;s mouth. &#x201c;Nothing as dramatic as that, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d; The earl would be angry, but not with her.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you worried about the travel with all those horrid MacGregors scurrying about the countryside?&#x201d; Alys leaned across and patted her knee. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to worry about. My Donnan will see that we come to no harm.&#x201d;<br><br>Alys&#x2019;s husband was captain of the earl&#x2019;s guardsmen at Castle Campbell, and she was fiercely proud of the formidable warrior.<br><br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not the travel,&#x201d; Lizzie assured her. They were well protected by a dozen guardsmen, and not even the outlawed MacGregors would dare attack the Earl of Argyll&#x2019;s carriage. Besides, they were still in the Lowlands, well away from the Lomond Hills, where the proscribed clan was reputed to have fled following the battle of Glenfruin.<br><br>Even as news of the atrocities committed by the MacGregors at Glenfruin spread through the Highlands, it was hard for Lizzie to reconcile the man who&#x2019;d come to her aid with the band of ruthless outlaws who&#x2019;d perpetrated a massacre on the field of Glenfruin. In this, however, she was alone in her family. Her cousin had been charged by King James to bring the MacGregors to justice for their crimes and for the past few years had made it his mission. A mission in which her brothers Jamie and Colin had joined. It was only a matter of time before the outlaws were all hunted down.</p><h2>The Dangerous Protector (Pocket Star Books Romance)</h2><p><b><i>Janet Chapman returns to the breathtaking Maine coast in Seductive Impostor the second novel featuring two passionate sisters . . . and the men who have what it takes to love them. <br><br></i></b>Willow Foster is committed to protecting Maine&#x2019;s precious coastline. She&#x2019;s equally committed to avoiding her one-time fling, Duncan Ross, the rugged Scotsman who&#x2019;s got her hometown believing she&#x2019;s the love of his life. But when Willow goes home to uncover the mystery behind a worrisome lobster catch, she learns that pub owner Duncan holds some mysteries of his own . . . and that taking a chance with her heart might open her life up to passion beyond her wildest dreams.</p><p>A native of rural central Maine, Janet Chapman (1956&#x2013;2017) lived in a cozy log cabin on a lake with her husband, three cats, and a stay young bull moose. The author of the hugely popular Highlander time-travel series, she also wrote numerous contemporary romances.Coastal Maine serves as the appealing backdrop for this charming but clich�d novel of romantic suspense from Chapman <i>(The Seductive Imposter)</i>. When a lobsterman alerts state Assistant Attorney General Willow Foster to the presence of contaminants in Puffin Harbor, she begins a secret investigation. She's unofficially assisted by bar owner and former salvager Duncan Ross, whose offers of both marriage and passion she's been resisting since a one-night stand 18 months earlier. As the two explore both the corporate paper trail and the local seascape, Duncan reveals that he's actually a Scottish lord, while Willow is forced to grapple with her fear of commitment. The story's use of old-fashioned romantic conventions often seems silly in this modern context. Corporate polluters call their victims "Miss," while Duncan's sister's Internet lover arrives from New Zealand carrying family heirlooms to ask for permission to court. Chapman's mimicry of Duncan's brogue is also unfortunate, making him sound more like Popeye ("Can ya climb with yar splint?") than an aristocratic adventurer. This novel works best when it focuses on the timeless bonds between friends and family, community and place. <i>Agent, Grace Morgan Literary Agency.

In the <i>Summa</i> Aquinas works to save and purify the thought of the Greeks and the Arabs in the higher light of Christian Revelation, confident that all that had been rational in the ancient philosophers and their followers would become more rational within Christianity. This exposition and defense of divine truth has two main parts: the consideration of that truth that faith professes and reason investigates, and the consideration of the truth that faith professes and reason is not competent to investigate. The exposition of truths accessible to natural reason occupies Aquinas in the first three books of the <i>Summa</i>. His method is to bring forward demonstrative and probable arguments, some of which are drawn from the philosophers, to convince the skeptic. In the fourth book of the <i>Summa</i> St. Thomas appeals to the authority of the Sacred Scripture for those divine truths that surpass the capacity of reason. The present volume is the second part of a treatise on the hierarchy of creation, the divine providence over all things, and man&#x2019;s relation to God. Book 1 of the <i>Summa</i> deals with God; Book 2, Creation; and Book 4, Salvation.</p><p>St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) is a Doctor of the church. He was an Italian Dominican friar and Roman Catholic priest who was an influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism. Canonized in 1323 by Pope John XXII, Aquinas was the foremost classical proponent of natural theology and the father of Thomism.</p><h2>Marbled, Swirled, And Layered: 150 Recipes and Variations for Artful Bars, Cookies, Pies, Cakes, and More</h2><p><b>Incredible desserts with layers and swirls of flavor that are beautiful and delicious--inside and out</b><br><br> When you marble, layer, and swirl doughs, batters, toppings, or frostings, good looks and good taste come together in one total package.

Some of the recipes will challenge even the chef&#x2019;s professional peers, but a few will prove attractive and intriguing to the everyday home baker. The sharply defined pinwheel effect of his cinnamon honey bun cookies can be duplicated with some practice and patience. Lin&#x2019;s sense of humor extends to a cake that duplicates commercial cream-filled chocolate cupcakes. Every recipe has one or two variations that transform flavors from the basic version.

Her show, <em>Fresh Air with Terry Gross</em>, a weekday magazine of contemporary arts and issues produced by WHYY in Philadelphia, is one of National Public Radio's most popular programs. More than four million people tune in to the show, which is broadcast on over 400 NPR stations across the country.<br><br>Gross is known for her thoughtful, probing interviewing style. In her trusted company, even the most reticent guest relaxes and opens up. But Gross doesn't shy away from controversy, and her questions can be tough--too tough, apparently, for Bill O'Reilly, who abruptly terminated his conversation with her. Her interview with Gene Simmons of Kiss, which is included in the book, prompted Entertainment Weekly to name Simmons its male "Crackpot of the Year."<br><br>For <em>All I Did Was Ask</em>, Gross has selected more than three dozen of her best interviews--ones of lasting relevance that are as lively on the page as they were on the air. Each is preceded by a personal introduction in which she reveals why a particular guest was on the show and the thinking behind some of her questions. And in an introductory chapter, the normally self-effacing Gross does something you're unlikely ever to hear her do on <em>Fresh Air</em>--she discusses her approach to interviewing, revealing a thing or two about herself in the bargain.<br><br>The collection focuses on luminaries from the art and entertainment world, including actors, comedians, writers, visual artists, and musicians, such as:<br><br> <ul> <li>Conan O'Brien </li><li>Chris Rock </li><li>Michael Caine </li><li>Dennis Hopper </li><li>Dustin Hoffman </li><li>Jodie Foster </li><li>John Updike </li><li>Mary Karr </li><li>Mario Puzo </li><li>Nick Hornby </li><li>Chuck Close </li><li>Eric Clapton </li><li>George Clinton </li><li>Sonny Rollins </li><li>Samuel L.

That kingdom was called Mexico. It had a magnificent castle, a beautiful princess and a tall, handsome prince; he was noble and idealistic, he had fire in his heart, but he was weak and gullible. A fool, some would say. One day, when he was still a teenager, he wrote, &#34;Ambition is like the balloonist. To some extent, the rise is nice and he does enjoy a splendid view and a vast landscape. But when he rises more, vertigo occurs, the air becomes thin and the risk of a big fall increases.&#34; With this parable, the Austrian Archduke Maximilian of Hapsburg inadvertently predicted the destiny to which he would bravely ride, despite the warnings and the sweet talkers. In any case, he followed his heart�s mandate. And Charlotte, the princess, was &#34;one of the most cultured and beautiful&#34; in Europe. Since she was a girl she&#39;d known that one day she would become a queen or an empress. When it was first hinted that they would be offered the crown of Mexico, she was 22 and he was 28, and they were surrounded by the intrigue and ambition of their own brothers, who could not wait to have them removed from the picture. So when, three years later, the couple received the official diplomatic mission which affirmed Mexico required their presence, the proposition was like a fairy tale come true. In the imagination of the era, Mexico was the distant paradise described by the great geographer Alexander von Humboldt: thick jungles and forests, steaming volcanoes, copious gold and silver mines, infinite beaches and exotic birds. &#34;The most dangerous worldview is the worldview of those who have not viewed the world,&#34; the Prussian explorer had written, and Max believed it in all sincerity and contemplated the adventure with the eyes of his soul. In Mexico, the reality was different from the imagination. It was too late by the time they realized they had been seduced by sirens, specifically the siren sitting upon the throne of France, Napoleon III. The zealous emperor frowned at the expansion of the US and the Protestant, Anglo-Saxon race. But there were also the vast territories of northern Mexico to consider, the gold and silver mines, plus Napoleon�s vague idea of rebuilding the Latin race and culture in the Americas. With that in mind, he brought two puppets to his global stage, Maximilian and Charlotte, and made sure they were told that the Mexican people would tender unto them a carpet of roses as soon as they saw their royal feet touch their land. In their dreams, Max of Austria and Charlotte of Belgium would become the saviors of the ancient empire of Montezuma, now unable to govern itself, and on the road to self-destruction. But Maximilian was not thinking of conquest and looting, as did his ancestor, Charles I of Spain, but in reconstruction and healing. It is not that he was guilty of arrogance, either. Sending a European monarch to the American continent sounds outrageous these days, but at the time, it was common for the kings of England, Belgium, Greece or Bulgaria to be of other nationalities. Still, Maximilian refused to accept the throne of Mexico until he was shown evidence that the Mexicans agreed. When he was shown a pretend plebiscite, he agreed on the dangerous adventure. The tragedy of Maximilian and Charlotte was romantic and political. In Mexico�s official history, the one recorded by the winners, they were an affront to independence and a symbol of European arrogance. For the monarchies of Europe, they are a sad and embarrassing memory, because of the abandonment, craftiness and treachery they lived through.</p><p></p><h2>Thicker Than Water (A Leo Waterman Mystery)</h2><p><p>Hard living collects its fair share of casualties, but somehow Leo Waterman avoided becoming one of them. Destined for a trust fund that was taking too damn long to kick in, he spent years eking out a living in Seattle as a private investigator. Along the way he managed to survive countless run-ins with murderers, drug dealers, and jealous wives. But when Rebecca, the love of his life, dumped him to marry someone else...that was a different story. Still, he took it like a man, eventually collecting his family money and slipping into semi- retirement&#x2014;until the day an unwelcome visitor brings him the worst possible news. Rebecca has vanished and no one, not even her manipulative, overprotective mother, can find a trace of her. Together with his band of informers and sidekicks (in truth a rather motley crew of homeless drunks and reprobates), Leo wades back into the game, determined to save Rebecca once and for all. But her trail is a twisted one, thick with deception and depravity that winds from the rain-swept streets of Seattle to the murky depths of the great North Woods. The stink of it all seems to emanate from none other than Rebecca&#x2019;s new husband, Brett Ward, whose tangle of lies will cast Leo into the path of a ruthless gang that will stop at nothing&#x2014;not even murder&#x2014;to protect what&#x2019;s theirs.</p></p><p>&#34;What are the best private eye novels you haven&#39;t read?

Celia Davies gazed down at her patient, a delicate Chinese girl whose skin displayed more bruises than unblemished flesh, and wondered if today would prove to be one of those days.</p><p>&#x201c;You heal.&#x201d; The old woman who&#x2019;d been watching from the doorway flapped wrinkled hands, causing the lengthy twist of her silver-tinged ebony hair to swing across her chest. &#x201c;You heal!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I shall try,&#x201d; Celia answered. &#x201c;I shall try my best.&#x201d;</p><p>Celia leaned over the girl, a bead of perspiration trickling down her spine. It was stifling and gloomy in this airless room no larger than a closet, devoid of any furnishings beyond a washstand, a rickety bamboo stool, and the miserable cot the girl lay upon.</p><p>A room as tight and dark as a coffin.</p><p>&#x201c;I have come to help you,&#x201d; Celia said, though the prostitute likely could not hear or understand. There was a purple bruise along her collarbone, just above the neckband of her blue cotton sacque, and several more along her chin and cheekbone. One skinny arm was wrapped in filthy, bloodstained bandages. The girl&#x2019;s face was sticky with dried sweat, and she whimpered drowsily. Undoubtedly, she had been dosed with opium for the pain. Celia rested a hand upon the girl&#x2019;s forehead. Hot but not dangerously so. Not yet.</p><p>&#x201c;She may have inflammation from her wounds. It is bad. <i>Yau peng,</i>&#x201d; she said to the old woman waiting by the open door with its lattice-barred window.</p><p>The brothel owner&#x2019;s hands had returned to the wide sleeves of her high-necked silk tunic, and her features creased with a frown. How much, Celia wondered, did this girl owe her in exchange for passage from China? Two hundred dollars? Three? Her freedom had been signed away in a contract she probably had not been able to read and might never escape. These girls came here by the dozens, sometimes sold by their own desperately poor families in China who thought they were sending their daughters to a better world, to Gam Saan, the Golden Mountain. Instead they were gathered at the docks and locked in barracoons, stripped and sold at auction, and relegated to the worst servitude a female could endure.</p><p>Celia settled onto the bamboo stool and undid the latch on the black leather portmanteau she used as a medical bag. More droplets of sweat collected beneath her collar, in the pits of her arms, and along her ribs where her corset hugged. She longed for a breath of air.</p><p>&#x201c;When did this happen?&#x201d; she asked, feeling for a pulse in the girl&#x2019;s wrist. Weak and fast. Not unexpected. &#x201c;How many days? <i>Yat.</i>&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Saam yat.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Did she mean three entire days? Celia wished Barbara were here to talk to the woman. But her half-Chinese cousin had not been home when Celia had been summoned and had rushed to the stews in China Alley with only her portmanteau as company.</p><p>&#x201c;You should have sent for me before now,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>The Chinese woman&#x2019;s expression, stoic and implacable, hardened. &#x201c;You heal or you go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do not intend to let her die.&#x201d;</p><p>Swiping the cuff of her sleeve across her forehead, Celia set out the clean cloth she&#x2019;d had the foresight to bring and spread her tools upon it&#x2014;a small pair of scissors and forceps. Fresh muslin and linen for the dressing. Carbolic acid for cleaning the lacerations.</p><p>Celia unwound the bandage covering the girl&#x2019;s arm. It adhered to the wound, which stank when she peeled the last of the cloth away. The wound was extensive, suppurating, its edges jagged. The tissue was brown instead of healthy pink, and clotted with blood. Bits of torn clothing were stuck in the gashes.</p><p>Gently, she turned the girl&#x2019;s arm over, looking for redness along its length, the sign of a dangerous spread of purulent matter in the blood. In the shadowy gloom the extent of the inflammation was difficult to determine, the angry purple bruises too many and too great. She must have attempted to fend off the blows. Celia suspected she would also find bruises on the girl&#x2019;s torso. The strikes her customer had landed&#x2014;with a heavy belt buckle, if Celia had to guess&#x2014;had been unrelenting and could have killed her immediately. Might still kill her, despite Celia&#x2019;s best efforts.</p><p>A young woman had appeared in the doorway. Two long braids hung beneath a dirty gingham handkerchief tied over her hair, and her hands plucked anxiously at the hem of her shabby tunic. The girl&#x2014;small boned, pretty&#x2014;was another of the many prostitutes imprisoned within this building.</p><p>&#x201c;I need clean water,&#x201d; Celia said to her. <i>&#x201c;Ts&#x2019;eng shui.&#x201d;</i> Given the stench of sewage wafting through the open door, she might as well ask for the moon.</p><p>The prostitute gathered the filthy bandages and scurried off to fetch water.</p><p>Celia brushed her patient&#x2019;s hair away from her face. The girl groaned and twisted away from her touch.</p><p>&#x201c;Shh,&#x201d; said Celia. &#x201c;I am here to help you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You heal or you go,&#x201d; the old woman repeated.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I shall try,&#x201d; she answered firmly. That was all she&#x2019;d ever sought to do&#x2014;help, heal. But a brothel in Chinatown was worlds away from her childhood home in England and her youthful attempts to bandage the scrapes suffered by the neighbor&#x2019;s barn cat or mend the broken wings of birds.</p><p>&#x201c;Here. Water.&#x201d;</p><p>The other young woman had returned with a tin basin, water sloshing over the rim. She set it on the floor next to Celia&#x2019;s feet and stood back. There were tears in her eyes as she looked down at Celia&#x2019;s patient. It would be hard to be a friend in this place. Hard when life was so uncertain and far too short.</p><p>Celia started to work, first cleaning the wound as best she could, flushing it with generous amounts of water to remove the loose debris and pus. The runoff splashed onto the dirt floor at her feet, splattering her boots, dirtying her stockings. The prostitute standing in the doorway murmured to the elderly woman, sounding distressed. Her anxiety for her friend received a sharp reprimand. There was no pity to be found here, and less room for affection.</p><p>&#x201c;Unh.&#x201d; The patient&#x2019;s eyelids fluttered as she tried to open them.</p><p>&#x201c;Hurt?&#x201d; asked her friend, shuffling forward.</p><p>&#x201c;What I am doing hurts only a little,&#x201d; Celia reassured her. &#x201c;The flesh is too decayed to have much feeling in it.&#x201d;</p><p>Using her forceps to grasp the diseased tissue, she retrieved the scissors and cut away as much flesh as she could manage. The wound began to bleed anew, which she took as a good sign. The other prostitute decided she could stand no more and ran off, her footsteps echoing down the alleyway. When Celia finished, she cleaned the gash with the carbolic and packed the wound with a pad of linen. She would not stitch it closed or cover it with a plaster. It needed a chance to heal, and sealing in the putrefaction would only guarantee the girl&#x2019;s death.</p><p>&#x201c;It must be kept clean. Wash it. <i>Sai,</i>&#x201d; she said to the elderly woman as she bandaged the arm. &#x201c;Change the dressing every day.&#x201d; From her bag, Celia extracted a small envelope. &#x201c;This is quinine. She must be given a grain every three to four hours.&#x201d; She held up fingers, trying to explain. &#x201c;For the fever.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman took the envelope and tucked it into a pocket hidden beneath her tunic.</p><p>&#x201c;Send a message if she worsens,&#x201d; Celia added.</p><p>&#x201c;You go now,&#x201d; the brothel owner demanded, and stalked off.</p><p>Celia stared at the empty doorway, saw a drunk laborer shuffle past and down the alleyway, heard the call of prostitutes. No matter how long she stared, though, the woman would not be reappearing, her concern limited for a girl she considered little more than damaged merchandise.</p><p>Celia washed her hands and returned her supplies to the medical bag. Collecting her bonnet, she glanced at her patient one last time before hastening out into the alleyway.</p><p>The incessant spring winds had died down, leaving the air heavy with the reek of clogged sewer drains and the cloying sweetness of incense burning in a nearby joss house. She could hold her breath, but she couldn&#x2019;t avoid hearing the muffled noises emanating from behind the closed doors that lined the passageway.</p><p>The alley widened as Celia walked on, the prostitutes&#x2019; rooms replaced by apartments and small shops. Overnight rain had left muddy puddles in the street. Hoisting her skirts, she hopped from one dry spot to the next. A porter squeezed past, the bamboo pole he&#x2019;d slung over his shoulders curving from heavily laden baskets on either end. She skidded as she attempted to jump out of his path, her feet sinking to her ankles in slimy water.</p><p>&#x201c;Gad!&#x201d; <i>Brilliant, Celia.</i></p><p>At the sound of her voice, the local constable who always offered to act as an escort straightened from where he had been leaning against a telegraph pole. He pulled the cigarette he&#x2019;d been smoking from his mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;You done, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Constable.&#x201d; She stepped up to him, her feet squelching in her boots. &#x201c;Thank you for waiting.&#x201d;</p><p>They headed for Washington Street, the constable eyeing every Chinese person they passed. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t smart to come here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do believe, Constable, that makes the tenth time you have made that observation,&#x201d; she said, with a slight smile. He meant no harm.</p><p>&#x201c;I keep hopin&#x2019; you&#x2019;ll get some sense.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Most of these women are uncomfortable leaving Chinatown, so I have to come to them,&#x201d; Celia explained. &#x201c;I do not know what else I could do.&#x201d;</p><p>The look he gave her suggested he could think of a whole host of things a proper lady should be doing besides tending prostitutes, and Celestials at that. It was not the first time he had given her that look, either.</p><p>They reached Washington Street. &#x201c;I will be safe from here, Constable. Again, thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded and strolled off, his head swiveling as he peered into every doorway, searching for drunks or gamblers to apprehend. The farther he walked without finding any, the more his shoulders sagged with disappointment.</p><p>Celia took one last glance back at the alleyway. In the distance, the old woman leaned through a ground-floor window, checking that Celia had left without taking any of the girls with her. As if there were someplace Celia could readily hide a girl from the owner who controlled her life.</p><p>As if there were someplace safe for any of them.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Celia hailed the horsecar running along the rails laid down on Stockton, its yellow coach a bright splash of color against the brick buildings and gray macadam. A ride when she was less than a mile from home was a real treat, but as her housekeeper would say in her Scottish brogue, &#x201c;We didna come to America to kill ourselves.&#x201d;</p><p>It was nearly seven years to the day since she had arrived in America with a husband and a dream. She had lost one. She clung fiercely to the other.</p><p>The driver reined in the horse, bringing the omnibus to a halt. She waited for the steps to clear of departing passengers and idly observed the busy streets around her. Across the way, the corner tobacconist closed his shop, shoving back the awning with a bang, and a newspaper boy called out the last copies of the <i>Evening Bulletin</i>. An elderly Chinese woman clattered past in her satin shoes with thick soles of felt and wood, silver anklets jangling. She disappeared into the shadows of the alley Celia had just left. The day&#x2019;s activities were winding down, while soon the restaurants, <i>lagerbier</i> saloons, and gambling dens of the Barbary would be in full swing. And in the morning there might be new patients like the girl Celia had left moaning on a filthy cot.</p><p>Celia climbed aboard and paid her five cents to the conductor, who recorded her payment with his gang punch. The car was as crowded as ever, having come from the businesses along Market Street, and noisy with voices speaking a myriad of tongues. Several men stood hanging on to straps suspended from the ceiling. One or two eyed her outfit and the portmanteau in her hand. She could almost hear their thoughts: <i>One of that sort of women, looking for rights. Next they&#x2019;ll be asking for the vote, too, just like the negroes.</i></p><p>Gazing coolly at them, she noticed that a gentleman in a stovepipe hat had risen to offer her a seat. He, apparently, was not alarmed by a woman toting a medical bag. Celia thanked him and sank onto the bench between a matron whose hooped dress spread across two spaces and a man fast asleep. The woman pursed her lips as her regard settled on Celia&#x2019;s muddy boots. Hastily, Celia tucked them beneath the hem of her equally muddy petticoats.</p><p>She had closed her eyes for only a second, it seemed, when someone called her name.</p><p>&#x201c;Signora Davies. You come from a patient?&#x201d;</p><p>Her neighbor, Maria Cascarino, occupied the bench opposite. Celia must have been exhausted to have missed her, a stout woman wearing a floral print skirt, her usual bright red shawl tucked around her white blouse. Perhaps Celia had not noticed Mrs. Cascarino without all of her children clinging to her skirts. Today only her youngest boy, Angelo, was at her side, kicking his heels.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I have done, Mrs. Cascarino. I am sorry I did not notice you. It has been a very long and tiring day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is fine. I know you work hard.&#x201d; She ruffled the mop of dark hair atop Angelo&#x2019;s head. He must have misplaced his cap again. &#x201c;We come from the city to buy shoes.&#x201d; She motioned toward the scuffed brogans on the young boy&#x2019;s feet. They looked far too large for a six-year-old. &#x201c;Seventy-five cents. For old shoes! We cannot buy better.&#x201d;</p><p>Celia&#x2019;s gaze lingered on Maria Cascarino&#x2019;s hand. It had come to rest upon Angelo&#x2019;s shoulder, drawing his warm body snug against her side, the familiar itch of his wool jacket beneath her fingers. Celia buffed a thumb across her wedding band and felt an empty, hollow longing, which she quickly snuffed.</p><p>&#x201c;Your shoes look very sturdy and fine, Angelo,&#x201d; said Celia, making the boy grin and kick his heels faster.</p><p>Mrs. Cascarino smiled at her, crinkling the skin around her eyes. She often smiled, though she and her husband both claimed they had seen horrible things during the Risorgimento, the wars of Italian independence from Austria, which were still being fought, and the reason they had fled Italy almost twenty years ago, an infant girl in tow.</p><p>&#x201c;But your patient, she is better?&#x201d; the other woman asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I have done what I could for her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>S�.</i> You always do the best.&#x201d; She glanced down at Angelo, whose large eyes blinked at Celia, and her smile faltered. &#x201c;Do you see my daughter?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was in the Chinese quarter, Signora Cascarino. Not near her place of employment.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Cascarino clicked her tongue against her teeth. &#x201c;That Mina,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We worry for her.&#x201d;</p><p><i>I would worry for her, too, if she were my daughter. </i>As far as Celia knew, however, Mina Cascarino did nothing more than sing at the saloon where she worked. A situation far better than what other girls like Mina could claim.</p><p>&#x201c;Mina is a good girl,&#x201d; said Celia.</p><p>Mrs. Cascarino eyed her. &#x201c;My Mina? You are kind to say, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She looked out the window beh...</p></p><h2>Presenting with Credibility: Practical Tools and Techniques for Effective Presentations</h2><p>Credibility is the most important aspect of presenting.

Through years of judicious sidestepping and heroic indolence, this barman has successfully avoided the demands of parents, landlords, neighbours and women. But suddenly one unforeseen incident after another seems to threaten his idyllic and rather peaceable existence. He has an encounter with a decidedly unfriendly dog, his parents threaten to descend on Berlin from the provinces, and he meets a dangerously attractive woman who throws his emotional life into confusion. Berlin Blues is a richly entertaining evocation of life in the city and a classic of modern-day decadence.</p><p>A clever and hilarious tragicomic novel of life in the bars of Berlin, Berlin Blues has been a bestseller in Germany and a film of the novel will be released later this year.Sven Regener is the lead singer and songwriter of the band Element of Crime. Berlin Blues is his first novel.</p><h2>Kenneth Fearing: Selected Poems: (American Poets Project #8)</h2><p>Poet, journalist, and crime novelist, Kenneth Fearing wrote poems filled with the jargon of advertising and radio broadcasts and tabloid headlines, sidewalk political oratory, and the pop tunes on the jukebox. Seeking out what he called &#x201c;the new and complex harmonies . . . of a strange and still more complex age,&#x201d; he evoked the jitters of the Depression and the war years in a voice alternately sardonic and melancholy, and depicted a fragmenting urban world bombarded by restless desires and unnerving fears.<br><br>But, in the words of editor Robert Polito, &#x201c;Fearing&#x2019;s poems carry no whiff of the curio or relic. If anything, his poems . . . insinuated an emerging media universe that poetry still only fitfully acknowledges.&#x201d; This new selection foregrounds the energy and originality of Fearing&#x2019;s prophetic poetry, with its constant formal experimenting and its singular note of warning: &#x201c;We must be prepared for anything, anything, anything.&#x201d; As a chronicler of mass culture and its discontents, Fearing is a strangely solitary figure who cannot be ignored.<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p><b><i>Robert Polito</i></b>&nbsp;is a poet, biographer, and critic.

The perpetrators were never apprehended and thirteen people connected to the crime were murdered in homicides that, like the crime itself, remain unsolved to this day. The burglary has fascinated the public for years, dominating headlines around the globe due to the story&#x2019;s unending ravel of mysteries that baffled the authorities, it being the subject of two different TV movies and a centerpiece of Martin Scorsese&#x2019;s iconic gangster film Goodfellas. <br><br>One of the organizers of the sensational burglary, Henry Hill, who passed away in 2012, in collaboration with Daniel Simone, has penned an unprecedented &#x201c;tell-all&#x201d; about the robbery with never-before-unveiled details, particulars only known to an insider.&nbsp;<br>In 2013, this infamous criminal act again flared up in the national news when five reputed gangsters were charged in connection to the robbery. This latest twist lends the project an extraordinary sense of timing, and the legal proceedings of the newly arrested suspects will unfold over the next eighteen months, continuing to keep the Lufthansa topic in the news.The late Henry Hill entered the Federal Witness Protection Program in 1980 and assisted the government in building cases against forty-six top Mafia associates, severely wounding the major five gangland organizations. He collaborated with author Nick Pileggi on the book Wiseguy, which became a New York Times #1 Best Seller. In 1990, Nick Pileggi and Martin Scorsese adapted Wiseguy to a screenplay, and with Henry Hill&#x2019;s guidance, Mr. Scorsese directed the film. Until he died in 2012, Henry Hill toured the country on speaking engagements lecturing high school students not to emulate his past life and career. <br><br>Daniel Simone is a writer who has co-written autobiographies and published numerous shorter pieces on prominent figures in film, theater, and fiction. He created and wrote a monthly feature for Long Island Pulse magazine called &#x201c;Between the Lines&#x201d; where he interviewed and profiled renowned novelists. In September of 2012, he appeared in the one-hour Biography Channel documentary Mobsters:Jimmythe GentBurke, which centered on the life and career of Jimmy Burke.</p><h2>New Moon with the Old</h2><p><p>From the author of<strong>I Capture the Castle</strong>and<strong>The Hundred and One Dalmatians</strong>, an unusual adventure in which humour and more than a touch of strangeness are inextricably blended.</p><p>When Jane Minton arrives at Dome House as a secretary-housekeeper, she finds herself sharing the comfortable country home of four attractive young people. Their charming widower father, Rupert Carrington is too occupied with his London business to see very much of them. Richard, the eldest, is a composer; Clare, whose true talents (if they can be called that) have not yet disclosed themselves, dreams of courtly romance; Drew is collecting material for a novel; and Merry, still at school, has her heart set on a stage career. Jane is warmly welcomed into this happy household and feels her luck is too good to be true.</p><p>However, the private world of Dome House is fated to break up as Rupert flees England under threat of prosecution for fraud. He asks Jane to break the news to the children, who must now fend for themselves, and to do what she can to help them.

He couldn&#x2019;t wait to touch her, her smooth, fair skin, skim his fingers over her red lips, kiss her.<br><br>Joanna&#x2019;s beauty was just part of her attraction. She was the only woman in the world who truly understood him. And when they finally met in the flesh for the first time, she&#x2019;d know instantly that Aaron was her true love.<br><br>Just like he knew when he first saw her picture two years ago. When he read her books. When he learned everything about her.<br><br>When he killed for her.<br><br>They were soul mates. Every word she wrote, she crafted for him. Every story she told, she told just for him. Like in Act Naturally.<br><br>He pulled the battered book from his backpack. He&#x2019;d stolen it from a library last week, shortly after the quake and their escape. It had physically pained him to leave all his Joanna Sutton books behind in his cell, but he didn&#x2019;t have a choice. The earthquake had hit when his cell block inmates were on the exercise yard at San Quentin State Prison. He&#x2019;d been standing alone thinking (of course) about Joanna. Doug Chapman was only a couple of feet away sneaking a smoke&#x2014;much easier when it was so cold you could see your breath&#x2014;and then the ground shook. Aaron had lived in California for years, but never realized how loud earthquakes were when you were at the epicenter. He and Doug saw the breech in the wall and they went over it as soon as they could move. No looking back, no stopping when the guards shouted. Aaron watched one of his fellow prisoners, a cold bastard named Theodore Glenn, kill one of the injured guards. Still, he kept going.<br><br>Aaron knew immediately where he was headed. Montana. To be with Joanna.<br><br>He&#x2019;d taken three of her paperback novels from the library because they didn&#x2019;t have the security sensors in the spine and he could easily hide them in his jacket. He wished he had more.<br><br>He opened it to one of the many underlined passages. He&#x2019;d read the book twice since the escape last week. It made this time moving from one filthy motel room to another more bearable.<br><br>She swung her legs just enough to make the porch swing move, then tucked them beneath her, the easy rocking of the old chair comforting her. Was Garrett thinking of her? Thinking of her over thousands of miles, in the desert, serving his country. Being the hero she&#x2019;d always known he could be.<br><br>Grace took the newspaper article from her pocket. It was worn and torn from being carried everywhere, but she couldn&#x2019;t bear to part with it. Front-page headline: Hometown Hero Saves Three in Bombing.<br><br>She stared at the vast openness that was her home as tears clouded her vision. Her hand absently rested on the small swell of her stomach. How could she tell him over the phone about this new life they had created? Over e-mail? How could she act like everything was the same when her entire world had changed overnight?<br><br>&#x201c;Come home safe, Garrett.&#x201d;<br><br>Garrett and Grace lived happily-ever-after, and so would Aaron and Joanna. She was thinking of him right now, he could feel it. Wondering when he was going to come for her. She&#x2019;d recognize that he was her hero as soon as she saw him. She&#x2019;d kiss him, touch him, love him. She&#x2019;d stay with him forever.<br><br>I&#x2019;m almost there, Joanna.<br><br>His dick hardened and he shifted uncomfortably in the motel&#x2019;s torn vinyl chair. He shoved his hand down his pants to alleviate the discomfort, but it only made his hard-on worse and he groaned.<br><br>Aaron let himself think about Joanna as he rubbed himself. They would get married in a quiet ceremony, then he&#x2019;d take her to a secluded hideaway where they could be together. Maybe they&#x2019;d never leave. He&#x2019;d make love to her every night, and watch her write every day. They&#x2019;d be inseparable.<br><br>He groaned again and looked at the picture of Joanna, on the verge of release.<br><br>Rebecca.<br><br>Joanna&#x2019;s face morphed into the woman who had once loved him. Who had hurt him. Who had made him kill her, the bitch.<br><br>&#x201c;I love you, Rebecca. I know you love me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know it&#x2019;s not like that between us. I don&#x2019;t love you, not like that. Please don&#x2019;t do this to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean you don&#x2019;t love me? You tell me all the time you love me! Have you been lying to me? Playing with me?&#x201d;<br><br>She stared at him as if he were a stranger. Was that fear in her eyes? Why would she be scared of him? He worshipped her. Her fear made him angry. More than anger, he panicked that she would leave him.<br><br>&#x201c;Aaron, you need to go. Now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; They were in Rebecca&#x2019;s house. She&#x2019;d invited him over. He&#x2019;d been over many times.<br><br>(Only twice, and because you made her invite you in.)<br><br>Aaron stamped down the dark voice and grabbed Rebecca by the arms. &#x201c;Did someone make you deny your feelings? That asshole you&#x2019;re working with on the set, Bruce Lawson?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bruce?&#x201d; She shook her head rapidly back and forth. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about Aaron. You&#x2019;re scaring me. Please, please let me go.&#x201d;<br><br>He shook her and her hair came loose. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you understand? We were meant to be together, Rebecca.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me go!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me you love me!&#x201d;<br><br>Tears streamed down her face.<br><br>&#x201c;You love me, I know you do, just last week you said, &#x2018;I cannot imagine living another day without you.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>She blinked rapidly, confusion on her face. &#x201c;What? That was a line from my movie. What are you saying?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve known each other forever, Rebecca.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We know each other because we&#x2019;re neighbors.&#x201d; She was sobbing, her voice becoming hysterical. &#x201c;Please stop this!&#x201d; She opened her mouth and he knew she was going to scream.<br><br>A vise gripped his heart, squeezing so hard he couldn&#x2019;t breathe, he couldn&#x2019;t think, blood pumped, louder, hotter, faster, the tightness in his chest blocking out everything.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t know how the knife got into his hand. He didn&#x2019;t even remember bringing it to her house. Suddenly a long red slash cut open Rebecca&#x2019;s cheek and she was screaming, in pain and fear.<br><br>Aaron moaned, a pathetically weak sound, as he shook his head, ridding himself of the image of Rebecca&#x2019;s bloodied face. His dick had gone limp without relief. He crumbled Rebecca&#x2019;s picture and threw it against the wall.<br><br>Joanna. It wasn&#x2019;t Rebecca in the photograph, it was Joanna!<br><br>He rushed across the room and picked up the paper. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; He carefully smoothed the picture, trying to rub out the wrinkles, then refolded it, heart racing.<br><br>Joanna wasn&#x2019;t Rebecca. She wouldn&#x2019;t lie to him. Aaron had it figured out. Someone had told Rebecca to leave him. That Bruce Lawson. She hadn&#x2019;t wanted to, she&#x2019;d been manipulated.<br><br>(You killed her Aaron.)<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t want to think about that day. It depressed him because he&#x2019;d never wanted to hurt Rebecca. He&#x2019;d loved her. But she lied, and he hated liars.<br><br>(You don&#x2019;t deserve women like Rebecca. Or Joanna.)<br><br>Aaron pushed the dark thoughts from his head, sat in the uneven chair and stared at the cigarette-scarred table until his pulse slowed to normal.<br><br>A key in the door made Aaron jump and look around for escape. If it were the cops, they&#x2019;d burst in, or pound loudly, shouting their presence. Aaron swallowed his apprehension from being on the run for nearly a week.<br><br>It was Doug holding two large fast-food bags in clenched fists. Originally, after the earthquake, it seemed like a good idea to stick close to his cell neighbor Doug Chapman. He had great instincts, could hot-wire a car, and he got them a gun within twenty-four hours. But after living next to the guy in a six-by-nine-foot cell for eighteen months, and being practically tied at the hip this last week, Aaron was antsy. The last thirty minutes while Doug had been out getting food had been the first real peace he&#x2019;d had in days.<br><br>&#x201c;Fuck, Aaron, we should have gone south for the winter. I should never have listened to you.&#x201d; Doug dropped the food on the table.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re free to leave,&#x201d; Aaron said, lips tight. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you half the money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Chill, man.

He pulled off his jacket and tore open the bags. &#x201c;We caught the news while we were waiting. They caught Blackie and his gang over in San Francisco yesterday. I think O&#x2019;Brien got a little freaked someone would recognize us.&#x201d; Doug nervously ran his hands over his buzz cut, frazzled for the first time since they&#x2019;d escaped five days ago. &#x201c;That guy got them all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two guys drowned in the bay the night of the quake,&#x201d; Aaron answered. &#x201c;Your ghost didn&#x2019;t get everyone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give a fuck about them, Blackie was caught. I thought he&#x2019;d be smart, sure thing.&#x201d;<br><br>Aaron shrugged. Doug had a theory about everything, Aaron had learned since Lincoln Barnes died and Doug moved into his cell. Doug&#x2019;s current theory was that someone was tracking all the escapees&#x2014;a ghost or some avenging angel.<br><br>&#x201c;We gotta get the hell out of here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re already a thousand miles from Quentin,&#x201d; Aaron said. &#x201c;We got new clothes, some money, we&#x2019;re laying low. I have a place for us. And Blackie was a brute. He was stupid, robbing stores right and left. Aren&#x2019;t you glad I stopped you from joining their gang?&#x201d;<br><br>Doug shrugged, talking with his mouth full. &#x201c;Guess so. But I swear, I&#x2019;m gonna go down to fucking Mexico as soon as it&#x2019;s safe. Somewhere where there&#x2019;s no snow. It&#x2019;s twenty degrees out there! Twenty!&#x201d; He slurped his soda.<br><br>&#x201c;Why do we have to go in separate?&#x201d; Doug continued to complain, shoving fries into his mouth, his face low to the table as if someone would snatch his food at any moment.</p><h2>Wraeththu: The Enchantments of Flesh and Spirit, The Bewitchments of Love and Hate, The Fulfilments of Fate and Desire</h2><p><p>In this powerful and elegant story set in a future Earth very different from our own, a new kind of human has evolved to challenge the dominion of <i>Homo sapiens.</i> This new breed is stronger, smarter, and far more beautiful than their parent race, and are endowed with psychic as well as physical gifts.

In 1744, at the age of 14, she was taken by her ambitious mother--removed from her family, her religion, and her country--to a foreign land with a single goal: marry a prince and bear him an heir. Once in Russia, she changed her name, learned the language, and went on to become the world's richest and most powerful woman, ruler of its then-largest empire. She is remembered as Catherine the Great.<br><br> There may be no better author than Robert K. Massie to take on the daunting task of documenting this most rare of human lives. Massie, a former president of the Authors Guild, is a seasoned biographer of the 400-year Romanov dynasty, most notably with <em>Peter the Great: His Life and World</em>, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1981 and remains one of the most arresting biographies I've even encountered.<br><br> In his page-turning chronicle of Catherine II, Massie (now 82) compiles the most complete and compelling narrative to date of this singular woman. Married to an incompetent man-child who was unwilling or unable to help her fulfill her primary role--giving birth to a son--she ultimately grew to become a trailblazer among monarchs: friend of philosophical giants, incomparable patron of the arts, prosecutor of multiple wars, pioneer of public health, maker of kings, and prodigious serial lover.<br><br> Indeed, her accomplishments and shortcomings as an autocrat and a woman make for a remarkable saga, but that's not to say that just any author could do justice to Catherine's lasting legacy. (Many have tried.) Massie situates Catherine's early life and three-decade reign as empress amidst the tumult of the European Enlightenment, enriching his own narrative with telling excerpts of her letters and rich discussions of her political environment and personal motivations.<br><br> Put simply, Massie is just the man to take this endlessly fascinating life and craft an utterly memorable book. <em>Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman</em> is a towering accomplishment, one of the year's best books in any genre. <em>--Jason Kirk</em></p> <p><b> Featured Images from <em>Catherine the Great</em></b></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br> The imperial coronation crown designed for Catherine.

It's going to be the worst day of their lives.</em><br><br>When Shaw McBride and Romeo Zderko pull up at a convenience store off I-95 in Georgia, their only thought is to fix a leaky tire and be on their way again to Florida-away from their dull Ohio tech-support jobs. But this happens to be the store from which a 318,000,000 million dollar Jackpot ticket has just been sold -- and when a pretty clerk accidentally reveals to Shaw the identity of the winning family, he hatches a ferociously audacious scheme: He and Romeo will squeeze the family for half their prize. <br><br>That night, he visits the Boatwright home and takes the family hostage, while Romeo patrols the streets nearby, prepared to murder the Boatwrights' loved ones at any sign of resistance. At first, the family offers none. But Shaw's plot depends on maintaining constant fear-merciless, unfaltering terror-and soon, under the pressure, everyone's sanity begins to unravel . . . <br><br> At once frightening, comic, and suspenseful, RAVENS is a wholly original and utterly compelling novel from one of our most talented writers.</p><p>George Dawes Green is a highly acclaimed novelist and poet. He currently divides his time between Georgia and New York. <br><br>The Boatrights, a small-town Southern family, win $318 million, making real their dreams of the high life. Shaw and Romeo, two men who are passing through the quiet town, hear about the win and start scheming. Soon the winning ticket becomes shared earnings as a secret extortion threat hangs over the family. Robert Petkoff and Maggi-Meg Reed narrate admirably as they portray the story&#39;s characters, among them a quiet psychopath, a teenage girl, a beaten-up deputy, and a tipsy mom. However, the same characters are voiced by both narrators. Reed&#39;s voice is better suited to the women, and the deeper-voiced Petkoff should stick to the men. Nonetheless, both narrators deliver the rising tension of these intersecting lives.

His revolutionary theories are supported by his intense scrutiny of not only ancient Sumerian texts but also stone structures all over the world. The similarities and astrological significance of these formations suggests that rather than looking for guidance from leaders here on Earth, humanity should instead look to the sky for answers. <br><br><i>The Earth Chronicles</i> deal with the history and prehistory of Earth and humankind. Each book in the series is based upon information written on clay tablets by the ancient civilizations of the Near East. For the first time, the entire <i>Earth Chronicles</i> series is now available in a hardcover collector's edition.</p><p>One of the charms of Zecharia Sitchin is his tendency to take ancient writings as fact as opposed to myth. For example, according to clay tablets discovered by archeologists, Gilgamesh, a king of ancient Sumeria, was punished by the gods for raping female subjects on their wedding day--a particularly naughty, though not uncommon, pastime of ancient royalty. Snickering, the tricky gods created a double of him, which, as you can imagine, created havoc in the king's life. Some time later, directed by his goddess mother, Gilgamesh walked with his double to Lebanon to attain immortality. Sitchin ponders that perhaps the double had superhuman strength and en route built a second Stonehenge discovered in the Golan Heights by Israelis during the 1967 Six Days War. Hmmm. As Sitchin concedes, there's really no way to tell who actually built this hoary structure, but the in-depth archeological and historical research gathered here to support his musings concerning an extraterrestrial secret code to construct humankind is fascinating beyond belief. <i>--P. Randall Cohan</i>Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010) was born in Russia and grew up in Palestine, where he acquired a profound knowledge of modern and ancient Hebrew, other Semitic and European languages, the Old Testament, and the history and archaeology of the Near East. A graduate of the University of London with a degree in economic history, he worked as a journalist and editor for many years prior to undertaking his life&#x2019;s work<i>--The Earth Chronicles</i>. <br> <br>One of the few scholars able to read the clay tablets and interpret ancient Sumerian and Akkadian, Sitchin based <i>The Earth Chronicles</i> series on the texts and pictorial evidence recorded by the ancient civilizations of the Near East. His books have been widely translated, reprinted in paperback editions, converted to Braille for the blind, and featured on radio and television programs.</p><h2>The Great Bean Caper (Skippyjon Jones)</h2><p>El Bumblebeeto has stolen Los Chimichango&#39;s frijoles, and it&#39;s up to Skippyjon to get them back!

In Sweden, Austria, Italy, Spain, England, Russia, and Germany, among kings and queens, diplomats, military leaders, writers, aristocrats, and artists, French was the universal language of politics and intellectual life. In <i>When the World Spoke French</i>, Marc Fumaroli presents a gallery of portraits of Europeans and Americans who conversed and corresponded in French, along with excerpts from their letters or other writings.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; These men and women, despite their differences, were all irresistibly attracted to the ideal of human happiness inspired by the Enlightenment, whose capital was Paris and whose king was Voltaire. Whether they were in Paris or far away, speaking French connected them in spirit with all those who desired to emulate Parisian tastes, style of life, and social pleasures. Their stories are testaments to the appeal of that famous &#x201c;sweetness of life&#x201d; nourished by France and its language.&nbsp;<br></p></p><p><p>Marc Fumaroli is a scholar of French classical rhetoric and art. He is a member of the British Academy, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Soci�t� d&#x2019;histoire litt�raire de la France, and the Acad�mie fran�aise. Fumaroli received from the Acad�mie fran�aise, before being elected a member, the Monseigneur Marcel Prize in 1982 and the Critique Prize in 1992, and he is president of the Soci�t� des Amis du Louvre. He won the Balzan Prize for Literary History and Criticism in 2001, and is the author of numerous books including <i>L'�ge de l'�loquence, H�ros et orateurs, L'�cole du silence</i>, and <i>Trois institutions litt�raires</i>.<br><b><br> </b>Richard Howard received a National Book Award for his translation of <i>Les Fleurs du mal</i> and a Pulitzer Prize for <i>Untitled Subjects</i>, his third volume of poems. He is the translator of the NYRB Classics <i>Alien Hearts</i> and <i>The Unknown Masterpiece</i>.<b><br><br></b></p>"Notwithstanding the radical role it would eventually play in the French and American Revolutions, the language of Enlightenment liberalism and universalism paradoxically evinced the finest qualities of the French nobility: cleverness, leisure, cultivation and charm....Conceived as 'a portrait gallery of foreigners conquered by Enlightenment France,' Fumaroli&#x2019;s book provides biographical essays about a diverse and fascinating cast of characters....This book, however, depicts them all as wonderfully distinct individuals &#x2014; real people whose eclectic interests, messy love lives and oddball personalities square ill with the lofty philosophical abstractions &#x201c;the Enlightenment&#x201d; so often calls to mind. Fumaroli&#x2019;s Enlightenment is, first and foremost, a wild and woolly human drama, its players every bit as multifaceted (and flawed) as those making headlines today....For those looking to join this latter-day 'banquet of enlightened minds,' When the World Spoke French is an excellent place to start." -- Caroline Weber, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"When the World Spoke French is a magisterial compendium of biographical essays, written in an unhurried style and interleaved with an anthology of elegant, sometimes astringent, often effusive, antique verbiage. This grandiose elegy offers choice pleasure to readers who care to eavesdrop on the table- and pillow-talk among an impressive cast of aristocrats (local and foreign), philosophes, English expatriates, and quick-witted American arrivistes....[author Marc Fumaroli's] command of sources, his treasury of recondite detail and his narrative zest combine in a sustained celebration both of francophone intelligence and of the sexual intrigues that so often put desire and diplomacy in bed together." -- Frederic Raphael, <i>The Wall Street Journal <br></i><br>"In the 18th century, French was the language of culture and diplomacy, uniquely suited to express the wit and style of mainly European political, social, and literary luminaries, according to veteran French scholar Fumaroli.&nbsp;Letters and memoirs composed in French from major figures like Frederick II of Prussia and Catherine the Great of Russia, along with relative unknowns like Neapolitan Abb� Galiani or American Gouverneur Morris, map a trail from the enlightened salons of Paris to the partition of Poland by Prussia, Russia, and Austria in the 18th century....The smooth translation by Pulitzer winner Howard facilitates appreciation of the witty writers....Whether randomly selecting a chapter or treating the book as a saga sweeping inexorably toward the Polish debacle and the French Reign of Terror, readers cannot fail to find their own enlightenment in these gems." &#x2014; &nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;The names read like a Who&#x2019;s Who: the Viscount Bolingbroke and Lord Chesterfield of England, Prince Eugene of Savoy, Frederick the Great and Frederick Melchoir Grimm of Prussia/Germany, Catherine the Great of Russia, Gustavus III of Sweden, Benjamin Franklin and Gouverneur Morris of the United States, Stanislas II of Poland, to mention only ten of them.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Freeman G.

But it wasn&#x2019;t his first time there. Ben suffered from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a heart condition that posed a constant risk of sudden death. His condition, a thickening of the heart muscle, worsened over time, leaving him weak and fatigued. It also led Ben to some close calls medically, in particular cardiac arrest on four separate occasions, during which he felt the presence of angels and experienced the perfect peace of heaven.<br><br>Precocious and warm, Ben was close with his family and two siblings, and forged deep relationships with his friends. He loved to wakeboard and wakesurf, and he had dreams of visiting foreign countries around the world. He created the YouTube channels TotalRandomness512 and BreedloveTV, and cocreated the channel OurAdvice4You,&nbsp; where he posted videos about everything from dating advice for girls to more serious topics like his spirituality and heart condition.<br><br>Unbeknownst to his parents and family, Ben created a two-part video called &#x201c;This Is My Story,&#x201d; in which he used flash cards to tell the world about his near-death experiences and his beckoning toward heaven.<br><br>When he died a short while later at the tender age of eighteen, his family and the rest of the world stumbled upon these videos.

Copyright � The Ben Breedlove Trust, 2013.<p>Ben stepped into his bedroom, and sat down at his studio desk, taking in the sight of his personal sanctuary. He loved this room that he had inherited when Ally went off to college. In addition to the corner &#x201c;studio,&#x201d; he was surrounded by so many meaningful personal items&#x2014;a small cross given to him by some missionaries from Thailand sat on his nightstand right where the missionaries had left it for him years ago; his surfboard and wakeboard that he loved so much that he kept it in his bedroom rather than a garage or in the boat; his drumsticks, and several personal photos. This was Ben&#x2019;s place. Or, at least it had been.</p><p>His desk, still adorned with his favorite set props, was illuminated by the bright flood of his studio lighting. The gigantic green screen still hung from his bedroom wall, transforming a teenage bedroom into a professional setting. This room had set the stage for every video Ben had ever made, and it would now, for his final project. As much as he loved every second of life in this world, he had a strong feeling that it was no longer his primary residence. Ben took his seat in his studio, and settled into the limelight.</p><p>He reached in a drawer and pulled out some three by five inch blank white note cards. He found a black Sharpie and began to write.</p><p>He had seen a video on YouTube in which another teen, Kieran Miles, used note cards to express a message without ever speaking a word. Kieran shared how he had been bullied by others for most of his life, but that he was going to make it through, despite the pain and struggle. Ben was profoundly moved by Kieran&#x2019;s suffering. In fact, after discovering the video, he brought his computer into the kitchen to show it to his parents. Ben decided he had a message that could encourage people to have hope, so he wanted to express it in a similar manner as Kieran had done. In producing his own video, Ben credited Kieran as his inspiration for the flash-card form in which he presented his message.</p><p>Jake and his friend Nate popped into Ben&#x2019;s room to see what he was doing. Jake was accustomed to seeing his brother working on videos, so he wasn&#x2019;t surprised to see Ben on his computer again. Jake and Nate were more interested in tossing a ball to Chica, the Breedloves&#x2019; four-year-old, purebred Maltese, so they went into the room across the hall and didn&#x2019;t pay much attention to what Ben was doing.</p><p>Sitting in front of his green screen, the same spot where he had created videos from various &#x201c;locations&#x201d; around the world, Ben leaned in toward the camera on his computer. Normally, he made his videos with his whole set-up&#x2014;the studio, cameras, lights, with his pseudo-microphone sitting atop his desk, but not this time. For this project, Ben knelt next to his bed, and leaned in close to his laptop. He punched in the music to an instrumental version of &#x201c;Mad World&#x201d;, a song originally recorded by British new wave band, Tears For Fears. Singer-songwriter, Gary Jules, rerecorded the song for the movie,<i>Donnie Darko</i>. Jules&#x2019; version of the song was also used dozens of times as background music for the classic soap opera, <i>General Hospital</i>, as well as a prime time, hospital based show, <i>Private Practice</i>, a spin off of <i>Grey&#x2019;s Anatomy</i>. The song was a natural choice for Ben. Although the lyrics weren&#x2019;t featured in the video, Ben knew them by heart. They almost perfectly choreographed his brush with heaven.</p><p><i>I find it kind of funny . . . . </i></p><p><i>I find it kind of sad . . . . </i></p><p><i>The dreams in which I&#x2019;m dying . . . .</i></p><p><i>Are the best I&#x2019;ve ever had . . . .4</i></p><p>No doubt, a reference to his vision on the floor at school,Ben began to show the note-cards in the order he had written them, holding up each card for just a few seconds, barely long enough for his viewers to read the message, before moving on to the next card. He said not a word, but told his story through the handwritten words on the cards, his demeanor, and his countenance.</p><p>Ben&#x2019;s facial features matched the message on the cards. When the card presented a serious message describing his condition of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Ben&#x2019;s countenance was commensurately serious. But when he told of positive, happy experiences, such as the bright light he had experienced when he was four, or the &#x201c;vision&#x201d; in which Kid Cudi joined him in the bright white, waiting room of heaven, he displayed a hint of a smile that let the viewer know that this was a good moment in Ben&#x2019;s life. Occasionally, his eyes glanced to his upper right, as though searching for something, but he made no reference to whatever he saw there.</p><p>When he described receiving a pacemaker, Ben stood up momentarily, and pulled back the neck of his t-shirt, revealing the large reddish scar on his chest. Other than that, he remained seated throughout both sections of the video, staying especially close to the camera on his computer.</p><p>He picked up the story on part two of the video, beginning with his collapse in school on December 6th, just a few weeks earlier. He wasn&#x2019;t obsessed so much with artistic excellence or form on this video. It was obvious that Ben was more concerned about the message than he was the medium. On one of the cards, he had blacked out a mistake rather than creating a new card. Near the end of part 2, Chica&#x2019;s wagging tail could be clearly seen swishing into the camera shot over Ben&#x2019;s right shoulder. Ben didn&#x2019;t seem to mind.</p><p>As Ben came to the conclusion of his story, he slowed the pace of the cards, holding each one slightly longer. After describing his experience in &#x201c;heaven&#x2019;s waiting room,&#x201d; Ben added on one of the last cards the poignant statement, &#x201c;I wish I NEVER woke up.&#x201d;</p><p>Then before the viewer even had time to grapple with the meaning of that statement, Ben asked a question on the next to last card&#x2014;a question that would profoundly impact the heart of nearly every person who would watch the video. On the next to last card, Ben asked, &#x201c;Do you believe in Angels or God?&#x201d;<br>Holding one more card, Ben added the important message he wanted to share with his friends.</p><p>The final card read simply: &#x201c;I Do.&#x201d;</p><p>Ben didn&#x2019;t upload the video to his usual channel location, &#x201c;BreedloveTV.&#x201d; Instead, Ben decided to upload the video to his newest YouTube channel, &#x201c;TotalRandomness512,&#x201d; a play on Austin&#x2019;s telephone area code. He set up no advertising or any means to gain revenue from this channel. It was a gift.</p><p>Looking into the computer screen, Ben gave the video one last look, and pressed &#x201c;upload.&#x201d; The two-part YouTube videos simply titled, &#x201c;This is My Story,&#x201d; now belonged to the world.</p></p><h2>Applique Outside the Lines with Piece O&#39;Cake Designs: No Rules-No Ruler</h2><p>Put down your ruler and create beautiful, freeform quilts with Piece O&#39; Cake&#39;s new improvisational applique and piecing techniques.</p><p>Becky Goldsmith and Linda Jenkins first met at the Green Country Quilters Guild in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where they both held up their hands and volunteered for jobs at their very first guild meetings.

He sees law not as a system of rules to be obeyed and ethical ideals to be respected, but as a weapon to be used against his adversaries or a hurdle to be sidestepped when it gets in his way. He has weaponized the justice system throughout his career, and he has continued to use these backhanded tactics as <i>Plaintiff in Chief</i>.</p><p>In this book, distinguished New York attorney James D. Zirin presents Trump's lengthy litigation history as an indication of his character and morality, and his findings are chilling: if you partner with Donald Trump, you will probably wind up litigating with him. If you enroll in his university or buy one of his apartments, chances are you will want your money back. If you are a woman and you get too close to him, you may need to watch your back. If you try to sue him, he's likely to defame you. If you make a deal with him, you had better get it in writing. If you are a lawyer, an architect, or even his dentist, you'd better get paid up front.

I am afraid of the future, alone. I am tormented by my incapacity to meet what is expected of me. It would be easier just to be dead&#34;. What is the meaning of such emotions? What is emotion itself? What is really happening in therapy when people &#34;express their emotions&#34;? As James Hillman writes in his new preface to this sweeping study, he intends nothing less than &#34;to vitalize a standard topic of academic psychology by making the theory of emotion as crucial as is emotion itself in our lives&#34;. The central part of the book offers an informative and readable survey of a range of theories of emotion. Although Hillman focuses on the twentieth century, he moves with ease from Greek thought to early Christianity to nineteenth-century German physiology. Hillman&#39;s &#34;phenomenology of theories&#34; uncovers the intellectual heritage that underlies the concepts used by therapists today. Whenever we conceive of emotion in terms of equilibrium and disturbance, tension and release, or conflict and resolution, we are taking part in complex traditions which for the most part remain unspoken or misunderstood. Hillman&#39;s work challenges us to rethink our concepts and thereby to re-experience emotional phenomena. Hillman reunites the insights he has discovered into an integrated understanding of emotion. Drawing fruitfully on Aristotle and Jung, he describes emotion as a bodily condition, as a process that is intrinsically directed toward a beneficial transformation, and as the result of symbolic stimulus. Eschewing all reductionism, Hillman creates a powerful approach to a problem that ultimately &#34;remains perennial and its solution ineffable&#34;. This learned studyfrom a versatile psychologist and analyst contributes to today&#39;s renewed interest in the history of the body. Furthermore, his understanding of emotions in terms of epiphany makes a stimulating contribution to phenomenology. This book is equally thought-provoking for the therapist, the philosopher, the intellectual historian, and the general reader.<b>James Hillman</b> is a psychologist, scholar, international lecturer, pioneer psychologist, and the author of more than twenty books, including <i>The Soul's Code</i>, <i>Re-Visioning Psychology,</i><i>Healing Fiction</i>, <i>The Dream and the Underworld</i>, <i>Inter Views</i>, and<i> Suicide and the Soul.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; A Jungian analyst and originator of post-Jungian "archetypal psychology, " he has held teaching positions at Yale University, the University of Chicago, Syracuse University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Dallas, where he cofounded the Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture.

Liz is bold and brave, and always knows the right thing to say, especially to Sally, the resident mean girl. Liz even helps Marlee overcome her greatest fear - speaking, which Marlee never does outside her family. <br><br> But then Liz is gone, replaced by the rumor that she was a Negro girl passing as white. But Marlee decides that doesn't matter. Liz is her best friend. And to stay friends, Marlee and Liz are willing to take on integration and the dangers their friendship could bring to both their families.</p><p>Kristin Levine, the author of ALA Best Book for Young Adults <i>The Best Bad Luck I Ever Had</i>, lives in Alexandria, Virginia.In Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1958, as politicians rage for and against the struggle to integrate schools, Marlee, 13, is a math whiz but she has a personal problem with mutism&#x2014;she&#x2019;s terrified to say things aloud in public. Then she makes friends&#x2014;and more importantly, talks&#x2014;with Lizzie, the new girl in her middle school, who encourages Marlee to even do an oral presentation in class together. Then one day Lizzie is thrown out of school. It turns out that she is a light-skinned black passing for white, and the locals refuse to follow the federal integration order. (Several kids and rabid adults use the n-word.) Marlee and Lizzie meet secretly, until it becomes too dangerous, with threatening phone calls and the KKK always around. Marlee discovers dynamite in a classmate&#x2019;s car, and yet still the police do nothing. Marlee&#x2019;s first-person narrative brings home the standoffs with classmates, family, and officials, but what is most moving is that while most do not change, some do.

North Vietnam and Iran have done it. Now, North Korea may try to consolidate the South with such a strategy. Scores of tiny Western outposts could do this too. After a short threat assessment, <i>Dragon Days</i> describes what a single U.S. rifle squad must do to safely accomplish such a mission in Asia. It will need the following Unconventional Warfare (UW) skills: (1) some police procedure; (2) obscurely defending; (3) finding an enemy weakness; (4) making a secret approach; (5) disguising the attack; (6) precluding a counterstroke; (7) rural E&amp;E; (8) <b>enhancing rural terrain</b> (9) urban E&amp;E; and (10) <b>enhancing urban terrain</b>. Because of Asia's bottom-up culture, the little picture is where such an ability originates. This heavily illustrated book contains more small-unit perspective than any U.S. govt. publication. <b>In fact, it may still constitute America's only UW tactical-technique manual</b>.</p><p>Through an inverted military career, Poole has discovered a few things that more promotable people miss. After spending 2 out of his first 4 years as a combat commander, he did his last 7 as an enlisted tactics instructor. That allowed him to see why U.S troops have so much trouble quelling insurgency, and with short-range combat in general. The techniques in their tactics manuals are quite simply outmoded--so unlikely to surprise a &#34;woods-wise&#34; defender as to be &#34;premachinegun&#34; in format. This little oversight on the part of their commanders and how to correct it has formed the framework of Poole&#39;s work. Since retirement from the U.S. Marine Corps in 1993, he has has traveled extensively in both Communist and Islamist worlds and written 12 other tactics and intel. manual supplements. He has also conducted multiday training sessions for 41 U.S. battalions, 9 military schools, and 7 special-operations units from all 4 service branches. As most U.S. intelligence personnel know too little about the Eastern thought process and evolution of squad tactics, these supplements provide currently deployed GIs with a rare glimpse into their opponent&#39;s intentions. Poole has been stationed twice each in South Vietnam and Okinawa. He has further visited Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, both Koreas, Mainland China (twice), Hong Kong, Macao, North Vietnam, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Tibet, Nepal, Bangladesh, India (5 times), Pakistan (twice), Russia, Turkey, and Iran. Between early tours in the Marine Corps, he worked for 2 years as a criminal investigator in Chicago for the Illinois Bureau of Investigation. While at the IBI, he studied Tae Kwon Do."Marines, Soldiers, and other personnel who directly face 4GW threats will benefit from reading 'Dragon Days.'

I had a pair of imaginary bill collectors, so no matter which way I turned, there was somebody to remind me I needed money. That's how I ended up on a train at four o'clock in the morning with my nephew and a hundred pounds of weed. <br> We were hours behind schedule, but the westbound Southwest Chief was running on time. When the two trains met each other, they rattled back and forth, and the air that leaked in through the vents smelled like diesel and burning brakes. I could see into the other train's windows, where a few people were still awake. Usually, it made me feel lonely, seeing those people so close, but separated from me. <br> This time felt different. Having Marcus' head resting in my lap reminded me I wasn't alone. He was small like his mother and dark-haired like his father, but when he was asleep, he was like me. Always running hot and trying to burrow his way into things. After hours of him sleeping on me, my hip hurt so much I kept hoping he would wake up, but he slept through the railroad crossing bells in every small town we went through. When he did wake up, rolling over and grinding his forehead into me, I didn't make him move, though. I smoothed his hair down and said, "Shh, it's okay. I'm here. Go back to sleep."<br> The trip to Trinidad had never been a big deal to me, but then I'd never had to take Marcus with me. I didn't have a choice, when LaReigne didn't come home, and twenty-four hours later, I was still waiting to hear from her. Waiting but dreading it, too, because there was no way I could keep lying to her. I would have to tell her about the weed and she would have to get over it. She could be as mad as she wanted, but that wasn't going to pay the rent, and maybe it was time she knew where the extra cash came from. Sometimes she spent money like it magically appeared in our bank account. Like the gas money she burned up driving to El Dorado to volunteer at the prison.<br> Back before I started doing the Colorado run, LaReigne used to call Asher my <i>boyfriend</i>, I guess because that was the only way me having sex with him made sense to her. She didn't understand it was just about the money. My hospital bills, the rent, the groceries, Mom's prescriptions, LaReigne's tuition, and whatever thing Marcus needed, because kids are money pits. <br> In my experience, you could fuck for money, or wait tables for money, or sit in an insurance office forty hours a week like LaReigne did. However you get it, you need it, because money always decides whether things get better or worse. They never stay the same.<br> I was in too much pain to sleep, so I practiced in my head how I would explain all of that to LaReigne. <br> The thing that bothered me was that she didn't always come home on her volunteer nights, but she always texted. She always had an excuse. One time, exactly one time, she had completely flaked out on us. It was right after she'd filed for divorce, so Marcus had only been three. We'd been in our apartment for a month and we didn't know where the next month's rent was coming from. We were living on potatoes and canned stuff from the food bank. One Thursday, LaReigne had gone out for a job interview and hadn't come home. I'd spent the whole weekend trying to find her, and gotten fired from my job for not showing up. LaReigne had finally come home on Sunday night and we had a knock down drag out fight. She never told me where she'd been, but she'd promised she would never do that again. And she hadn't.<br> Except where was she? If she'd lost her phone, she would have replaced it by now, so I couldn't keep pretending that's why she wasn't answering. For the first time, I let myself think about other reasons. Maybe she was dead. A car wreck. Some asshole with a gun who got her office and the Planned Parenthood clinic down the street confused. Her ex-husband was in jail in Texas or I would've added him to the possible ways LaReigne could die. He'd threatened her enough times. Looking at one of the last texts I'd sent her, I wished I could take it back. <i>If you're not dead, I'm going to kill you. </i>What if I'd jinxed her?<br> A new text popped up, but it was only from Asher's lackey, Toby: <i>Why is the train so late?</i> <br> <i>Engine problems</i><br> <i>Ok well if there r cops at Newton ur on ur own</i><br> <i>WTF are you talking about? Why would there be cops? </i>I said.<br> The little dots flashed as Toby typed. When the answer came, I would have fallen down if I hadn't been sitting down: <i>This deal with your sister. Asher gonna murder u if the cops get his shit</i><br> Panic washed over me and my hands shook so hard I could barely type.<i> What are you talking about the shit with my sister???</i><br> <i>The thing out at the prison. </i><br> <i>What thing at the prison???</i><br> Toby didn't answer.<br> I opened my internet app to look at the <i>Wichita Eagle's</i> website. While I waited for it to load, I couldn't tell if it was the train rocking back and forth or my stomach. <br> <i>MANHUNT FOR ESCAPED INMATES</i> was the top headline. Underneath that were grainy pictures of two guys in orange prison jumpsuits. <br> The smaller headline was <i>TWO GUARDS KILLED IN RIOT</i>, with pictures of the guards in their uniforms. Below that: <i>Night of rioting ends with three inmates injured and two volunteers taken hostage</i>. LaReigne was so unimportant, they mentioned her last. I didn't recognize the picture they used for her, so it was probably from her volunteer badge at the prison. She managed to look glamorous even in a mugshot style picture. Her hair in blond waves and her eyebrows drawn on perfectly. The other volunteer was a woman, too. Chubby and maybe fifty with short brown hair. Was it Molly, who LaReigne had stayed with a couple times when she had a migraine and didn't want to drive home?<br> I tried to find out more, but all the news sites had the same information. Rioting, low staffing, overcrowding, dead guards, escape, hostages. I was re-reading it over and over, when the train pulled into Newton. <br> I was the last person off the train, practically carrying Marcus while the conductor tossed my suitcases out on the sidewalk. Marcus flopped down on the ground next to the bags, cried for about two minutes, and then fell asleep. <br> I almost cried, too, but I held it together while everybody was meeting up with their families and finding their rides. The whole time, Toby was standing in the shadows, watching me. Maybe he thought he was keeping a low profile, but he looked like a creeper. <br> "Do you want this shit or not?" I said, after the train pulled away. <br> "Keep your voice down." <br> "There aren't any cops." I raised my voice, same as always, because being mad was easier than being scared. Toby came over and started towing my suitcases toward where he'd parked his car next to mine. After sitting for twelve hours, my hip felt like it was full of gravel, but I picked Marcus up and limped after Toby.<br> Usually Toby unloaded the suitcases into his trunk and gave them back to me, but when I got to his car, he was tossing them into the back seat. Those suitcases were serious business: matching, locking, hard-sided, polycarbonate, all-terrain wheels. The only place I'd ever taken them was Trinidad, Colorado, and the only thing I'd ever packed in them was Asher's weed. They'd cost me serious money, too, but right then didn't seem like a safe time to argue about them, so I set Marcus down and unlocked my car.<br> "Why the hell did you bring the kid anyway?" Toby said.<br> "Because I had to. Asher said if I didn't make the run tonight, he'd have you fuck me up."<br> Toby laughed and said, "You're already fucked up. What kinda person brings their kid on a run?"<br> "He's my nephew and my sister didn't come home last night, which <i>you already know</i>. There was nobody else to watch him. "<br> "Shit, for real? This is LaReigne's kid?" Toby looked at Marcus, who was asleep on his feet, leaning up against me. "So that's some crazy shit, huh? What do you think is--<br> "Shut up, you asshole!"<br> Even though Marcus was right there Toby reached out and grabbed me by the neck. He pushed me back against my car, digging his thumb into my throat. <br> "You need to learn some fucking manners, Zee."<br> "Please," I said, which wasn't what I felt at all. "Don't say anything in front of him."<br> When Toby let go of me, I opened the door and lifted Marcus into his car seat. After I shut the door, I turned back to Toby with my arms crossed, so he wouldn't see me shivering. There was a reason Toby couldn't do the run to Colorado himself. He looked exactly like what he was: a drug-dealing thug with a neck tattoo and a squirrely eye. He also happened to be one of the scariest people I knew. Him and Asher. Any time I got tempted by those blocks of cash, that was all I had to think about. Two hundred grand would pay off all my debts--hell, the debts of everybody I knew--but it would also get me killed.<br> "Jesus," Toby said. "I was gonna offer to make things easier for you with Asher. Smooth things over."<br> I knew what he had in mind for payment for a favor like that, and I really wanted to be done paying for things with sex. I hoped I was never going to be that desperate again.<br> "Anyway, doesn't matter now. Asher told me to tell you you're cut off. You don't call him. You don't text him. He'll call you after this shit quiets down."<br> I probably should have got in the car and left, but I had bills to pay.<br> "My money?" I said.<br> Toby snorted, but he reached into his back pocket and took out an envelope. He held onto it for a couple seconds after I reached for it, but he finally let it go. I stuffed the money into my pocket and walked around to the driver's side of my car. When I opened the door, Toby was still watching me.<br> "Tell Asher he owes me for those suitcases," I said. Those weren't cheap." <br><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Chapter 2 -- Zee<br> &nbsp;<br> When we were in grade school, LaReigne and I walked to and from school, separated by about ten feet or so, because she was too cool to walk with a <i>baby</i>. One day--I was in third grade and LaReigne was in sixth--when we got to our block, there were half a dozen cop cars parked in front of our house. I remember crying, even before I knew what had happened. I don't know when I learned to be afraid of the police, but I was. We all were. That day, LaReigne took my hand, and we walked down the street to our house together. Mom stood on the front porch, screaming and sobbing, with a cop on either side of her. Dad was locked in the back seat of a police car, with his head turned so he wouldn't have to look at his wife or his daughters. <br> Now, driving past our apartment building and seeing a police car and a police van parked outside, I felt eight years old again. Afraid and angry, but not ignorant or innocent anymore. I didn't dare stop. I had five ounces of weed in my backpack and a bunch of drops and edibles. Probably the smart thing to do was ditch the weed, but I couldn't afford to. I needed the money, and it was the only thing that really worked for my pain that didn't require a prescription.<br> I kept driving.<br> "You missed our turn," Marcus said. Five years old and he was already a backseat driver. <br> "We're not going home yet." I pulled up to the light at Central, white-knuckling the steering wheel to keep myself focused. In my side view mirror, I could still see the cop car parked in front of our apartment. <br> "Where are we going?" he said.<br> "Grandma's house." <br> I should have gone somewhere else. Anywhere else. A motel. A park. A fucking church. Even going to Marcus' other grandparents would have been a better terrible choice, if I was going to make a terrible choice. My mother's house was on a cul-de-sac that dead ended where they had widened Kellogg into a six-lane highway, so when I turned down the street, I was already stuck. There were three news vans, plus half a dozen other cars. Once again my family was newsworthy. <br> Reporters didn't scare me the way cops did, so I pulled up at the end of the line of cars and parked. I got Marcus out of the car and led him across the neighbors' yards, but as soon as we reached the weedy edge of Mom's yard, the reporters saw us. Holding Marcus' hand tighter, I walked faster, keeping my eyes focused on Mom's front porch, which was piled up with old furniture and lawn tools.<br> "Are you a member of the Trego family?" said the first reporter that reached us.<br> "Do you know the family?" said another one.<br> A TV cameraman cut me off at the sidewalk, while more reporters shouted, "Do you know LaReigne Trego-Gill?" <br> Marcus started to cry, and then his hand slipped out of mine. My heart lurched and I turned around, thinking it would be a reporter or a cop or ... I didn't know who might grab Marcus. <br> Standing there, next to Marcus, was Gentry. Where had he come from? Had he followed me there? Of course, he followed me everywhere. Before I could think of what to say, Gentry picked Marcus up. What I would have done if my hip hadn't been hurting so much. Then Gentry reached past me and used his arm as a barrier between me and the cameraman who was nearly in my face.<br> "Let the lady pass!" Gentry bellowed. The cameraman backed up. <br> I ran the last ten feet to the porch, with Gentry behind me carrying Marcus. The screen door was only attached at one hinge, so you had to be really careful with it, and I wasn't. I was so freaked out, I jerked it open, and the glass panel on the top rattled into the bottom and almost fell out. I managed to shove the whole thing out of the way, but the front door was locked. I pulled my keys out of my pocket and got the deadbolt turned. When I pushed, the door opened, but only a few inches. For a second, I thought, <i>Mom has finally managed to block both doors</i>. <i>She's going to die trapped in there.</i><br> "Has the family heard anything from LaReigne? Do you have any news? Has there been a ransom demand? Are the police negotiating?" Reporters were shouting behind me, Marcus was sobbing, and I could hear Gentry breathing hard.<br> "Push," I said to Gentry, and I stepped as far off to the side as I could. Still holding Marcus, he put his free hand on the frame and leaned his whole body into the door. There was a thump and a crash inside, and the door lurched open wide enough for us to squeeze through. <br> Inside, there was no room for us to do anything but stand packed together. Gentry slammed the door closed and set Marcus down on top of a half-collapsed stack of newspapers. I hugged Marcus tight, feeling his whole body quivering. I wondered if he understood why those strangers were shouting his mother's name. <br> "It's okay, buddy. I got you," I said. With this sick lurch, I realized that I was LaReigne now. Not just for Marcus, but for me. After Dad went to prison, right up until she left for college, LaReigne had been the adult in our family. After that I had to be my own adult, but now I would have to be one for Marcus, too. <br> "Zhorzha? Is that you, Zhorzha?" Mom yelled from the family room. <br> "Yeah, it's me. I have Marcus with me." <br> "What was that crash? What did you knock over?"<br> "I don't know. Whatever was behind the door. I almost couldn't get it open."</p><h2>How to Read Hitler</h2><p><p><strong>Intent upon letting the reader discover the central concepts of important thinkers, the <em>How to Read</em> series provides a context and an explanation that will facilitate and enrich your understanding of texts vital to our world today.</strong></p> Approaching the writing of major intellectuals, artists, and philosophers need no longer be daunting. <em>How to Read</em> is a new sort of introduction--a personal master class in reading--that brings you face to face with the work of some of the most influential and challenging writers in history.

When I arrived in August of 1978, he was not a character so much as a rhythmic possibility, an embryonic creature of my imagination, which I felt as a series of metrical beats that quickened and slowed with my steps as I navigated the streets of the city. I think I was hoping to discover myself in him, to prove that he and I were worthy of whatever story came our way. I wasn&#x2019;t looking for happiness or comfort in New York City. I was looking for adventure, and I knew the adventurer must suffer before he arrives home after countless trials on land and sea or is finally snuffed out by the gods. I didn&#x2019;t know then what I know now: As I wrote, I was also being written. The book had been started long before I left the plains. Multiple drafts of a mystery had already been inscribed in my brain, but that didn&#x2019;t mean I knew how it would turn out. My unformed hero and I were headed for a place that was little more than a gleaming fiction: the future.<br> <br>I had given myself exactly twelve months to write the novel. If at the end of the following summer, my hero was stillborn or died in infancy or turned out to be such a dullard that his life deserved no comment, in other words, if he was not a hero after all, I would leave him and his novel behind me and throw myself into the study of my dead (or failed) boy&#x2019;s ancestors, the denizens of the volumes that fill the phantom cities we call libraries. I had accepted a fellowship in comparative literature at Columbia University and, when I asked if I could defer my admission until the following year, the invisible authorities had sent me a long-winded letter agreeing to my request.<br> <br>A dark room with a kitchenette, an even darker bedroom, a tiny black-and-white-tiled bathroom, and a closet with a bulging plaster ceiling at 309 West 109th Street cost me two hundred and ten dollars a month. It was a grim apartment in a scraped, chipped, battered building, and had I been just a little different, a bit more worldly or a touch less well read, its sour green paint and its views of two dirty brick walls in the stinking summer heat would have wilted me and my ambitions, but the degree of difference that was required, however infinitesimal, did not exist at the time. Ugly was beautiful. I decorated the rented rooms with the charmed sentences and paragraphs I lifted at will from the many volumes I kept in my head.<br> <br>He had filled his imagination with everything that he had read, with enchantments, knightly encounters, battles, challenges, wounds, with tales of love and its torments, and all sorts of impossible things, and as a result had come to believe that all these fictitious happenings were true; they were more real to him than anything else in the world.<br> <br>My first moments in my first apartment have a radiant quality in memory that have nothing to do with sunlight. They are illuminated by an idea. Security deposit down, first month&#x2019;s rent paid, door closed on my squat, grinning super, Mr. Rosales, sweat soaking the underarms of my T-shirt, I hopped about on the floorboards in what I believed to be a jig and threw out my arms in triumph.<br> <br>I was twenty-three years old with a BA in philosophy and English from St. Magnus College (a small liberal arts institution in Minnesota founded by Norwegian immigrants); five thousand dollars in the bank, a wad of dough I had saved while I worked as a bartender in my hometown of Webster for a year after graduation and bunked at home for free; a Smith Corona typewriter, a tool kit, cooking equipment donated by my mother, and six boxes of books. I built a desk with two-by-fours and a plywood sheet. I bought two plates, two cups, two glasses, two forks, two knives, and two spoons in anticipation of the future lover (or series of lovers) with whom, after a night of delirious banging, I planned to eat a breakfast of toast and eggs, which, because I had no table and no chairs, would be consumed on the floor.<br> <br>I remember the door closing on Mr. Rosales, and I remember my jubilation. I remember the two rooms of the old apartment, and I can walk from one to the other in my mind. I can still see the space, but if I am honest, I cannot describe the precise configurations of the cracks in the bedroom ceiling, the lumpy lines and delicate flowerings I know were there because I studied them, nor am I absolutely certain about the dimensions of the refrigerator, for example, which I believe to have been smallish. I&#x2019;m quite sure it was white and it may have been round at its corners, not square. The more I focus on remembering, the more details I am likely to provide, but those particulars may well be invented. And so, I will not expound on the appearance, for example, of the potatoes that lay on the plates in front of me thirty-eight years ago. I will not tell you whether they were pale and boiled or saut�ed lightly or au gratin or fried because I do not remember them. If you are one of those readers who relishes memoirs filled with impossibly specific memories, I have this to say: those authors who claim perfect recall of their hash browns decades later are not to be trusted.<br> <br>And so, I arrive in the city I have dreamed about since I was eight years old but do not know from Adam (as a child, I thought the expression was &#x201c;from atom&#x201d; and that it bore some relation to the terrifying physics of the bomb).<br> <br>And so, I arrive in the city I have seen in films and have read about in books, which is New York City but also other cities, Paris and London and St. Petersburg, the city of the hero&#x2019;s fortunes and misfortunes, a real city that is also an imaginary city.<br> <br>I remember the eerie illumination that came through the broken blinds the first night I slept in apartment 2B on August 25. I told myself I needed a new shade or it would never be truly dark in the room. The hot air didn&#x2019;t move. My sweat turned the sheets damp, and my dreams were harsh and vivid, but by the time I had made coffee and taken the cup back to my foam mattress to drink it the following morning, I had forgotten what I dreamt. During my first week in New York, I wrote in the mornings and traveled on the subway in the afternoons. I had no destination in mind, but I know that as the train rumbled through the bowels of the city, my heart beat more quickly, and my newfound freedom seemed nearly impossible. A token cost fifty cents, and as long as I didn&#x2019;t take an exit and climb the stairs, I could change from one train to another without paying another fare. I chugged uptown and downtown on the IRT, and flew express on the A, and I crossed from the West Side to the East on the Shuttle and investigated the curious route of the L, and when the F rose up into daylight at Smith and Ninth Street and I had a sudden view of steaming Brooklyn with its jazz of jutting cement blocks, warehouses, and billboards, I found myself smiling out the window. As I sat or stood in one of the cars, jostled and jolted by its stops and starts, I paid homage to the ubiquitous graffiti, not for its beauty but for its insurrectionist spirit, one I hoped to imbibe and emulate for my own artistic purposes. I rejoiced in the screeching trains and in the voice of the man whose announcements turned to an unintelligible but sonorous scratch over the loudspeaker. I celebrated the press of the crowd as I was pushed out the door in a collective swell of movement, and I recited Whitman&#x2019;s lines &#x201c;myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated, yet part of the scheme.&#x201d; I wanted to be part of the scheme. I wanted to be everyone. I listened to all the languages spoken, some of them recognizable&#x2014;Spanish, Mandarin, German, Russian, Polish, French, Portuguese&#x2014;and some that I had never heard before. I reveled in the varieties of skin color near me, having been sated in Webster, Minnesota, by enough Lutheran pallor and its inflamed shades of pink to red to burnt farmer brown to last me a lifetime.<br> <br>I studied the bums and panhandlers and bag ladies at various stages of descent into the indignities of the street. Years before my arrival in New York City, the powers-that-were-at-the-time had opened the doors of psychiatric wards and released their patients into a dubious freedom. Mad people skulked on the platforms, picking at their sores. Some shouted verses. Some sang or whined or preached about Jesus coming or Jehovah&#x2019;s wrath, and some sat silently in black corners, reduced to husks of despair. I inhaled the stench of their unwashed bodies, an odor wholly new to me, and held my breath.<br> <br>The rhyme and reason of Manhattan&#x2019;s streets would have to wait. How one neighborhood related to another could be traced on the map I carried around with me, but it still had no carnal logic. When I leapt up the steps into the sun and the crowds, and my shoes hit the baked asphalt and melting tar, and I heard through the talk and traffic and general roar the cacophony of music from boom boxes hoisted on shoulders or swinging at thighs like suitcases, my skin bristled, my head felt light, and I prepared for the coming sensual assault. I remember my first walk down pushy, pungent Canal Street, the bronzed ducks that hung by their feet through greasy glass, the tubs of shining whole fishes, the baskets and cardboard boxes laden with grains and vegetables, and the fruits I would only later learn to name: star fruit, mangosteen, breadfruit, and longan.<br> <br>There were the squalid pleasures of walks through Times Square&#x2014;the signs that lured patrons with X and XX and XXX and burlesque, also spelled burlesk and bur_esk (due to fallen l), peep shows and the Paradise Playhouse and Filthy&#x2019;s and Circus Circus with live girls onstage for just a quarter and &#x201c;$10 dollars complete,&#x201d; and the silhouettes of naked women with jutting breasts and long legs above the marquees, and views of pizza parlors and game rooms and grim little laundry shops with brown paper packages tied with string piled high and the litter that leapt and twirled when the wind blew and three-card monte cheats who set up on the sidewalk to scam the suckers and the men with their shirtsleeves rolled to their elbows in the hot air who paused on the sidewalk, held captive for a moment by the promise of jiggling flesh and speedy relief, before they either walked inside to get some satisfaction or turned left or right and went on their way.<br> <br>I trekked to Greenwich Village for its Bohemian mythology in search of Dada&#x2019;s brilliant company. I was looking for Djuna Barnes and Marcel Duchamp, for Berenice Abbott, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Claude McKay, for Emmanuel Radnitzky, alias Man Ray. I was looking for William Carlos Williams and Jane Heap, for Francis Picabia and Arthur Craven, and the astounding character who had popped up in my Dada research, a woman I had chased to the archives of the University of Maryland, where for three days I had laboriously copied out in pencil her mostly unpublished poems: the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, n�e Elsa Hildegard Pl�tz, artist as proto-punk, fuck-you riot, who struck poses with birdcages on her head and headlights at her hips and wrote poems like howls or burps that came from deep in the diaphragm.<br> <br>&#x201c;No one asks for these papers,&#x201d; the archivist told me before she hauled out the boxes. I&#x2019;m No One then, I thought. The Baroness&#x2019;s papers arrived in Maryland in 1970 because Djuna Barnes, author of the intoxicating novel Nightwood, had saved her dead friend&#x2019;s letters and manuscripts and drawings and stored them in her New York apartment. When the university acquired the Barnes papers, the Baroness came along for the ride. Hour after hour, I sat with Elsa&#x2019;s yellowing papers, lined and unlined, studying one draft after another of a single poem until I became confused and my eyes hurt. After the day was over, I sat on my bed in my room at the Holiday Inn to read over what I had recorded and to feel the percussive jolts and jerks of the Baroness rock my body. She lived in the pages I took with me to New York, but there was no trace of her downtown. She wasn&#x2019;t even a ghost. There was nothing left of her in the narrow, off-kilter byways of the Village.<br> <br>Christopher Street was vibrant then, an open-air theater I liked to walk down incognito and peek in windows at erotic paraphernalia and costumes of a sort I had vaguely known existed but had never seen, and I wondered what my old friend Pastor Weeks would have thought of it all and what he might have said if he had been walking beside me, and I answered in the words he would have chosen: &#x201c;We are all sisters and brothers in the Lord.&#x201d; I admired the proud couples that resembled twins, lean and trim in matching blue jeans and fitted T-shirts and perfect posture with a little sway in their hips and maybe a dog on a leash between them as they strolled to show off their perfect beauty, and I liked the tall girls in plumes and heels, and I tried not to stare at the men I silently referred to as &#x201c;leather threats,&#x201d; the big muscle boys in black regalia with silver studs and spikes and intense expressions that made me look down at the sidewalk.<br> <br>I loitered in bookstores, in the Coliseum and Gotham Book Mart and Books and Company and the Strand. In the Eighth Street Bookshop, I bought Some Trees by John Ashbery, and I read it on the train and then aloud in the apartment over and over again. And I discovered the National Bookstore on Astor Place, jammed with tantalizing scholarly books wrapped in plastic to prevent fingerly invasions from people like me, overseen by a tyrant with white hair who kept time with his tapping pencil and barked if you lingered too long over a volume, and I had to save my money, so I usually left empty-handed, but old man Salter, not so friendly himself, let me sit on the floor of his bookstore back in my own neighborhood just across the street from Columbia, and I would lean against a shelf and read until I knew I truly wanted this book or that one, mostly poets new to me, but before the year was over, I had bought the whole New York School and beyond, more Ashbery, as well as Kenneth Koch and Ron Padgett and James Schuyler and Barbara Guest and Frank O&#x2019;Hara, the latter killed by a dune buggy on Fire Island twelve years before I arrived. And I still remember Guest&#x2019;s words, the ones that prompted me to buy her book: &#x201c;Understanding the distance between characters.&#x201d; I am still trying to understand that.<br> <br>And when I wanted the city to stop, I bounded up the steps between the stone lions and passed through the doors of the New York Public Library and walked swiftly to the grand reading room, fit for kings, and I seated myself at one of the long wooden tables under the vast vaulted ceiling with a chandelier dangling high above my head, and I ordered a book as the silent daylight from the great windows fell upon me, and I read for hours and felt as if I had become a being of pure potential, a body transformed into an enchanted space of infinite expansion, and as I sat and read to the dull sound of pages turning and to coughs and sniffs and footsteps that echoed in the immense room and the occasional rude whisper, I found refuge in the cadences of whichever mind I was borrowing for the duration, immersed in sentences I couldn&#x2019;t have written or imagined and, even when the text was abstruse or gnarled or beyond me, and there were many of those, I persevered and took notes and understood that my mission was one of years, not months. If I could fill my head with the wisdom an...</p><h2>The Prada Plan 3:: Green-Eyed Monster</h2><p>Leah has been trying for years to get rid of her competition, and all her crazy scheming has finally paid off&#x2014;or so she thinks.

From magazine pages to gallery walls, from advertisements to photojournalism, <i>Color Rush</i> charts the history of color photography in the United States from the moment it became available as a mass medium to the moment when it no longer seemed an unusual choice for artists. The book begins with the 1907 unveiling of autochrome, the first commercially available color process, and continues up through the 1981 landmark survey show and book, <i>The New Color Photography</i>, which hailed the widespread acceptance of color photography in contemporary art. In the intervening years, color photography captured the popular imagination through its visibility in magazines like <i>Life</i> and <i>Vogue</i>, as well as through its accessibility in the marketplace thanks to companies like Kodak. Often in photo histories, color is presented as having arrived fully formed in the 1970s; this book reveals a deeper story and uncovers connections in both artistic and commercial practices. A comprehensive chronology and examples of significant moments and movements mark the increasing visibility of color photography. <i>Color Rush</i> brings together photographers and artists such as Ansel Adams, Harry Callahan, William Christenberry, William Eggleston, Walker Evans, Nan Goldin, Saul Leiter, Helen Levitt, Philip-Lorca diCorcia, L�szl� Moholy-Nagy, Irving Penn, Eliot Porter, Cindy Sherman, Stephen Shore, Laurie Simmons, Edward Steichen, Joel Sternfeld, Edward Weston and many others, and examines them in a fresh context paying particular attention to color photography's translation onto the printed page. In doing so, it traces a new history that more fully accounts for color's pervasive presence today.</p><p>Katherine A. Bussard is Peter C.

He is a unique combination of mystic and Hellenic rationalist.

"Of all the effrontery!"<br><br>"Said to you?" Spencer Merrifield, earl of Hardstaff, had the most endearing way of lifting one eyebrow so that it resembled a gray question mark. Sitting in his grand tester bed, his thin frame propped against pillows and bolsters, he was bathed in the early-evening light that streamed through the oriel window. "You spoke to him?"<br><br>"Yes. I&#x2014;at the safe hold." She cringed inwardly at the small lie and studied the pattern of lozenge shapes that tiled the floor. Spencer would object to her being present for the hanging. But the safe hold was run by godly folk whose goals matched Spencer's own.<br><br>"I see. Well, then. What did Oliver de Lacey say to you?"<br><br>She frowned and plopped down onto a stool by the bed, tucking her soft, kerseymere skirts between her knees. "I thought his name was Oliver Lackey."<br><br>"That is one of his names. In sooth he is Lord Oliver de Lacey, Baron Wimberleigh, son and heir to the earl of Lynley."<br><br>"He? A noble?" The man had been wearing a stained shirt and plain fustian jerkin over torn and ragged canions and hose. No shoes; those were always appropriated by prison wardens. He had looked as common as a mongrel dog&#x2014;until he had smiled at her.<br><br>Spencer watched her closely as if seeking to peer into her mind. She was familiar with the look. When she was very small, she used to liken Spencer to the Almighty Himself, with all the powers of His station.<br><br>"Betimes he goes about incognito," Spencer explained, "I suppose to spare his family from embarrassment. Now. What did the young lord say to you?"<br><br><em>Will you have my baby?</em><br><br>Lark's face burned scarlet at the memory. Her response had been a drop-jawed look of astonishment. Then, humiliated to the depths of her prayer-fed soul, she had flounced away, instructing him to hide in the cart until Dr. Snipes joined them and they reached the safe hold.<br><br>"I shall lie low," Oliver had said, "but I should be more content if you were lying beneath me."<br><br>Thank heavens Dr. Snipes had returned and spared her from having to respond.<br><br>Now she looked at Spencer and felt such a wave of horror and guilt that her hands trembled. She buried them deep in the folds of her skirts.<br><br>"I do not recall his precise words," she said, lying again. "But he had a most insolent manner."<br><br>"Perhaps his brush with death put him in a foul mood."<br><br>It was an unusually tolerant observation from a man of little tolerance. Lark blinked in surprise. She tried to will her flushed cheeks to cool. "He could use a lesson in manners."<br><br>"Be he rapscallion or man of honor, did he deserve to die?"<br><br>"No," she whispered, instantly contrite. She took Spencer's hand; his was cool and dry with age and infirmity. "Forgive me. I lack your generosity of spirit."<br><br>His fingers squeezed hers briefly. "A woman cannot be expected to comprehend the matters that move a man to courage."<br><br>She felt a sudden urge to snatch her hand away, then just as quickly buried the impulse. She owed all that she was to Spencer Merrifield. If from time to time his well-meaning comments grated, she should ignore them with good grace.<br><br>"And what lofty purpose do you have in mind for Oliver de Lacey?" she asked.<br><br>She could see the flame of the dying sun reflected in Spencer's cloudy gray eyes, which peered all the way through to her soul. Sometimes she feared his wisdom, for he seemed to know her better than she knew herself.<br><br>"Spencer?" She touched her stiff gray bodice, wondering if her partlet or coif had come askew.<br><br>"I've a purpose in mind for the lad. My dear," he said, "I am sick and getting sicker."<br><br>A lump of dread rose in her throat. "Then we shall seek a new physician, consult&#x2014;"<br><br>He waved her silent. "Death is part of the circle of life, Lark. It's all around us. I have no fear of the hereafter. But I must make provisions for you. The manor of Evensong is already yours, of course. I intend to leave you all my worldly goods, all my monies. You'll want for nothing."<br><br>She did take her hand away then and tucked it between her knees, seeking warmth as an unbearable chill swept over her. He spoke so matter-of-factly, when in truth his death would change her life irrevocably.<br><br>"You are nineteen," he observed. "Most women are mothers by the time they reach your age."<br><br>"I have no regrets," she said stoutly. "Truly, I&#x2014;"<br><br>"Hush. Listen, Lark. When I'm gone, you will be left alone. Worse than alone."<br><br>Worse? She caught her breath, then said, "Wynter."<br><br>"Aye. My son." The word was a curse on his lips. Wynter Merrifield was Spencer's son by his first wife, Do�a Elena de Dura. Many years ago, before Lark's birth, the marriage had crumbled beneath the weight of Do�a Elena's scorn for her English husband and her flagrant affairs with other, younger men. Like the Church of England and the Church of Rome, Spencer and Elena had been torn apart, the fissure created by infidelity and hatred.<br><br>And Wynter, now a strapping young lord of twenty-five, was the casualty.<br><br>When she had left Spencer, Do�a Elena had not told him she was expecting a child. While in sanctuary in Scotland, she had given birth and raised Wynter to be as bitter against his father as she was and as devoted to Queen Mary as Elena had been to Catherine of Aragon.<br><br>Two and a half years earlier Wynter had come back to Blackrose Priory to hover like a carrion bird over his father's wasting form. Each day Lark watched him furtively from her chamber window. As slim and darkly handsome as a young god, he rode the length and breadth of the estate, his black horse sweeping along the rich green water meadows by the river or racing up the terraced hills where sheep grazed.<br><br>The thought of Wynter made Lark fitful, and she stood and walked to the window. The sun was lowering over the wild Chiltern Hills in the distance, and shadows gathered in the river valley.<br><br>"By law," Spencer said wearily, "Wynter must inherit my estate. It is entailed to my sole male heir."<br><br>"Is he your heir?" she asked baldly, though she did not dare to turn and look at Spencer.<br><br>"A sticky matter," Spencer admitted. "I knew nothing of his existence when I put aside my first wife and had the marriage annulled. But as soon as I learned I had a son, I had him legitimized. How could I not? He did not ask to be born to a woman who would teach him to hate."<br><br>Lark heard the clink of glass as Spencer poured himself more of his medicine. "I should not have asked. Of course he is your son and heir." She shivered and continued to face the window, battered by a storm of bitter memories. "Your only one."<br><br>"You must help me stop him. Wynter wishes to exalt Queen Mary by reviving a religious house at Blackrose Priory. He'll turn this place into a hotbed of popish idolatry. The monks who lived here before the Dissolution were voluptuous sinners," Spencer went on. "I sweated blood into this estate. I need to know it will stay the same after I'm gone. And what will become of you?"<br><br>She rushed to the stool by the bed. "I try not to think about life without you. But when I do, I see myself continuing the work of the Samaritans. Dr. Snipes and his wife will look after me." It had occurred to her that she possessed some degree of cleverness, perhaps even enough to look after herself. She knew better than to point that out to Spencer.<br><br>He gestured at the chest at the foot of the bed. "Open that."<br><br>She did as he asked, using a key from the iron ring she wore tied to her waist. She found a stack of books and scrolled documents in the chest. "What is all this?"<br><br>"I'm going to disinherit Wynter," he said. She heard the pain in his voice, saw the flash of regret in his fading eyes.<br><br>"How can you?" She closed the lid and rested her elbows on top of the chest. "You do love your son."<br><br>"I cannot trust him. When I see him, I notice a hardness, a cruelty, that sits ill with me."<br><br>She thought of Wynter with his hair and eyes of jet, his lean swordsman's body, and his mouth that was harsh even when he smiled. He was a man of prodigious good looks and deep secrets. A dangerous combination, as she well knew.<br><br>"How will you do this?" she asked without turning around. "How will you deny Wynter his birthright?"<br><br>"I shall need your help, dear Lark."<br><br>She turned to him in surprise. "What can I do?"<br><br>"Find me a lawyer. I cannot trust anyone else."<br><br>"You would entrust this task to me?" she asked, shocked.<br><br>"There is no one else. I shall need you to find someone who is discreet, yet totally lacking in scruples."<br><br>"This is so unlike you&#x2014;"<br><br>"Just do it." A fit of coughing doubled him over, and she rushed to him, patting his back.<br><br>"I shall," she said in a soothing voice. "I shall find you the most unscrupulous knave in London."<br><br>Lark stood at the grand river entrance of the elegant half-timbered London residence. It was hard to believe Oliver de Lacey lived here, along the Strand, a stretch of riverbank where the great houses of the nobility stood shoulder to shoulder, their terraced gardens running down to the water's edge.<br><br>The door opened, and she found herself facing a plump, elderly woman with a hollowed horn thrust up against her ear. "Is Lord Oliver de Lacey at home?"<br><br>"Eh? He ain't lazy at home." The woman thumped her blackthorn cane on the floor. "Our dear Oliver can be a right hard worker when he's of a mind to be wanting something."<br><br>"Not lazy," Lark called, leaning toward the bell of the trumpet. "De Lacey. Oliver de Lacey."<br><br>The woman grimaced. "You needn't shout." She patted her well-worn apron. "Come near the fire, and tell old Nance your will."<br><br>Venturing inside a few more steps, Lark stood speechless. She felt as if she had entered a great clockwork. Everywhere&#x2014;at the hearth, the foot of the stairs, along the walls&#x2014;she saw huge toothed flywheels and gears, all connected with cables and chains.<br><br>Her heart skipped a beat. This was a chamber of torture! Perhaps the de Laceys were secret Catholics who&#x2014;<br><br>"You look as though you're scared of your own shadow." Nance waved her cane. "These be naught but harmless contraptions invented by Lord Oliver's sire. See here." She touched a crank at the foot of the wide staircase, and with a great grinding noise a platform slid upward.<br><br>In the next few minutes, Lark saw wonders beyond imagining&#x2014;a moving chair on runners to help the crippled old housekeeper up and down the stairs, an ingenious system to light the great wheeled fixture that hung from the hammer beam ceiling, a clock powered by heat from the embers in the hearth, a bellows worked by a remote system of pulleys.<br><br>Nance Harbutt, who proudly called herself the mistress of Wimberleigh House, assured Lark that such conveniences could be found throughout the residence. All were the brainchildren of Stephen de Lacey, the earl of Lynley.<br><br>"Come sit." Nance gestured at a strange couch that looked as if it sat upon sled runners.<br><br>Lark sat, and a cry of surprise burst from her. The couch glided back and forth like a swing in a gentle breeze.<br><br>Nance sat beside her, fussily arranging several layers of skirts. "His Lordship made this after marrying his second wife, when the babies started coming. He liked to sit with her and rock them to sleep."<br><br>The vision evoked by Nance's words made Lark feel warm and strange inside. A man holding a babe to his chest, a loving woman beside him...these things were alien to Lark, as alien as the huge dog lazing upon the rushes in front of the hearth. The long-coated animal had the shape of a parchment-thin greyhound, with much longer legs.<br><br>A windhound from Russia, Nance explained, called borzoyas in their native land. Lord Oliver bred them, and the handsomest male of each litter was named Pavlo.<br><br>Lark forced herself to pay close attention to Nance Harbutt, the oldest retainer of the de Lacey family. The housekeeper had a tendency to ramble and a great dislike for being interrupted, so Lark sat quietly by.<br><br>Randall, the groom who had accompanied her from Blackrose Priory, was waiting in the kitchen. By now he would have found the ale or hard cider and would be useless to her. This did not bother her in the least. She and Randall had an agreement. She made no comment on his tippling, and he made no comment on her activities for the Samaritans.<br><br>According to Nance, the sun rose and set on Lord Oliver. There was no doubt in the old woman's mind that he had hung not only the moon, but also the sun and each and every little silver star in the heavens.<br><br>"I wish to see him," Lark said when Nance paused to draw a breath.<br><br>"To be him?" Nance frowned.<br><br>"To see him," Lark repeated, speaking directly into the horn.<br><br>"Of course you do, dearie." Nance patted her arm. Then she did a curious thing; she smoothed back the hood of Lark's black traveling cloak and peered at her.<br><br>"Dear God above," Nance said loudly. She picked up her apron and fanned her face.<br><br>"Is something amiss?"<br><br>"Nay. For a moment you&#x2014;that look on your face put me in mind of Lord Stephen's second wife, the day he brought her home."<br><br>Lark recalled what Spencer had told her of Oliver's family. Lord Stephen de Lacey, a powerful and eccentric man, had married young. His first wife had perished giving birth to Oliver. The second was a woman of Russian descent, reputed to be a singular beauty. Though flattered by the comparison, Lark thought the elderly retainer's sight was as weak as her hearing.<br><br>"Now then," Nance said, her manner brisk, "when is the babe due?"<br><br>"The babe?" Lark regarded her stupidly.<br><br>"The babe, lass! The one Lord Oliver sowed in you. And God be praised that it's finally happened&#x2014;"<br><br>"Ma'am." Lark's ears took fire.<br><br>"Weren't for lack of trying on the part of the dear lordling. 'Course, 'twould be preferable to marry first, but Oliver has ever been the&#x2014;"<br><br>"Mistress Harbutt, please." Lark fairly shouted into the trumpet.<br><br>"Eh?" Nance flinched. "Heaven above, lass, I ain't so deaf as a stone."<br><br>"I'm sorry. You misunderstand. I have no..." She lacked the words to describe how appalled she felt at the very suggestion that she might be a ruined woman carrying a rogue's bastard. "Lord Oliver and I are not that well acquainted. I wish to speak to him on a matter. Is he at home?"<br><br></p><h2>The Power in Your Hands: Writing Nonfiction in High School, 2nd Edition: Teacher&#39;s Guide</h2><p>Take the guesswork and anxiety out of grading essays with the 2nd edition of this TEACHER&#39;S GUIDE!

She began her writing life with snappy one-liners, notably, &#34;I Hate Math!!!&#34; gouged into the top of her fifth-grade math homework. In a junior high English class, she read The Scarlet Letter but could not figure out what Hester&#39;s &#34;A&#34; stood for. This has given her empathy for students stumbling through school and trying to make sense of their writing and literature classes, and she loves finding ways to make difficult writing tasks and concepts accessible to students. Sharon homeschooled her children for 18 years and teaches high school composition, fiction writing, and literature to local homeschool students and in all-day workshops. She and her husband live near Indianapolis, Indiana, and have three grown children and two grandchildren.

Thoughtful, provocative, moving, and sometimes mirthful, the poems collected in <i>The Best American Erotic Poems</i> celebrate this exuberant sensuality. <br> <br> These poems range across the varied landscapes of love and sex and desire -- from the intimate parts of the body to the end of an affair, from passion to solitary self-pleasure. With candor and imagination, they capture the delights and torments of sex and sexuality, nudity, love, lust, and the secret life of fantasy. <br> <br> David Lehman, the distinguished editor of the celebrated <i>Best American Poetry</i> series, has culled a witty, titillating, and alluring collection that starts with Francis Scott Key, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, and Hart Crane, encompasses Frank O'Hara, Anne Sexton, John Updike, Charles Simic, Billy Collins, Kevin Young, and Sharon Olds, and concludes with the rising stars of a whole new generation of versifiers, including Sarah Manguso, Ravi Shankar, and Brenda Shaughnessy. <br> <br> In a section of the book that is sure to prompt discussion and further reading, the living poets write about their favorite works of erotic writing. <br> <br> This book will delight, surprise, and inspire.</p><p>David Lehman, the series editor of The Best American Poetry, is also the editor of the&nbsp;<i>Oxford Book of American Poetry</i>. His books of poetry include&nbsp;<i>Poems in the Manner Of</i>,&nbsp;<i>New and Selected Poems</i>,&nbsp;<i>Yeshiva Boys</i>,&nbsp;<i>When a Woman Loves a Man,&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;The Daily Mirror.</i> He lives in New York City and Ithaca, New York.Lehman's cheerfully eclectic, determinedly accessible and defiantly sex-positive collection&#x2014;a savvy extension of his successful Best American Poetry franchise&#x2014;marches from an unlikely beginning (On a Young Lady's Going into a Shower Bath by Francis Scott Key), past Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, through the modernist era (Conrad Aiken's truly sexy Sea Holly) and on to the present, where poets male and female, gay, straight and bisexual, describe bodies and pleasures in an array of verse forms. Sestinas abound; Lehman also finds a villanelle, a pantoum, a brace of sonnets and, not surprisingly, lots of swinging free verse. Lehman's best choices give off both heat and light: Dennis Cooper remembers the aches of eighth grade; Maggie Wells's Sonnet from the Groin approaches her own sex organs with bounce and honesty; and Bernadette Mayer's echoic couplets in First turn to me... evoke the lucky days at the start of a great romance, when sexual wishes are commands. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His findings both support the notion of ethnic distinctiveness and reveal the extent to which German Texans adopted the farming techniques of their Southern Anglo neighbors.</p></p><p>The late Terry G. Jordan held the Walter Prescott Webb Chair in History and Ideas in the geography department at the University of Texas at Austin."The lasting benefits Texas has received from its Germans mark our place names, our historic records, even our food and drink. Dr. Jordan's [book] makes this clear and is a valuable contribution to Texana." (<i>Dallas Morning News</i>)<br><br>"Detailed with maps, charts and pictures, the book is excellent reading for many Texans whose ancestors came to Texas direct from Europe." (<i>San Antonio Express</i>)<br><br>". . . an eminently readable book . . . in its recording of the adaptation of a transplanted human population to a new environment." (<i>West Texas Historical Association Year Book</i>)<br><br>"If one of my colleagues in American history asked me for a good book in geography, I would give him this one." (<i>Economic Geography</i>)<br><br>"It makes a contribution to the lore of the nineteenth-century immigrant; it throws some light on the history of Texas agriculture. Perhaps more important, however, is that the method of research as well as the method of presentation ... show that geographer and historian can collaborate to their mutual benefit."

Tabini-aiji, powerful ruler of the Western Association, along with Cajieri, his son and heir, and his human <i>paidhi</i>, Bren Cameron, have returned to the Bujavid, their seat of power. <br><br>But factions that remain loyal to the opposition are still present, and the danger these rebels pose is far from over. Since the rebellion, Bren Cameron's apartment in the capital has been occupied by an old noble family from the Southern district&#x2014;the same district from which the coup was initiated. This family now claims loyalty to Tabini, but the aiji is dubious. To avoid additional conflict, Bren has decided to visit Najida, his country estate on the west coast. <br><br> Tabini-aiji has once again take over the job of training his young son in the traditional ways of the <i>atevi</i>, and has Cajieri under strict supervision. But after two years in space, surrounded by human children, Cajieri bristles in this highly controlled and boring environment. Desperate for freedom and adventure, Cajieri escapes the tightly guarded Bujavid with his young bodyguards and sets out secretly to join Bren on the coast. <br><br> Determined to ensure his son&#x2019;s safety, Tabini recalls Ilisidi from her home in the East, asking her to find Cajieri and secure him at Bren&#x2019;s estate. But it has been a long time since Bren has been to Najida, and the war has shifted allegiances in many quarters. A district that once was considered a safe haven might now be a trap. And with Bren, Cajieri, and Ilisidi all under one roof and separated from their allies, that trap is now baited.</p><p><b>C. J. Cherryh&nbsp;</b>planned to write since the age of ten.

Dale Saunders Professor of Japanese Studies. In addition to his work on Buddhist cosmology and the &#34;mind&#34; of medieval Japan, he was a gifted translator and interpreter of poetry and published two volumes on the medieval monk-poet Saigyo. He was deeply interested in Zen, especially as a resource for contemporary thought. He wrote and edited several books and essays, introducing to Western readers the work of the thirteenth-century Zen master Dogen, the Kyoto-school figure Masao Abe, and the twentieth-century philosopher and cultural historian Watsuji Tetsuro. In 1989, he became the first non-Japanese to win the Watsuji Tetsuro Cultural Prize. In his later career, while continuing to study medieval Japanese religion and literature, he produced pioneering studies of Japanese bioethics, highlighting contrasts with Western approaches to such issues as abortion, organ transplants, and medical definitions of death.

Hate brings me to my knees, love gets me on my feet.<br><br>I glance at the bedside clock. Seven thirty. Stefanie let me sleep in. The fatigue of these final days has been severe. Apart from the physical strain, there is the exhausting torrent of emotions set loose by my pending retirement. Now, rising from the center of the fatigue comes the first wave of pain. I grab my back. It grabs me. I feel as if someone snuck in during the night and attached one of those anti-theft steering wheel locks to my spine. How can I play in the U.S. Open with the Club on my spine? Will the last match of my career be a forfeit?<br><br>I was born with spondylolisthesis, meaning a bottom vertebra that parted from the other vertebrae, struck out on its own, rebelled. (It&#x2019;s the main reason for my pigeon-toed walk.) With this one vertebra out of sync, there&#x2019;s less room for the nerves inside the column of my spine, and with the slightest movement the nerves feel that much more crowded. Throw in two herniated discs and a bone that won&#x2019;t stop growing in a futile effort to protect the damaged area, and those nerves start to feel downright claustrophobic. When the nerves protest their cramped quarters, when they send out distress signals, a pain runs up and down my leg that makes me suck in my breath and speak in tongues. At such moments the only relief is to lie down and wait. Sometimes, however, the moment arrives in the middle of a match. Then the only remedy is to alter my game&#x2014;swing differently, run differently, do everything differently. That&#x2019;s when my muscles spasm. Everyone avoids change; muscles can&#x2019;t abide it. Told to change, my muscles join the spinal rebellion, and soon my whole body is at war with itself.<br><br>Gil, my trainer, my friend, my surrogate father, explains it this way: Your body is saying it doesn&#x2019;t want to do this anymore.<br><br>My body has been saying that for a long time, I tell Gil. Almost as long as I&#x2019;ve been saying it.<br><br>Since January, however, my body has been shouting it. My body doesn&#x2019;t want to retire&#x2014;my body has already retired. My body has moved to Florida and bought a condo and white Sansabelts. So I&#x2019;ve been negotiating with my body, asking it to come out of retirement for a few hours here, a few hours there. Much of this negotiation revolves around a cortisone shot that temporarily dulls the pain. Before the shot works, however, it causes its own torments.<br><br>I got one yesterday, so I could play tonight. It was the third shot this year, the thirteenth of my career, and by far the most alarming. The doctor, not my regular doctor, told me brusquely to assume the position. I stretched out on his table, face down, and his nurse yanked down my shorts. The doctor said he needed to get his seven-inch needle as close to the inflamed nerves as possible. But he couldn&#x2019;t enter directly, because my herniated discs and bone spur were blocking the path. His attempts to circumvent them, to break the Club, sent me through the roof. First he inserted the needle. Then he positioned a big machine over my back to see how close the needle was to the nerves. He needed to get that needle almost flush against the nerves, he said, without actually touching. If it were to touch the nerves, even if it were to only nick the nerves, the pain would ruin me for the tournament. It could also be life- changing. In and out and around, he maneuvered the needle, until my eyes filled with water.<br><br>Finally he hit the spot. Bull&#x2019;s- eye, he said.<br><br>In went the cortisone. The burning sensation made me bite my lip. Then came the pressure. I felt infused, embalmed. The tiny space in my spine where the nerves are housed began to feel vacuum packed. The pressure built until I thought my back would burst.<br><br>Pressure is how you know everything&#x2019;s working, the doctor said.<br><br>Words to live by, Doc.<br><br>Soon the pain felt wonderful, almost sweet, because it was the kind that you can tell precedes relief. But maybe all pain is like that.<br>MY FAMILY IS GROWING LOUDER. I limp out to the living room of our suite. My son, Jaden, and my daughter, Jaz, see me and scream. Daddy, Daddy! They jump up and down and want to leap on me. I stop and brace myself, stand before them like a mime imitating a tree in winter. They stop just before leaping, because they know Daddy is delicate these days, Daddy will shatter if they touch him too hard. I pat their faces and kiss their cheeks and join them at the breakfast table. <br><br>Jaden asks if today is the day.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>You&#x2019;re playing?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>And then after today are you <i>retire?</i><br><br>A new word he and his younger sister have learned. <i>Retired</i>. When they say it, they always leave off the last letter. For them it&#x2019;s <i>retire</i>, forever ongoing, permanently in the present tense. Maybe they know something I don&#x2019;t.<br><br>Not if I win, son. If I win tonight, I keep playing.<br><br>But if you lose&#x2014; we can have a dog?<br><br>To the children, retire equals puppy. Stefanie and I have promised them that when I stop training, when we stop traveling the world, we can buy a puppy. Maybe we&#x2019;ll name him Cortisone.<br><br>Yes, buddy, when I lose, we will buy a dog.<br><br>He smiles. He hopes Daddy loses, hopes Daddy experiences the disappointment that surpasses all others. He doesn&#x2019;t understand&#x2014; and how will I ever be able to explain it to him?&#x2014;the pain of losing, the pain of playing. It&#x2019;s taken me nearly thirty years to understand it myself, to solve the calculus of my own psyche.<br><br>I ask Jaden what he&#x2019;s doing today.<br><br>Going to see the bones.<br><br>I look at Stefanie. She reminds me she&#x2019;s taking them to the Museum of Natural History. Dinosaurs. I think of my twisted vertebrae. I think of my skeleton on display at the museum with all the other dinosaurs. Tennis-aurus Rex.<br><br>Jaz interrupts my thoughts. She hands me her muffin. She needs me to pick out the blueberries before she eats it. Our morning ritual. Each blueberry must be surgically removed, which requires precision, concentration. Stick the knife in, move it around, get it right up to the blueberry without touching. I focus on her muffin and it&#x2019;s a relief to think about something other than tennis. But as I hand her the muffin, I can&#x2019;t pretend that it doesn&#x2019;t feel like a tennis ball, which makes the muscles in my back twitch with anticipation. The time is drawing near.<br>AFTER BREAKFAST, after Stefanie and the kids have kissed me goodbye and run off to the museum, I sit quietly at the table, looking around the suite. It&#x2019;s like every hotel suite I&#x2019;ve ever had, only more so. Clean, chic, comfortable&#x2014; it&#x2019;s the Four Seasons, so it&#x2019;s lovely, but it&#x2019;s still just another version of what I call Not Home. The non-place we exist as athletes. I close my eyes, try to think about tonight, but my mind drifts backward. My mind these days has a natural backspin. Given half a chance it wants<br>to return to the beginning, because I&#x2019;m so close to the end. But I can&#x2019;t let it. Not yet. I can&#x2019;t afford to dwell too long on the past. I get up and walk around the table, test my balance. When I feel fairly steady I walk gingerly to the shower.<br><br>Under the hot water I groan and scream. I bend slowly, touch my quads, start to come alive. My muscles loosen. My skin sings. My pores fly open. Warm blood goes sluicing through my veins. I feel something begin to stir. Life. Hope. The last drops of youth. Still, I make no sudden movements. I don&#x2019;t want to do anything to startle my spine. I let my spine sleep in.<br><br>Standing at the bathroom mirror, toweling off, I stare at my face. Red eyes, gray stubble&#x2014; a face totally different from the one with which I started. But also different from the one I saw last year in this same mirror. Whoever I might be, I&#x2019;m not the boy who started this odyssey, and I&#x2019;m not even the man who announced three months ago that the odyssey was coming to an end. I&#x2019;m like a tennis racket on which I&#x2019;ve replaced the grip four times and the strings seven times&#x2014; is it accurate to call it the same racket? Somewhere in those eyes, however, I can still vaguely see the boy who didn&#x2019;t want to play tennis in the first place, the boy who wanted to quit, the boy who <i>did</i> quit many times. I see that golden- haired boy who hated tennis, and I wonder how he would view this bald man, who still hates tennis and yet still plays. Would he be shocked? Amused? Proud? The question makes me weary, lethargic, and it&#x2019;s only noon.<br><br>Please let this be over.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not ready for it to be over.<br><br>The finish line at the end of a career is no different from the finish line at the end of a match. The objective is to get within reach of that finish line, because then it gives off a magnetic force. When you&#x2019;re close, you can feel that force pulling you, and you can use that force to get across. But just before you come within range, or just after, you feel another force, equally strong, pushing you away. It&#x2019;s inexplicable, mystical, these twin forces, these contradictory energies, but they both exist. I know, because I&#x2019;ve spent much of my life seeking the one, fighting the other, and sometimes I&#x2019;ve been stuck, suspended, bounced like a tennis ball<br>between the two.<br><br>Tonight: I remind myself that it will require iron discipline to cope with these forces, and whatever else comes my way. Back pain, bad shots, foul weather, self- loathing. It&#x2019;s a form of worry, this reminder, but also a meditation. One thing I&#x2019;ve learned in twenty-nine years of playing tennis: Life will throw everything but the kitchen sink in your path, and then it will throw the kitchen sink. It&#x2019;s your job to avoid the obstacles. If you let them stop you or distract you, you&#x2019;re not doing your job, and failing to do your job will cause regrets that paralyze you more than a bad back.<br><br>I lie on the bed with a glass of water and read. When my eyes get tired I click on the TV. <i>Tonight, Round Two of the U.S. Open! Will this be Andre Agassi&#x2019;s farewell</i>? My face flashes on the screen. A different face than the one in the mirror. My game face. I study this new reflection of me in the distorted mirror that is TV and my anxiety rises another click or two.<br>Was that the final commercial? The final time CBS will ever promote one of my matches?<br><br>I can&#x2019;t escape the feeling that I&#x2019;m about to die.<br><br>It&#x2019;s no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life. Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic elements of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature. Even the structure of tennis, the way the pieces fit inside one another like Russian nesting dolls, mimics the structure of our days. Points become games become sets become tournaments, and it&#x2019;s all so tightly connected that any point can become the turning point. It reminds me of the way seconds become minutes become hours, and any hour can be our finest. Or darkest. It&#x2019;s our choice.<br><br>But if tennis is life, then what follows tennis must be the unknowable void. The thought makes me cold.<br><br>Stefanie bursts through the door with the kids. They flop on the bed, and my son asks how I&#x2019;m feeling.<br><br>Fine, fine. How were the bones?<br><br>Fun!<br><br>Stefanie gives them sandwiches and juice and hustles them out the door again.<br><br>They have a playdate, she says.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t we all.<br><br>Now I can take a nap. At thirty- six, the only way I can play a late match, which could go past midnight, is if I get a nap beforehand. Also, now that I know roughly who I am, I want to close my eyes and hide from it. When I open my eyes, one hour has passed. I say aloud, It&#x2019;s time. No more hiding. I step into the shower again, but this shower is different from the morning shower. The afternoon shower is always longer&#x2014;twenty-two minutes, give or take&#x2014; and it&#x2019;s not for waking up or getting<br>clean. The afternoon shower is for encouraging myself, coaching myself.<br><br>Tennis is the sport in which you talk to yourself. No athletes talk to themselves like tennis players. Pitchers, golfers, goalkeepers, they mutter to themselves, of course, but tennis players <i>talk</i> to themselves&#x2014;and <i>answer</i>. In the heat of a match, tennis players look like lunatics in a public square, ranting and swearing and conducting Lincoln-Douglas debates with their alter egos. Why? Because tennis is so damned lonely. Only boxers can understand the loneliness of tennis players&#x2014;and yet boxers have their corner men and managers. Even a boxer&#x2019;s opponent provides a kind of companionship, someone he can grapple with and grunt at. In tennis you stand face- to- face with the enemy, trade blows with him, but never touch him or talk to him, or anyone else. The rules forbid a tennis player from even talking to his coach while on the court. People sometimes mention the track-and-field runner as a comparably lonely figure, but I have to laugh. At least the runner can feel and smell his opponents. They&#x2019;re inches away. In tennis you&#x2019;re on an island. Of all the games men and women play, tennis is the closest to solitary confinement, which inevitably leads to self- talk, and for me the self-talk starts here in the afternoon shower. This is when I begin to say things to myself, crazy things, over and over, until I believe them. For instance, that a quasi-cripple can compete at the U.S. Open. That a thirty-six-year-old man can beat an opponent just entering his prime. I&#x2019;ve won 869 matches in my career, fifth on the all-time list, and many were won during the afternoon shower.<br><br>With the water roaring in my ears&#x2014; a sound not unlike twenty thousand fans&#x2014;I recall particular wins. Not wins the fans would remember, but wins that still wake me at night. Squillari in Paris. Blake in New York. Pete in Australia. Then I recall a few losses. I shake my head at the disappointments. I tell myself that tonight will be an exam for which I&#x2019;ve been studying twenty-nine years. Whatever happens tonight, I&#x2019;ve already be...</p><h2>The Language of Life: A Festival of Poets</h2><p>"Poets live the lives all of us live," says Bill Moyers, "with one big difference. They have the power--the power of the word--to create a world of thoughts and emotions other can share. We only have to learn to listen."<br>In a series of fascinating conversations with thirty-four American poets, <i>The Language Of Life</i> celebrates language in its "most exalted, wrenching, delighted, and concentrated form," and its unique power to re-create the human experience: falling in love, facing death, leaving home, playing basketball, losing faith, finding God. Listening to Linda McCarriston's award-winning poems about a child trapped in a violent home, or to Jimmy Santiago Baca explaining how words changed his life in prison, or to David Mura describing his Japanese American grandfather's experience in relocation camps, or to Sekou Sundiata stitching the magic of his childhood church in Harlem to the African tradition of storytelling, or to Gary Snyder invoking the natural wonder of mountains and rivers, or to Adrienne Rich calling for honesty in human relations, all testify to the necessity and clarity of the poet's voice, and all give hope that from such a wide variety of racial, ethnic, and religious threads we might yet weave a new American fabric.<br>"'Listen,' said the storytellers of old, 'listen and you shall <i>hear</i>,'" explains Bill Moyers. <i>The Language Of Life</i> is a joyous, life-affirming invitation to listen, learn, and experience the exhilarating power of the spoken word.</p><p>In a series of fascinating conversations with thirty-four American poets, and in dozens of poems, <b>The Language of Life</b> celebrates language in its "most exalted, wrenching, delighted, and concentrated form," and its unique power to re-create the human experience: falling in love, facing death, leaving home, playing basketball, losing faith, finding God.

With some antiquated (and some not so antiquated) materia medica of sorts within its pages, it is notable for its illustrations as much as its recipes. It is also a fairly good symbol of its era- that of late pre-modern medicine and its fusion of standardization and experimentation with herbal and physical compounds often used for hundreds of years or longer before the 19th century began.</p><p></p><h2>The Innocents: A Novel</h2><p><b>From prizewinning author Michael Crummey comes a spellbinding story of survival in which a brother and sister confront the limits of human endurance and their own capacity for loyalty and forgiveness.</b><br>A brother and sister are orphaned in an isolated cove on Newfoundland's northern coastline. Their home is a stretch of rocky shore governed by the feral ocean, by a relentless pendulum of abundance and murderous scarcity. Still children with only the barest notion of the outside world, they have nothing but the family's boat and the little knowledge passed on haphazardly by their mother and father to keep them. <br><br>Muddling though the severe round of the seasons, through years of meagre catches and storms and ravaging illness, it is their fierce loyalty to each other that motivates and sustains them. But as seasons pass and they wade deeper into the mystery of their own natures, even that loyalty will be tested. <br><br><i>The Innocents </i>is richly imagined and compulsively readable, a riveting story of hardship and survival, and an unflinching exploration of the bond between brother and sister. By turns electrifying and heartbreaking, it is a testament to the bounty and barbarity of the world, to the wonders and strangeness of our individual selves.</p><p>MICHAEL CRUMMEY is an award-winning poet and storyteller.

Powers has received a MacArthur Fellowship, a Lannan Literary Award and the James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Historical Fiction. He lives in Illinois.</p><p>WEB: RICHARDPOWERS.NET<br>FACEBOOK: RICHARD POWERS</p>Childhood innocence--imperiled through the ages and nowhere more at risk than in the heart of modern Los Angeles--stands as the imposing theme of Powers's latest complex, wrenching saga. As overwhelming and erudite as its acclaimed predecessor, The Gold Bug Variations (1991), here evidence of children at odds with the adult world in which they live abounds, from the legend of the Pied Piper to tragic details of the Children's Crusade to more recent obliterations of youthful dreams in Southeast Asia and Watts. Holding this savage, sorrowful indictment of post-adolescent behavior together is the tale of a pediatrics ward in an inner-city hospital, into which the world's indigent wounded are thrown with abandon. Cared for by a fiercely protective therapist and a sensitive surgical resident--themselves careworn and devastated by traumas of youth, but seeking redemption--the ward acquires a life and plan of its own when Joy, a Laotian boat girl whose ravenous appetite for knowledge cannot stave off the rot consuming her from the ankles up, and Nicolino, a street-wise, shrewd trader in comics and other commodities wizened well before his time by Methuselah Syndrome, take the situation in hand. Using a ward-wide production of the Pied Piper story presented to the outside world as their means, they plot a mass escape in order to become masters of their own fates--but their designs for liberation falter before the realities of disease and adult agendas. Mingling wisps of whimsy and a hard-edged, surgical view, this cuts deeply into the human condition--to a dark, profoundly troubled place where hope and despair exist side by side. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This feeling of surprise, astonishment, and wonder in the face of the unknowable ought to be returned to its locus: that of sexual difference." Thus Luce Irigaray undertakes a searching inquiry into what may be the philosophical problem of our age. Irigaray approaches the question of sexual difference by looking at the ways in which thought and language&#x2015;whether in philosophy, science, or psychoanalysis&#x2015;are gendered. She juxtaposes evocative readings of classic texts, including Plato's Symposium, Aristotle's Physics, Descartes's "On Wonder" in The Passions of the Soul, Spinoza's Ethics, Merleau-Ponty's The Visible and the Invisible, and Levinas's Totality and Infinity, with meditations on experiences of love: between fetus and mother, between heterosexual lovers, between women, and between women and their own bodies. </p><p>Exploding traditional dualities such as inside/outside, form/content, subject/object, and self/other, Irigaray shows how an understanding of such experiences points to gender blindness in both classic and contemporary theory. Asserting that women have never known a love of self out of which a non-dominated love of the other is possible, Irigaray argues that only when women insist on the integrity of their own spaces of embodiment can love become the basis of a revolution in ethics.</p><p>Published in French in 1984, An Ethics of Sexual Difference is now available in English<br>in a superb translation by Carolyn Burke and Gillian C. Gill. Readers interested in feminist theory, literary theory, and philosophy&#x2015;indeed anyone deeply concerned with gender relations&#x2015;will be challenged by the brilliance and boldness of Irigaray's analyses.</p></p><p>Luce Irigaray, a trained, psychoanalyst, has two doctorates, one in linguistics and one in philosophy. Her books include <i>Speculum of the Other,</i> <i>This Sex Which is Not One</i>, and <i>Ethics of Sexual Difference</i>, all published by Cornell University Press.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Alexey Brodovitch</h2><p>Alexey Brodovitch (1898-1971) is a legend among graphic designers. A Russian who fled the Bolshevik Revolution to settle eventually in Paris and then New York, Brodovitch was one of the pioneers of graphic design in the twentieth century.<br><br>Brodovitch was Art Director of <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> for over two decades (1934-58); he designed and produced several exquisite and highly collectable books with collaborators such as Richard Avedon and Andr� Kert�sz; he was a talented photographer himself; and, through an informal class called the Design Lab in New York, he trained a younger generation of photographers and designers who went on to become famous artists and art directors in their own right.<br><br>This book is a comprehensive monograph on Brodovitch's life and work, drawing from interviews with a wide spectrum of colleagues and collaborators - and assimilating previously unpublished material from archives and private collections around the world - to offer an in-depth analysis and appreciation of Brodovitch's unique and lasting contribution to the visual arts.</p><p>Kerry William Purcell is a writer, lecturer and freelance picture editor. A former archivist at The Photographers&#39; Gallery in London, he has written widely on film and photography.Although the name Alexey Brodovitch may not be familiar to everyone, in the world of graphic arts it speaks volumes. Designer, photographer, and interior designer Brodovitch reigned as art director of Harper's Bazaar from 1934 until 1958. Working with artists such as Man Ray, Richard Avedon, and Henri Cartier-Bresson, he dramatically altered American magazine design. The double-page spread was one of his signature innovations, as was the emphasis on negative space in layouts. This book, with examples of some of his finest work, is the catalog for an exhibition held at the Maison Europ?ene de la Photographie in Paris last year. It is also the first significant Brodovitch publication since 1989. The illustrated index, drop cover, and full-page facsimile reproductions make for a very attractive presentation, though the wide-column pages of text are maddening to read. Highly recommended for art and design libraries.AMargarete Gross, Chicago P.L. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Deep Healing</h2><p>Change the way you look at health and healing!</p><p>Although best known for his seminal work as a co-creator of the field of holistic health and Mind-Body Medicine, Dr Miller is also a musician, physician and scientist, has earned degrees in Medicine (Albert Einstein College of Medicine) and Mathematics (Trinity College), and has been elected to Sigma Pi Sigma, National Physics Honor Society. His chief discoveries were that thoughts, emotions and mental images have profound effects on health and performance. Computer literate since the 1960s, he realised that the human biocomputer, the mind, thinks and feels the way it was programmed, and that the use of self-induced altered states (similar to meditation and hypnosis) could be used to gain access to the &#39;source code&#39;. Applying his clinical skills, wisdom and logic, he invented the first meditation tapes, called Software for the Mind. They introduced the world to deep relaxation and guided imagery, and have remained the choice of conventional as well as complementary and alternative health professionals for more than 35 years. Often described as a &#39;contemporary shaman&#39;, he is a trainer, coach, speaker and tireless worker in the service of planetary transformation through his Leadership Institute for Global Healing and Transformation (LIGHT). His book, Deep Healing; The Essence of Mind-Body Medicine, presents the results of his careful, patient-centered research into the process of healing and transformation, as it applies to health, happiness and peak performance.

Do you just feel like you're always behind on things you want to accomplish because you have low energy? Are you looking for natural remedies because conventional medicine has caused you problems or worse symptoms?Welcome to the second book in my series about healing your thyroid. In the first book, we looked at essential oils that you can use to help heal your thyroid and how they work. In this book, we are going in a different direction; fermented foods. All types of pickled or fermented foods can help; they feed probiotics, or healthy bacteria, to your digestive system, as well as digestive enzymes and native yeasts, to help your body to digest what you eat. All of these contribute directly to healthy gut flora and that, in turn, leads to a healthy thyroid. How? Because many of the foods that you eat now contain goitrogens, which do not do your thyroid any good at all, but pickling can neutralize or, at least, reduce these sufficiently that they do not contribute towards a goiter or an enlarged thyroid.What I intend to do in this book is tell you how your thyroid works before talking about food &#x2013; that incudes goitrogens, dairy and fermented foods. I will then explain how to ferment your foods and providing you with some useful recipes. <b>Ready to help your thyroid heal and make a step toward your full potential?

She was on a mission.</p><p>The ten-point list made perfect sense to her. She&#x2019;d fine-tuned it, but really, she&#x2019;d had this list in her head for a while now, and decided it was time to memorialize it, get it down on paper. Maybe even laminate it.</p><p>Chelsea was thirty-two years old, and the one thing she knew and knew well was men. She had years of dating history, and she could weed out a decent man from a loser in the first fifteen minutes of a date.</p><p>She should write a book about it. She&#x2019;d probably make millions.</p><p>Okay, in reality, maybe not. But she had a lot of experience in dating. She could offer up some valuable advice. At least advice on how to date the wrong man. Had she ever dated a lot of the wrong men. She was an expert on that. </p><p>Hence the list.</p><p>Her list would ensure she found the right man&#x2014;finally. She was tired of going out on useless dates. From now on, she was going to ask the correct questions so she wouldn&#x2019;t waste any more time on the wrong man. If a prospective date didn&#x2019;t meet the criteria on her list, then he wasn&#x2019;t the perfect man for her.</p><p>Her list wasn&#x2019;t going to focus on personality traits&#x2014;she already knew in her head the type of guy she wanted&#x2014;warm, caring, compassionate, with a sense of humor. If he didn&#x2019;t possess those basics, he&#x2019;d be out of the running before they even got started. And those she could suss out right away without a list. Nor did she have a preference for looks. No, this list was compatibility-based. That&#x2019;s where she&#x2019;d run into roadblocks in the past and where she was going to focus her efforts on in the future.</p><p>She scanned her list, nodding as she ticked off the attributes in her head.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Never married. Guys with exes carry a lot of baggage and woes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Has to be a suit and tie kind of guy, because it means he cares about his appearance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Has to work a 9-to-5 job, so he&#x2019;ll be available for her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;No crazy ex-girlfriends. This one needs no explanation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Likes fine dining and good wine. No more burger joints! Some guy out there must like something other than hamburgers, right? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Hates sports. Everything about sports. What is it with men and sports, anyway?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Must want at least two kids. A man who doesn&#x2019;t want children is a deal breaker.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Must love animals&#x2014;preferably big dogs, not those yippy little dogs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Doesn&#x2019;t spend all his time at the bar with his friends. If he&#x2019;s always hanging out at the bar with his friends, then he isn&#x2019;t with her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Idea of a perfect vacation getaway is somewhere warm and tropical. With room service.<p>She studied the list, tapping the pencil on the bar top.</p><p>&#x201c;You look deep in thought.&#x201d;</p><p>Her head shot up as Sebastian &#x201c;Bash&#x201d; Palmer, the owner of the bar, stood in front of her.</p><p>Talk about the wrong guy. Bash was the epitome of wrong, on so many levels.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. working on something.&#x201d;</p><p>He cocked a dark brow. &#x201c;Yeah? I noticed you were intently focused on writing. So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. grocery list?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Funny. And no.&#x201d;</p><p>He leaned over, trying to sneak a peek. &#x201c;The perfect&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>She shut the notebook. &#x201c;None of your business.&#x201d;</p><p>He laid the rag on the bar. &#x201c;Hmm. The perfect something. The perfect steak. That was it, wasn&#x2019;t it? You&#x2019;ve got some secret recipe for the perfect steak. That&#x2019;s the way to a man&#x2019;s heart, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You think I&#x2019;d try to capture a man by cooking? Well, you&#x2019;re wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>He laid his palms on the edge of the bar. &#x201c;So, it does have something to do with a guy, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>She refused to take the bait. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that.&#x201d;</p><p>A couple guys came into the bar and took a seat.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not done talking about this,&#x201d; he said, his stormy gray eyes making contact with hers before he walked away.</p><p>Oh, they were so done talking about it.</p><p>Typical Bash, always up in her business.</p><p>And he was definitely the wrong type of man for her.</p><p>While Bash attended to his customers, she opened the notebook and checked her list.</p><p>Yes, Bash was the perfect example of the wrong type of guy. She mentally ticked off all the items on her list that he <i>didn&#x2019;t</i> fit.</p><p>He was divorced. He was a jeans and T-shirt kind of guy. And while he might look super hot in said jeans and T-shirt, it still counted against him.</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t sure he even owned a suit. As owner of the No Hope at All bar, he worked terrible hours. As a teacher, she worked during the day, and he worked afternoons and evenings. They&#x2019;d never see each other.</p><p>She had no idea who he was dating, but he was always going out with some woman or another, so he likely had some crazy ex-girlfriend somewhere in his past. She knew he was a beer and hard liquor guy, and his idea of fine dining was a burger and onion rings from Bert&#x2019;s. He wouldn&#x2019;t know fine dining if he fell into it. She had no idea how he felt about kids, but the guy practically lived at the bar, and he hadn&#x2019;t had a serious relationship since his divorce, so it wasn&#x2019;t like he was in any hurry to have children. Plus, he didn&#x2019;t have any animals.</p><p>Then again, she didn&#x2019;t have pets, either. But that wasn&#x2019;t her fault. Her apartment didn&#x2019;t allow them. She just wanted to make sure whatever guy she ended up with loved them. She wanted a dog. Or a cat. Her best friend Emma had two dogs, Daisy and Annie, and her other best friend Jane had a dog. Logan and Des had several dogs on their ranch.</p><p>She&#x2019;d always wanted pets, and she hadn&#x2019;t had one since her childhood dog, Scotty. She&#x2019;d missed having a dog to cuddle with. </p><p>She shook her head. Back to her list. She scrolled down the list and stopped at the next item.</p><p>Oh, right. Not hanging out at the bar with the guys all night. That answer was self-explanatory, since that was pretty much all Bash did. All the time.</p><p>She knew he loved sports because there were several TVs set up at the bar, and Bash was always cheering for some team or another. The man was sports-crazy.</p><p>And she had no idea what his idea of a perfect vacation would be, but she highly doubted it involved room service. Bash had an ATV and she knew he was an outdoorsy kind of guy.</p><p>Whereas Chelsea was allergic to everything outdoorsy. Anything involving the outdoors typically meant you couldn&#x2019;t wear high heels, and Chelsea lived for her heels.</p><p>See? They were not compatible in the least. Bash had failed everything on her list.</p><p>She closed her notebook and tucked it back into her purse.</p><p>Why was she even comparing Bash to her list, anyway? It wasn&#x2019;t like he was remotely in the running. Even if there had been that night she and the girls had come here during the holidays. And maybe she had been a little on the inebriated side, and maybe Bash had whispered something in her ear that even several months later still made her blush hot, and still kept her up at night thinking about&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;The perfect drink.&#x201d;</p><p>She pulled herself out of that very erotic daydream and met Bash&#x2019;s teasing gaze. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were going to give me ideas for the perfect drink. That&#x2019;s what you were writing in your secret notebook, right? I know you like to challenge me.&#x201d;</p><p>She sighed. &#x201c;Believe it or not, Bash, not everything is about you.&#x201d;</p><p>He feigned a shocked look. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not?&#x201d;</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;What are we talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>Her best friends, Emma and Jane, grabbed seats on either side of her.</p><p>&#x201c;Chelsea&#x2019;s hitting on me,&#x201d; Bash said.</p><p>&#x201c;She is?&#x201d; Emma grinned at her.</p><p>&#x201c;I am not hitting on Bash. He&#x2019;s being ridiculous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s writing love notes to me in her notebook and won&#x2019;t let me see them.&#x201d;</p><p>She shot him a glare. &#x201c;Are you twelve? Stop it.&#x201d;</p><p>Jane looked over at her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re writing love notes? To Bash? This is the most interesting thing that&#x2019;s happened all day. Please continue.&#x201d;</p><p>She was going to throw her drink at Bash. &#x201c;No. I am not writing love notes to Bash.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then who are you writing them to?&#x201d; Emma asked.</p><p>Chelsea wanted to scream. &#x201c;No one. No love notes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t want you to see them, because they&#x2019;re for me,&#x201d; Bash said.</p><p>Emma looked at Bash, then at Chelsea, a questioning look in her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s full of it,&#x201d; Chelsea said. &#x201c;And he&#x2019;s just giving me a hard time, because that&#x2019;s what he does.&#x201d;</p><p>Bash slanted her that look again, the one he&#x2019;d given her that night a few months back. Smoldering. Filled with promise. The kind of look that made her squirm on her barstool.</p><p>&#x201c;I have never given you a hard time, Chelsea.&#x201d; And as if he hadn&#x2019;t just infuriated her, he calmly asked, &#x201c;What would you ladies like to drink?&#x201d;</p><p>Jane and Emma both ordered sodas, so Bash poured their sodas, then went off to tend to his other customers.</p><p>&#x201c;He drives me crazy,&#x201d; Chelsea said.</p><p>Jane cocked her head to the side, studying Bash&#x2019;s retreating form. &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know, Chelse. He&#x2019;s funny. And so hot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He is not.&#x201d; Chelsea refused to acknowledge the way Bash&#x2019;s black T-shirt fit so snugly across his incredible chest, or the bulge of his biceps beneath the hem of the shirt. Or his flat abs, or his incredible ass.</p><p>Not that she&#x2019;d noticed. At. All.</p><p>&#x201c;This is true,&#x201d; Emma said. &#x201c;Why haven&#x2019;t you ever dated him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bash?&#x201d; Chelsea slid a look down the bar at him, then at Emma. &#x201c;Totally not my type.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma laughed. &#x201c;I think Bash is every woman&#x2019;s type. Tall, great muscles, killer smile&#x2014;and those eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Phenomenal butt, those tattoos, a goatee. We have discussed your standards being impossibly high, haven&#x2019;t we, Chelsea?&#x201d;</p><p>Chelsea shifted her attention to Jane. &#x201c;Like I said. He&#x2019;s not my type. I&#x2019;ll just leave it at that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what exactly is your type, Chelsea?&#x201d; Jane asked. &#x201c;Are you holding out for royalty or something?&#x201d;</p><p>She lifted her chin. &#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ve actually made a list.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma&#x2019;s brows arched. &#x201c;A list? What kind of list?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A list of the qualities I&#x2019;d like my perfect man to have.&#x201d;</p><p>Jane laid her hand on Chelsea&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Honey. You do realize the perfect man doesn&#x2019;t exist.&#x201d;</p><p>Chelsea took another look in Bash&#x2019;s direction, then turned her back to him. &#x201c;Yes, he does. The perfect man does exist. And trust me, it isn&#x2019;t Bash.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>BASH BUSIED HIMSELF with his customers. On a Friday night, the No Hope at All bar would be filling up as people got off work and came in for drinks and to play pool or watch sports on several of the televisions scattered around.</p><p>While he drew a few tap beers for some of his regulars, he kept an eye on Chelsea, who was waving her hands as she animatedly explained something to Jane and Emma.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>That woman was a piece of work. A hot, sexy, redheaded piece of work.</p><p>He knew he had to steer clear of women like Chelsea. She was not the type of woman for him.</p><p>No woman was. Easy, no-strings relationships were perfect. They&#x2019;d satisfied him for years, and he saw no reason they couldn&#x2019;t continue to keep him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </p><p>Maybe <i>happy</i> wasn&#x2019;t the right word. He hadn&#x2019;t been happy since the day he&#x2019;d gotten married. Even that happiness had been short-lived. </p><p>Content. That worked. Nothing wrong with content. </p><p>He shifted his attention as Luke McCormack came in. Luke wore a T-shirt and jeans instead of his Hope police officer uniform, so he must be off duty. Bash grabbed a bottle of Luke&#x2019;s favorite beer from the cooler and popped the top off, sliding it across the bar while Emma, Luke&#x2019;s wife, came over and gave him a kiss. Then Jane and Chelsea moved over as well.</p><p>&#x201c;Just get off work?&#x201d; he asked Luke.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for showing up, man. You know I hate these lonely Friday afternoons.&#x201d;</p><p>Luke took a long pull of his beer, then set it down and looked around. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re never lonely, Bash. Besides, the place is picking up. You&#x2019;ve always got a crowd in here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Business is looking great.&#x201d;</p><p>Luke nodded. &#x201c;You should consider offering food.&#x201d;</p><p>Bash leaned against the bar and nodded. &#x201c;Funny you should mention that. I&#x2019;m thinking of expanding the back of the bar on the east side and adding a kitchen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How hard would that be?&#x201d; Chelsea asked. &#x201c;Because if you serve food, you could really draw in a lot more people.&#x201d;</p><p>He cocked a brow. &#x201c;I bring in a good-sized crowd already, and I don&#x2019;t want to offer a big menu. Just bar-type food.&#x201d;</p><p>Chelsea wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;You mean like burgers or wings and stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>He grinned. &#x201c;Something like that. I&#x2019;ve had the plans drawn up for a while. I just need to pull the trigger on it, get the permits, and start the project.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great idea, Bash,&#x201d; Luke said.</p><p>Chelsea sighed and sipped her soda. &#x201c;What Hope really needs is a place that offers fine dining.&#x201d;</p><p>Bash shook his head. &#x201c;You can go into Tulsa for that. We&#x2019;re too small a town for a fine-dining restaurant. It wouldn&#x2019;t get the draw. Folks here like their small-town restaurants, bars, and easy comfort food.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I agree,&#x201d; Jane said. &#x201c;Tulsa&#x2019;s just a short drive, and there are lots of restaurants to eat at there.&#x201d;</p><p>Chelsea played with her straw. &#x201c;I suppose.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could always move to Tulsa,&#x201d; Bash said. &#x201c;Then you&#x2019;d be near all that fine dining and culture.&#x201d;</p><p>She cocked a brow. &#x201c;Trying to get rid of me, Bash?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope. I like you just fine right where you&#x2019;re sitting.&#x201d;</p><p>She gave him a confused look, and he smiled at her.</p><p>He loved teasing her, maybe because she made it so easy. He was about to say something, but then there was a commotion at the front door. A woman had walked in with a dog, drawing everyone&#x2019;s attention.</p><p>Oh, shit. Gerri.</p><p>&#x201c;Aww, who&#x2019;s the cute brunette with the Chihuahua?&#x201d; Emma asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back,&#x201d; Bash said.</p><p>He moved around the bar and caught Gerri by the arm as she stalked her way in. He could tell by the look on her face that she was ready to do battle.</p><p>He pulled her to the side of the room.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Gerri. What brings you here?&#x201d;</p><p>She handed Lulu to him. &#x201c;Here. You take her.&#x201d;</p><p>He barely had time to catch the poor dog before it went tumbling to the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;Hang on. What am I supposed to do with your dog?&#x201d;</p><p>Gerri wagged her finger at him. &#x201c;No. Now she&#x2019;s <i>your</i> dog. I only got her to impress you, which apparently was an epic fail, since you broke up with me.&#x201d;</p><p>The poor dog trembled against his chest. He wrapped both arms around her to comfort her. The dog, that is. Not the obviously batshit-crazy woman currently glaring at him.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait. You bought this dog to impress a guy? What the hell, Gerri. I never asked you to get a dog. I thought you wanted this dog.&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged and affected a pout, her full lips glossed to the max.</p><p>&#x201c;She pees. Like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. everywhere. And barks at everything. And shakes. She&#x2019;s a pain and I can&#x2019;t deal.

Each turn reveals something new in a way that builds on the image on the previous page. Now that I&#x2019;m an illustrator myself, I&#x2019;ve often thought about this dramatic storytelling device and all of its creative possibilities. </p><p> My new book, <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i>, is a 550 page novel in words and pictures. But unlike most novels, the images in my new book don't just illustrate the story; they help tell it. I've used the lessons I learned from Remy Charlip and other masters of the picture book to create something that is not a exactly a novel, not quite a picture book, not really a graphic novel, or a flip book or a movie, but a combination of all these things. </p><p> I began thinking about this book ten years ago after seeing some of the magical films of Georges M�li�s, the father of science-fiction movies. But it wasn&#x2019;t until I read a book called <i>Edison's Eve: The Quest for Mechanical Life</i> by Gaby Woods that my story began to come into focus. I discovered that M�li�s had a collection of mechanical, wind-up figures (called automata) that were donated to a museum, but which were later destroyed and thrown away. Instantly, I imagined a boy discovering these broken, rusty machines in the garbage, stealing one and attempting to fix it. At that moment, Hugo Cabret was born. </p><p> A few years ago, I had the honor of meeting Remy Charlip, and I'm proud to say that we've become friends. Last December he was asking me what I was working on, and as I was describing this book to him, I realized that Remy looks exactly like Georges M�li�s. I excitedly asked him to pose as the character in my book, and fortunately, he said yes. So every time you see M�li�s in <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i>, the person you are really looking at is my dear friend Remy Charlip, who continues to inspire everyone who has the great pleasure of knowing him or seeing his work. </p><p> Paris in the 1930's, a thief, a broken machine, a strange girl, a mean old man, and the secrets that tie them all together... Welcome to <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i>. </p><p> Yours, </p><p> Brian Selznick </p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br><br><b>Amazon.com Exclusive</b><br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Brian Selznick on a "Deleted Scene" from <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i></b><br><br>This is a finished drawing that I had to cut from <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i>. I was still rewriting the book when I had to begin the final art. There was originally a scene in the story where this character, Etienne, is working in a camera shop. On one of my research trips to Paris I spent an entire day visiting old camera shops and photographing cameras from the 1930's and earlier, as well as the facades of the shops themselves. I researched original French camera posters and made sure that the counter and the shelves were accurate to the time period. I did all the drawings in the book at 1/4 scale, so they were very small and I often had to use a magnifying glass to help me see what I was drawing. After I finished this drawing I continued to rewrite, and for various reasons I realized that I needed to move this scene from the camera shop to the French Film Academy, which meant that I had to cut this picture. I tried really hard to find ANOTHER moment when I could have Etienne in a camera shop, but, as painful as it was, I knew the picture had to go. I'm glad to see it up on the Amazon website because otherwise no one would have ever seen all those tiny cameras I researched and drew so carefully! </p><p> <i>--Brian Selznick</i> </p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <b>More from Brian Selznick</b> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br><i>The Houdini Box</i> </p></td> <td> <p><br><i>Walt Whitman: Words for America</i> </p></td> <td><br><i>The Boy of a Thousand Faces</i> </td></tr></tbody></table>Brian Selznick is the Caldecott Medal-winning creator of the New York Times bestsellers <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i>, adapted into Martin Scorsese&#x2019;s Oscar-winning <i>Hugo</i>, Todd Haynes's <i>Wonderstruck</i>, and <i>The Marvels</i>.

Rescued from despair by his close friend Renzi, Kydd finds life increasingly difficult when he is framed and dismissed from his ship. The pair eke out a pitiful existence in Guernsey, where, in a moment of desperation, Renzi offers his services to the Prince de Bouillon and becomes embroiled in covert operations. Meanwhile, Kydd accepts the captaincy of a privateer and is soon taking many prizes. Kydd longs to rejoin his rightful place in the navy, however, and when he gets his chance, he risks all for revenge and restoration.</p><p>During the location research for this book, set in the Channel Islands, between France and England, I developed a fresh admiration for Admiral Sir James Saumarez, a much-undervalued naval hero, whose integrity and sensitivity ensured he would stand in the shadow of other, more colourful characters. The inhabitants of the Norman Isles are fiercely independent and rightly revere their 1000-year history. There have been few of my research locations that have proved so little changed and so atmospheric. I do hope you enjoy this story; in the next book Kydd will be sailing into shoal waters of quite another kind...Julian Stockwin is a retired lieutenant commander of the Royal Navy Reserve.

Winds whipped my horse&#x2019;s mane and made my poncho hood flap.<br> <br>But I still heard breaths.<br> <br>The tiny hairs on my nape rose. My mare snorted, her ears pricked forward. I didn&#x2019;t have Lark&#x2019;s animal keenness or the senses of a huntress like Selena, but I could feel someone&#x2014;or something&#x2014;watching me.<br> <br>Stalking me?<br> <br>Inhale exhale<br> <br>I rode harder, pushing myself, pushing my staggering horse, forcing her to navigate the rocky terrain faster than was safe.<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t slept since fleeing Death&#x2019;s lair days ago&#x2014;if you could call them &#x201c;days&#x201d; in this never-ending darkness.

That&#x2019;s better,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d murmured as he&#x2019;d removed my clothes. &#x201c;Just let me see you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. touch you.&#x201d; With his supernatural strength, he must have taken pains not to rip the lace of my panties.<br> <br>When I lay naked before him, his amber eyes had glittered like stars. Pinpoints of light had mesmerized me. &#x201c;So lovely, siev&#x101;. My gods, you humble me.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d given me one of his rare unguarded smiles. &#x201c;This is joy I feel, is it not?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d wanted to sob.<br> <br>Blink. Blink. Blink.<br> <br>I shook my head hard. I needed to pay attention. I couldn&#x2019;t afford to get lost in memories. To get lost at all.<br> <br>When I&#x2019;d readied a bug-out bag and my gear in a panic, Matthew had telepathically directed me: &#x2014;Follow the rushing water upstream into slaver territory. Find the soot valley, then travel its length. If you reach the mass gravesite, you&#x2019;ve gone too far. Ascend the next mountain to the stone forest.&#x2014;<br> <br>Yet since then, he hadn&#x2019;t answered any of my calls.<br> <br>I reached the end of a soot-filled valley and started the climb. Rain began to pour.<br> <br>Minutes? hours? days? passed. Despite the threat I&#x2019;d sensed, I could barely stay awake. My head kept dipping. Maybe I could close my eyes&#x2014;just for a second. I dropped forward, resting my cheek against the horse&#x2019;s mane, an arm on either side of her neck.<br> <br>My lids slid shut.<br> <br><br> <br>When I opened them, I was at Haven.<br> <br>The mare was gone. No rain, no winds. The sky was star-strewn black. All around me, that eerie A.F. silence.<br> <br>Matthew, am I in one of your visions? Every detail felt so real. Bitter ash tinged my tongue. The scent of scorched oaks and sugarcane stung my nose. In the distance, Haven House was a blackened ruin. My mother&#x2019;s funeral pyre.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d burned her body and our home.<br> <br>Jack had secretly helped her die. I understood why. I didn&#x2019;t accept how. I couldn&#x2019;t reconcile after.<br> <br>How many lies he&#x2019;d told.<br> <br>Grief ripped through me, for my mother, for our life before the Flash. My new existence was so brutal and visceral, I wondered if my pre-apocalypse memories were actually a soft and hazy dream.<br> <br>What was real? Unreal?<br> <br>Though Matthew had looked away when my mom had died, he could still access scenes from the past. Was he giving me the memory of her death?<br> <br>A breeze feathered over the ash on the ground, the sound beautiful&#x2014;like sighing. I heard my mother&#x2019;s faint voice telling Jack, &#x201c;Use the pillow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>No, Matthew! I&#x2019;m not ready to see this! Not ready&#x2014;<br> <br>A wolf&#x2019;s howl pierced the night.<br> <br><br> <br>I jolted awake in the saddle. The rain had dwindled to a foggy drizzle. How long had I been out?<br> <br>I rubbed my gritty eyes. Almost screamed. I was surrounded by shadowy figures.<br> <br>Wait, not figures. All around me were towering stacks of rocks, placed like logs for a bonfire. There were so many stacks the area resembled a forest. The stone forest.<br> <br>Who would waste calories to assemble these? And why did I find them so chilling?<br> <br>Matthew, are you there?<br> <br>At last, I felt his presence in my mind! &#x2014;Empress!&#x2014;<br> <br>Has Violet joined her brother yet?<br> <br>&#x2014;The Violet is not there.&#x2014;<br> <br>Oh, thank God.<br> <br>&#x2014;Soon.&#x2014;<br> <br>Shit! You told me Vincent camped within days of Death&#x2019;s castle. I&#x2019;ve ridden for DAYS.<br> <br>&#x2014;Arcana all around.&#x2014;<br> <br>I heard their calls, as if from a sound-out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x2014;Eyes to the skies, lads!&#x2014; Joules.<br> <br>&#x2014;Trapped in the palm of my hand.&#x2014; Tess.<br> <br>&#x2014;I watch you like a hawk.&#x2014; Gabriel.<br> <br>&#x2014;Behold the Bringer of Doubt!&#x2014; Selena.<br> <br>&#x2014;Don&#x2019;t look at this hand, look at that one.&#x2014; Finn.<br> <br>&#x2014;Crazy like a fox.&#x2014; Matthew.<br> <br>&#x2014;We will love you. In our own way.&#x2014; The Lovers.<br> <br>So many Arcana were close. Which meant I was close.<br> <br>&#x2014;Terror from the abyss!&#x2014; Huh?<br> <br>Before I could ask about the new call, my sense of being watched returned. I jerked my head around.<br> <br>&#x2014;Empress, you&#x2019;re one stone forest and one clearing away. Some&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. obstacles between us.&#x2014;<br> <br>Movement. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a man skulking from one stack of rocks to the next.<br> <br>Another man loped to join the first. The armed pair wore fatigues and creepy night-vision goggles. Soldiers of the Lovers&#x2019; army?<br> <br>The stones were for cover, staged as if for a paint-ball course! How long had those men been lying here in wait?<br> <br>Matthew, I&#x2019;m in trouble! I slapped the reins against the mare. She whinnied a protest, but increased her speed. Chest heaving, she wound around the stacks.<br> <br>I craned my head back. Two soldiers had become ten, all with rifles at the ready. Now they walked in plain view. Because I was already surrounded?<br> <br>As the ground began to flatten, those stacks grew fewer. I raised my hand above my eyes, straining to see. Ahead&#x2014;the clearing Matthew had spoken of!<br> <br>My face fell. With no vegetation, it was a quagmire, water and muck pooling in huge craters.<br> <br>Past that, a wall towered, must be thirty feet high. What lay behind it?<br> <br>A shot rang out; a bullet whizzed by my head. My mount fled from the sound. &#x201c;Go, GO!&#x201d;<br> <br>In my panic, my nails morphed into thorn claws. The razor-sharp edges sliced through the fingers of my gloves. My glyphs stirred, moving over my skin.<br> <br>A second gunshot. The near-miss bullet pitted the mud beside the horse&#x2019;s hooves. She shrieked, trotting faster.<br> <br>The shooters missed on purpose. They would want me&#x2014;and the horse&#x2014;alive.<br> <br>Women and horses were two valuable A.F. commodities.<br> <br>Desperate for safety, I squinted at the wall. Men guarded a brightly lit gate.<br> <br>&#x2014;Head there, Empress.&#x2014;<br> <br>My mare would have to slog through the clearing. It was like a moat fronting that wall. The soldiers would catch me long before then.<br> <br>A bright color drew my attention. Attached to a post was a handcrafted sign emblazoned with a red skull and crossbones&#x2014;along with the warning: DANGER! MINES!<br> <br>And that explained the craters.<br> <br>Are you kidding, Matthew? Soldiers trailing me; mines ahead. How do I get past a minefield?<br> <br>An agonized yell sounded behind me.<br> <br>I dared a glance back. Only nine soldiers followed. They ran toward me at a faster clip. The ones at the edges aimed their guns&#x2014;off to their sides.<br> <br>Another horrified yell.<br> <br>And another.<br> <br>Open gunfire erupted. Muzzle flashes warred with fog; I couldn&#x2019;t make out anything.<br> <br>I turned forward. Screamed.<br> <br>Three soldiers stood before me, rifles trained on my face. The mare reared, punching hooves at them.<br> <br>The other gunmen had been pushing me toward these!<br> <br>Yet behind them, a black beast melded with shadow. One brilliant golden eye gleamed like a lantern.<br> <br>Cyclops! Had Lark sent her one-eyed wolf to protect me?<br> <br>Baring dagger-size fangs, the massive beast gave a spine-chilling snarl. The men twisted around&#x2014;<br> <br>Cyclops launched himself at the panic-stricken soldiers, knocking them to the ground. His mighty jaws clamped down on limbs and rifles, snapping through bone and metal.<br> <br>Body parts sailed into the air. Blood spurted like a mall fountain. I winced, though I should be used to seeing stuff like this.<br> <br>The wolf lifted his head from the carnage and growled at the stupefied soldiers positioned behind me. Those bastards had driven me into a trap; Cyclops ate the trap.<br> <br>Faced with the beast&#x2019;s dripping maw, they fled headlong.<br> <br>For me, Cyclops wagged his scarred tail. &#x201c;Good damn wolf. Good boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matthew said: &#x2014;Ride for the fort! You have to make it to the wall.&#x2014;<br> <br>What&#x2019;s behind the wall? For all I knew, Matthew was sending me into the Milovn�cis&#x2019; camp.<br> <br>&#x2014;RIDE!&#x2014;<br> <br>Into mines? We&#x2019;re going to get blown away! Forget my self-healing powers; I couldn&#x2019;t regenerate from decapitation.<br> <br>&#x2014;Go left.&#x2014;<br> <br>Directing me around the danger?<br> <br>I turned to Cyclops. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if you can understand me, or if Lark is steering her familiar. But follow my mount carefully unless you want to regrow limbs.&#x201d; He was still limping from our battle with the Devil Card.<br> <br>He chuffed, and bubbles of blood formed over his snout. With a swish of his tail, he defiantly snapped up a dismembered arm, carrying it like a chew toy. But he did move behind me.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m trusting you, Matthew. I swallowed and guided my horse left.<br> <br>&#x2014;MY left!&#x2014;<br> <br>Quick correction. Cyclops followed.<br> <br>&#x2014;Faster, Empress. Or the Azey will figure out our mine moat maze.&#x2014;<br> <br>Your what? Who are the Azey?<br> <br>&#x2014;A.S.E. Army of the Southeast. Go right for three seconds. Then left.&#x2014;<br> <br>Holding my breath, I slapped the reins yet again. One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three. I tugged the reins to my right.<br> <br>&#x2014;Faster!&#x2014;<br> <br>Soon I was galloping through a minefield, a telepathic Arcana in my mind and a giant wolf at my heels.<br> <br>I could hear those same wet breaths. The wolf had been following me! If I lived through this night, I was so going to owe Lark.<br> <br>The gate creaked open ahead. I spurred the mare, racing to reach the fort.<br> <br>With no idea what awaited me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><h2>Chinese Poetry, 2nd ed., Revised: An Anthology of Major Modes and Genres</h2><p>This is the first paperback edition of a classic anthology of Chinese poetry. Spanning two thousand years&#x2014;from the <i>Book of Songs</i> (circa 600 B.C.) to the <i>ch�</i> form of the Yuan Dynasty (1260&#x2013;1368)&#x2014;these 150 poems cover all major genres that students of Chinese poetry must learn. <br>Newly designed, the unique format of this volume will enhance its reputation as the definitive introduction to Chinese poetry, while its introductory essay on issues of Chinese aesthetics will continue to be an essential text on the problems of translating such works into English. Each poem is printed with the original Chinese characters in calligraphic form, coordinated with word-for-word annotations, and followed by an English translation. Correcting more than a century of distortion of the classical Chinese by translators unconcerned with the intricacies and aesthetics of the Chinese language, these masterful translations by Wai-lim Yip, a noted and honored translator and scholar, allow English readers to enter more easily into the dynamic of the original poems. Each section of the volume is introduced by a short essay on the mode or genre of poem about to be presented and is followed by a comprehensive bibliography. <p></p><p></p></p><p>&#34;For three decades now, Wai-lim Yip has been a linking figure between American modernism (in-the-line-of-Pound) and Chinese traditions and practices form which that modernism has long drawn. His two classic American works--in the lovely way that classic, as a word and concept, can still resonate in Chinese context--are his Pound&#39;s Cathay and Chinese Poetry.&#34;--Jerome Rothenberg, from the introduction to &#34;Between Landscapes: Poems by Wai-lim Yip&#34;<p>Wai-lim Yip has been Professor of Literature at the University of California at San Diego for the past 30 years. A bi-cultural poet, translator, critic, and theorist, Yip has written more than 40 books in two languages. His works of poetry include Fugue, Crossing, Edge of Waking, Thirty Years of Poetry, Between Landscapes, and The Voice of Blooming. Yip&#x2019;s scholarly works include Ezra Pound&#x2019;s Cathay, Reading the Modern and the Postmodern, Chinese Poetics, and Diffusion of Distances: Dialogues between Chinese and Western Poetics. His translations include Modern Chinese Poetry 1955&#x2013;1965, Lyrics from Shelters: Modern Chinese Poetry, 1930&#x2013;1950, and Hiding the Universe: Poems of Wang Wei. He has been honored as one of the main figures of modern Chinese literary and cultural theory in Beijing and Taiwan and was awarded recognition in Taiwan as one of the &#x201c;Ten Major Modern Chinese Poets.&#x201d; <br></p></p><h2>Here Comes Everybody: An Introduction to James Joyce for The Ordinary Reader</h2><p>"My book does not pretend to scholarship, only to a desire to help the average reader who sees all his works available in paperback and is scared more of their content then their price. The appearance of difficulty is part of Joyce&#x2019;s big joke; the profundities are usually expressed in good round Dublin terms; Joyce&#x2019;s heroes are humble men. If there was ever a writer for the people, Joyce was that writer. But there is a need for the kind of pilot-commentary I attempt to provide. After nearly fifty years of reading Joyce it seems only right that I should pass on what I have learned of his methods to those who come fresh to his riches.&#x201d;<br><br>Anthony Burgess&#x2019;s own foreword to his work on Joyce establishes the purpose and the tone of his study. Vigorous, humorous and perceptive, his commentary is an excellent introduction and a valuable companion to the reading of Joyce.</p><p>Anthony Burgess( 1917-1993), English novelist, critic, was a man of letters whose fictional explorations of modern dilemmas combine wit, moral earnestness, and a note of the bizarre.&#x201c;This is the best study of Joyce that I have ever read &#x2013; good-humoured and modest, learned but full of considered enthusiasm [...] Mr Burgess has written a brilliant and humane study of the most brilliant and humane of twentieth-century novelists&#x201d;. <b>- Philip Toynbee in the Observer</b></p><h2>A Black Women&#39;s Civil War Memoirs</h2><p>&#34;These are the memoirs of a black woman who was born a slave, who had the good fortune to gain her freedom early in the war, with the education and ability to observe and the will to recall in later years the significance of the events in which she was a vigorous participant. Susie King Taylor&#39;s recollections are invaluable for those who wish to understand the Civil War from the black woman&#39;s point of view. ... A treasure in the light of today&#39;s feminist movement.&#34; (from the Introduction by Willie Lee Rose)</p><p>Taylor was born a slave, gained her freedom early in the Civil War, and served as a nurse for the first black regiment of the Union Army. Her disappointing, fairly random recollections cover her flight to freedom in 1862, her regiment's expeditions along the Southeastern coast, the end of the war and, briefly, Reconstruction. The author does not demonstrate a capacity for observation and reflection or the descriptive skills necessary to bring her experiences to life for the reader. Of such a momentous occasion as the first time she heard the Emancipation Proclamation, her most significant comment is: "It was a glorious day for us all, and we enjoyed every minute of it." She also makes little mention of her personal life, including her two marriages and the death of a son. In her reflections on the condition of blacks in 1902, the year the memoirs were originally privately published, Taylor's writing is at its strongest and most vivid as she decries the betrayal of the freedom and equality blacks and whites had fought for in the Civil War. Included here are excellent, illuminating footnotes by Romero, a research fellow at Johns Hopkins University. Containing historical facts and analysis and quotes from other Civil War memoirs, they supply not only the historical context, but also some of the human drama that Taylor's offering lacks.

In this first installment of his Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Freedom from Fear</em>, Kennedy tells how America endured, and eventually prevailed, in the face of that unprecedented calamity.<br><br>Kennedy vividly demonstrates that the economic crisis of the 1930s was more than a reaction to the excesses of the 1920s. For more than a century before the Crash, America's unbridled industrial revolution had gyrated through repeated boom and bust cycles, consuming capital and inflicting misery on city and countryside alike. Nor was the alleged prosperity of the 1920s as uniformly shared as legend portrays. Countless Americans eked out threadbare lives on the margins of national life.<br><br>Roosevelt's New Deal wrenched opportunity from the trauma of the 1930s and created a lasting legacy of economic and social reform, but it was afflicted with shortcomings and contradictions as well. With an even hand Kennedy details the New Deal's problems and defeats, as well as its achievements. He also sheds fresh light on its incandescent but enigmatic author, Franklin D.

In addition to embarrassing prominent individuals caught up, wittingly or unwittingly, in the secret superpower struggle for hearts and minds, the revelations of 1967 were one of the worst operational disasters in the history of American intelligence and presaged a series of public scandals from which the CIA's reputation has arguably never recovered.</p><p>CIA official Frank Wisner called the operation his "mighty Wurlitzer," on which he could play any propaganda tune. In this illuminating book, Hugh Wilford provides the first comprehensive account of the clandestine relationship between the CIA and its front organizations. Using an unprecedented wealth of sources, he traces the rise and fall of America's Cold War front network from its origins in the 1940s to its Third World expansion during the 1950s and ultimate collapse in the 1960s.</p><p>Covering the intelligence officers who masterminded the CIA's fronts as well as the involved citizen groups--�migr�s, labor, intellectuals, artists, students, women, Catholics, African Americans, and journalists--Wilford provides a surprising analysis of Cold War society that contains valuable lessons for our own age of global conflict.</p></p><p>Hugh Wilford is Associate Professor of History at California State University, Long Beach.<p>Reviewed by Michael Kazin</p><p>What do Richard Wright, Gloria Steinem, Henry Kissinger, George Meany, Nina Simone and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. have in common?</p><p>Answer: Directly or indirectly, they all took money from the Central Intelligence Agency during the early years of the Cold War. </p><p>If nothing else, this little quiz illuminates a side of history overshadowed by familiar tales about the CIA's plots to overthrow governments and its cocksure reports about non-existent WMDs. In the 1950s and early '60s, U.S. policymakers feared that the Soviet Union and its allies were appealing quite effectively to large numbers of people in Europe and the Third World. The war for the hearts and minds of humanity thus ranked nearly as high as the race to build better missiles and a mightier economy. No part of the government seemed better equipped to lead the propaganda offensive than the CIA. What other agency was stuffed with as many Ivy League graduates who, supposedly, knew as much about literature and the arts as they did about bugging a room and preparing a cigar that would explode in Fidel Castro's face?</p><p>As Hugh Wilford explains in this brisk yet thorough narrative, the CIA took for its model one of the enemy's more successful tactics: the creation and funding of front organizations. Communists had set up the International Labor Defense and the World Peace Congress, so the agency spent millions on organizations with such virtuous names as the Congress for Cultural Freedom, the Independent Research Service and the Free Trade Union Committee. An architect of the plan, veteran spymaster Frank Wisner, was fond of comparing it to a huge organ, "a mighty Wurlitzer" that, as Wilford puts it, would be "capable of playing any propaganda tune he desired." Few of the rank-and-file Americans active in these groups suspected that CIA officials were meeting routinely with their leaders and paying most of the bills. </p><p>Wilford devotes a good deal of energy to uncovering internal conflicts among the CIA's witting and unwitting beneficiaries. Jay Lovestone, the agency's main conduit to organized labor, was a former leader of the American Communist Party who sought to deny funds to fellow unionists such as the Reuther brothers, Walter and Victor, whom he judged too soft on the totalitarian threat. Writers and artists indulged in endless squabbles and fits of temperament, frustrating CIA officials who tried to control them. A South American tour by Robert Lowell had to be cut short, Wilford recounts, when the poet "threw away the pills for his manic depression, stripped naked, and mounted an equestrian statue in one of the main squares of Buenos Aires, declaring himself to be 'Caesar of Argentina' and his [CIA] minder one of his generals." </p><p>Wilford, who was educated in Britain and teaches history at California State University Long Beach, is hardly the first author to tell such tales. But no one has written a more comprehensive or sophisticated account of the pro-American fronts from their creation in the late 1940s to the investigative report 20 years later in Ramparts magazine that first exposed the CIA's cultural offensive and left people such as Steinem with a bit of explaining to do. At age 25 in 1959, Steinem took part in a CIA-funded effort to disrupt a communist youth festival in Vienna. Other participants in that effort included a youthful Zbigniew Brzezinski and future Washington Post reporter Walter Pincus, who unfurled a protest banner from a building overlooking the festival's closing ceremonies, then made their getaway over a plank to an adjoining rooftop and melted into the night. Pincus has said he paid his own way to Austria and was unaware of the CIA's involvement at the time, while Steinem has said that, in her experience, the CIA "was completely different from its image; it was liberal, nonviolent, and honorable."</p><p>Aside from an irritating habit of sprinkling his paragraphs with acronyms, Wilford writes with smoothness and wit. The book's title is intended to be ironic: Frank Wisner's musical metaphor was both grandiose and inaccurate. Few of the CIA fronts reliably behaved as the agency desired. Many of the subsidized individuals and groups had a moderately leftist inclination; they were determined to fight communism in their own ways and resisted direction from above. </p><p>In the late 1950s, for example, Richard Wright was eager to counter the Soviet propaganda effort at international gatherings of black intellectuals and artists. His own unhappy stint in the Communist Party during the 1930s had turned him into a fierce anti-communist. But he came to believe that the American Society for African Culture, a black front group that the CIA secretly funded, was not a trustworthy friend of the newly independent nations and people on the mother continent. "I lift my hand to fight Communism and I find that the hand of the Western world is sticking knives into my back," Wright complained shortly before his death in 1960. </p><p>In the end, the agency's elaborate program operated more like a creaky karaoke machine than a majestic cathedral organ. Its American clients were glad to sing along -- but in their own key, often substituting their own lyrics. Even at the height of the Cold War, our government discovered it couldn't "play" unruly, pluralistic, opinionated citizens raised on the First Amendment as if they were a disciplined Stalinist cadre. That should be a welcome conclusion. </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

These highly collectible editions of the original 24 adventures will delight Tintin fans old and new. Perfect for lovers of graphic novels, mysteries and historical adventures. The world&#39;s most famous travelling reporter discovers that Professor Calculus is building a space rocket. Tintin and Captain Haddock are amazed to find that Professor Calculus is planning a top-secret project from the Sprodj Atomic Research Centre in Syldavia. And before our intrepid hero knows it, the next stop on this adventure is ...Space. The Adventures of Tintin are among the best books for readers aged 8 and up. Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907. Over the course of 54 years he completed over 20 titles in The Adventures of Tintin series, which is now considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics series of all time. Have you collected all 24 graphic novel adventures?

It turns out that the professor has joined a consortium in order to build a rocket that will land a person on the moon (this was in 1953, well before Neil Armstrong). Unfortunately, the project has attracted some unwanted attention from those who will resort to sabotage and skullduggery to steal the technology. Is the project successful? Well, it's probably not that great of a spoiler to reveal that the story is continued in <i>Explorers on the Moon</i>. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907. Over the course of 54 years he completed 23 albums of The Adventures of Tintin series, which is now considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics series of all time. With translations published in over 80 languages, more than 230 million copies sold worldwide and a Hollywood movie to its name, Tintin dominates the Comics and Graphic Novels chart even today. Sadly, Herge died in 1983, leaving his 24th album, Tintin and Alph-Art, unfinished, but his hero continues to be one of the most iconic characters in both adult and children&#39;s fiction.</p><h2>West Side Story</h2><p><b>From the silver screen to the Great White Way&#x2014;one of the greatest stories of all time.</b><br><br>They came together through love but violence threatened to tear them apart.

This is a grim statistic but hundreds of millions of people are breaking free from poverty with the help of grass-roots programs and organizations funded by regular people her</p><p><p>"We have an opportunity, in this generation, to reduce global poverty, both through acts of charity and by working as citizens to influence public policy. Stephen Smith offers reliable information, stories of success, and good advice on how to get personally involved in this important fight. Read it, and then take action. " --David Beckmann, President, Bread for the World </p><p>"This practical and remarkably hopeful guide to ending world poverty delivers what it promises, clear-headed remedies for heart-breaking conditions. Stephen Smith finds solutions where others see only problems. All who truly place moral values at the top of their agendas will want to read this book. "--Forrest Church, author of <i>The American Creed and Freedom from Fear</i></p><p>"A most comprehensive strategy for fighting poverty-of great interest to activists, scholars, and all who care about those most in need. Clearly writen and with much convinction."--Amitai Etzioni, author of <i>From Empire to Community: A New Approach to International Relations</i></p><p>"Smith's book is a terrific contribution to our understanding of how to improve the well-being of impoverished people. It is accessible and informative for anyone who is interested in understanding clearly the fundamental causes of chronic poverty, and the innovative responses by organizations worldwide to address them. Smith's discussion of the keys to poverty traps dispels many popular misconceptions, and helps the reader understand the real issues. His profiles of successful programs designed to address those traps shows the impact many organizations have already made worldwide, and highlights some of the lessons they have learned in the process. This book should help raise the effectiveness of donors, organizations, and governments in their efforts to help those in need." --Judith M. Dean, International Economist, Washington, DC; former Associate Professor of Economics, SAIS, Johns Hopkins University, and former Board member, World Relief.</p><p>"Anyone who seeks a better understanding of human poverty should read this book. It provides a rich set of anti-poverty initiatives and programs, ranging from playpumps in South Africa to phone ladies in Bangladesh. The author's optimism is a welcome antidote against the skepticism, pessimism and cynicism that often characterizes the debate on global poverty. In readable language, he describes the many faces of human poverty and unbundles its complexities at the hand of concrete stories and practical approaches. He also offers a guide for those in rich countries who want to make a difference by supporting aid and relief organizations." --Jan Vandemoortele, Leader, Poverty Group, United Nations Development Program</p><p>"The world's leaders have repeatedly promised to tackle poverty on a massive scale, but they always seem to find excuses for failing to mobilize the necessary resources. Stephen Smith shows convincingly that even the poorest of the poor can help themselves - with a little help from the rest of us. Anyone who wants to understand why so many remain trapped in poverty, and what they and we can do about it, should read this inspiring book." --Ann Florini, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and Director of the World Economic Forum's Global Governance Initiative</p><p>"Get this book. Read it. Step up. Amid a million reasons to shrink away in frustration, Stephen Smith offers a clear and engaging guide to meeting the greatest challenge of our time. The book is much more than a call to arms. Smith sifts through the latest research and reports on practical innovations that he has witnessed around the world--new ideas that are already in place and working. The book, by a leading voice in development economics, offers simple steps, small and large, to push the fight forward."--Jonathan Morduch, NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, and co-author of <i>The Economics of Microfinance</i></p><p>"Offers sensible guidelines to both individuals and corporations about how they can help, but its main contribution is to describe the successes of many programs on the ground, ranging from programs to improve nutrition to those working on education or microcredit, often run by local nongovernmental organizations, which have emerged to fill the gaps left by incompetent or corrupt governments." -<i>Foreign Affairs</i></p><p>"A straightforward and accessible book on the causes of poverty and some successful programs for reducing it. Ending Global Poverty (Palgrave), in fact, takes as its starting point the fact that pockets of intense poverty can persist even within growing economies because of self-reinforcing "traps" such as illiteracy, overpopulation and a lack of working capital. Smith reports on a number of successful programs that have helped desperately poor communities overcome those traps. He emphasizes micro-projects that rely on the commitment, ingenuity and hard work of poor people themselves. The book is part of a growing literature that questions the top-down approach taken by the United Nations, World Bank and regional development banks to alleviate poverty through major infrastructure projects, deregulation and reform of national economic institutions. Smith advocates a bottom-up approach that focuses on community efforts and relies on the generosity and involvement of individuals and non-government organizations." -<i>Washington Post</i></p>Stephen C.

She discovered--rediscovered--a way open to anyone who wants sanctity. The way is simple: the path of complete trust, a child's trust in a loving Parent. She called her path the "little way" and anchored it in the word of God. Simple but not easy, the "little way" challenges our notions of sanctity as personal achievement, as strength of character, as undeviating fulfillment of laws and rules. It roots us in the sanctity of reality--the here and now, in ordinary life, lived under the providence of God.</p><p></p><h2>Complete Richard Hannay</h2><p>Contains: The Thirty-Nine Steps, Greenmantle, Mr Standfast, The Three Hostages and The Island of Sheep</p><p>John Buchan (1875-1940) was born in Perth, Scotland and educated at Oxford where he published five books and won several awards, including one for poetry.

The book is organized into sections, such as artists, fur traders, and Civil War generals, which feature biographies of individuals. Besides being a history of a significant place, this book functions as a guidebook to St. Louis and its notable residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because so many of St. Louis&#x2019;s leading citizens (such as William Clark, James Buchanan Eads, Susan Blow, and Adolphus Busch) are buried in Bellefontaine, the book is a tale of the city. Cemetery records and interviews with such insiders as the cemetery&#x2019;s superintendent and gatekeeper inform the research. The contributions and controversies that make up St. Louis history are revealed, and the architecture and landscape of the cemetery are celebrated as significant to the region.<br></p><p><b>Carol Ferring Shepley</b>, who is based in St. Louis, has written for <i>Money Magazine</i>, <i>Time</i>, and <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</i>.

Speaking to an audience of Western students, the Dalai Lama shows us how to apply basic Buddhist principles to our day-to-day lives. Starting with the very foundation of Buddhism, the Four Noble Truths, he provides the framework for understanding the Buddha&#x2019;s first teachings on suffering, happiness, and peace. He follows with commentary on two of Buddhism&#x2019;s most profound texts: The Eight Verses on Training the Mind and Atisha&#x2019;s Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment, often referring to the former as one of his main sources of inspiration for the practice of compassion. With clear, accessible language and the familiar sense of humor that infuses nearly all of his work, the Dalai Lama invites us all to develop innermost awareness, a proper understanding of the nature of reality, and heartfelt compassion for all beings.<br><br>This book was previously published under the title Lighting the Way.</p><p>HIS HOLINESS THE FOURTEENTH DALAI LAMA is considered the foremost Buddhist leader of our time.

Walker and Maurice Greiffenhagen Unusually for Dickens, Hard Times is set, not in London, but in the imaginary mid-Victorian Northern industrial town of Coketown with its blackened factories, downtrodden workers and polluted environment. This is the soulless domain of the strict utilitarian Thomas Gradgrind and the heartless factory owner Josiah Bounderby. However human joy is not excluded thanks to &#39;Mr Sleary&#39;s Horse-Riding&#39; circus, a gin-soaked and hilarious troupe of open-hearted and affectionate people who act as an antidote to all the drudgery and misery endured by the ordinary citizens of Coketown.</p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

A. Schwaller de Lubicz to the monuments, ruins, statues, and bas-reliefs of the temples of Karnak. With nearly 600 photographs by Georges and Valentine de Mire, more than 450 of which are full-page plates, this volume is the only complete photographic record of this important historic site. Because of recent vandalism many of the artifacts are no longer intact, and it is no longer possible to see many of the details captured in these images. <br>This promenade through the temples of Karnak reveals the remains of a world devoted to an unimpeachable faith in the afterlife, a faith whose conviction seems to have exalted its builders and artists, as was the case for several brief centuries with those who constructed the cathedrals of the Middle Ages. One did not work at fashioning these stones, nor were these works sculpted under someone's strict authority; here it was necessary to act out of the heart. Every gesture in the depictions, every arrangement in the buildings, is a hieroglyph from the symbolic language of the sages who spoke to spirit and consciousness.</p><p>R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz (1897-1961) was one of the most important esoteric philosophers of this century. His elucidation of the temple at Luxor and his presentation of the Egyptian understanding of a special quality of consciousness--the innate intelligence of the heart--form a bridge that links the sacred science of the ancients to the possibility of rediscovering that science in our own time. His other books include <i>The Egyptian Miracle</i>, <i>Esoterism and Symbol</i>, <i>Nature Word</i>, <i>Sacred Science</i>, <i>A Study of Numbers</i>, <i>Symbol and the Symbolic</i>, <i>The Temple in Man</i>, and his classic two-volume masterwork <i>The Temple of Man</i>.R.

Critically praised for his finely modeled and classically composed photographs, Robert Mapplethorpe remains intensely controversial and enormously popular. This book brings together almost 300 images from the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation&#x2019;s archive and private collections to provide a critical view of Mapplethorpe&#x2019;s formative years as an artist, revealing the themes that would inspire Mapplethorpe throughout his career. Included is a selection of color Polaroids and objects incorporating his early &#x201c;instant&#x201d; photography. Some images convey a disarming tenderness and vulnerability, others a toughness and immediacy that would give way in later years to more classical form. The author traces the development of Mapplethorpe&#x2019;s use of instant photography over a period of five years, from 1970 to 1975, when the artist worked mainly in this medium. The images include self-portraits; figure studies; still lifes; portraits of lovers and friends such as Patti Smith, Sam Wagstaff, and Marianne Faithful; and observations of everyday objects. Marked by a spontaneity and creative curiosity, these fragile images offer an illuminating contrast to the glossy perfection of the work for which Mapplethorpe is best known, allowing us a more personal glimpse of his artistry.</p><p>Robert Mapplethorpe&#x2019;s black-and-white Polaroid photographs of the 1970s&#x2015;a medium in which he established the style that would bring him international acclaim&#x2015;are brought together in this new paperback edition.

McClain is professor of history at Brown University and the award-winning author of Kamazawa: A Seventeenth Century Castle Town. He and his family live in Providence, Rhode Island.McClain takes a multifaceted, nuanced look at Japan's last four centuries. A professor of history at Brown University, McClain begins with the investiture of Tokugawa Ieyasu as shogun in 1603, then leads the reader from daimyo castles of the 17th and 18th centuries to the filthy barracks of mine workers in the 19th century, to the refined, "cultured houses" of the emerging urban middle class in the 20th century. Equally adept at describing religious and intellectual currents, economic development, political maneuverings and the special problems faced by women and marginalized groups like Koreans and the Ainu, McClain draws on the most current studies of Japanese history. Throughout, he is evenhanded in his choice of subject matter and source. He acknowledges the contributions of the industrial giants, but gives voice to the rural poor, factory workers and victims of industrial pollution. He describes the geopolitical realities that drove Japan to empire but also unflinchingly details the horrors of war. More than a mere description of how Japan became a leading nation of the 20th century, this is a story with room for the pronouncements of emperors, the poetry of Basho and the demands of labor leaders. A newcomer to the subject may be daunted at first by the sheer volume of information, but McClain soon puts the reader at ease with his mastery of the subject and his clear, precise prose. Some readers may wonder at his decision to overlook events such as the Ako incident in the chapters on the Tokugawa era or Aum Shinrikyo's gassing of the Tokyo subway in his discussion of contemporary Japan, but overall this is a remarkable achievement. 70 illus. not seen by PW. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>When Treatment Fails: How Medicine Cares for Dying Children</h2><p>Medical care of the terminally ill is one of the most emotionally fraught and controversial issues before the public today. As medicine advances and technologies develop, end-of-life care becomes more individualized and uncertain, guided less by science and more by values and beliefs. The crux of the controversy is when to withhold or withdraw curative treatments--when is enough, enough?<br>Political debates rage about when treatment is no longer effective; difficult cases are contested in courts; and the media devour the most sensational aspects of end-of-life care. In all this excitement and controversy, what is sadly overlooked is the extreme pressure that care of the terminally ill puts on medical staff as they deal with patients and their families and make life-or-death decisions. That pressure--the psychological strain and continuing uncertainties--is magnified when the patients are children.<br>David Bearison looks at this controversial issue from the perspective of the medical staff caring for dying children. Not just doctors, but nurses and counselors as well. By capturing their stories--as no other book has, Bearison is able to move beyond broad, abstract ideas about end-of-life care to convey the situated contexts of such care, including the complications, disagreements, frustrations, confusions, and unexpected setbacks.<br>In addition to a discussion of questions surrounding whether to withhold or withdraw curative treatments, <em>When Treatment Fails</em> explores the crucial concerns of those medical practitioners who care for dying children: education and training, relation with one another, communicating with patients and families, and finally, coping and moving on. Ultimately, the threads connecting these themes are the great costs and rewards of this difficult work, and the lessons that can be drawn from the nitty-gritty experiences of medical practitioners who struggle to find the balance between trying to defeat death and trying to provide comfort.<br></p><p><br><strong>David J. Bearison's</strong> many positions include Professor of Developmental Psychology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, Adjunct Professor of Medical Psychology in Pediatrics and Psychiatry at the College of Physician and Surgeons of Columbia University, and Attending at the Children's Hospital of New York (CHONY), Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. He is a member of the American Psychological Association's Task Force on End-of-Life Issues for Children and Adolescents. He lives with his wife, a pediatric oncologist, in New York City and Croton on Hudson, NY.<br><br>"This is a deeply moving, yet masterfully organized book about children dying of fatal diseases--the impact of death on parents, doctors, and nurses. If death is the 'looming terror' of life, a child's death multiplies the terror and attendant sense of loss. There is no 'theory of death,' and Professor Bearison wisely uses narrative accounts to capture the uniqueness of each death and its human impact. What eases the suffering is humane and honest communication between parents and dying kids, but also between parents and medical staff. But as Jessica Mitford once put it, 'Gracious dying is a huge, macabre, and expensive joke on the American people.' This book is required reading for those concerned with the 'management' of the tragic."--Jerome Bruner, University Professor, New York University<p></p><br>"Bearison takes us directly to the bedside of seriously ill and dying children, into the hearts and minds of their parents, and into the struggle to know--and then to do--the right thing as experienced by their nurses and doctors. These stories are the truths behind the miracles of modern medicine from the point of view of its practitioners--truths about the rebirth of hope with each new patient, about the cost of repeatedly witnessing suffering in children and their parents, about how hard it is to stay close enough to remain human but far enough to retain professional boundaries, about guilt and grief and loss when treatment fails, and then about having to get up the next day and do it all over again."--Diane Meier, Director, Lillian and Benjamin Hertzberg Palliative Care Institute; Director, Center to Advance Palliative Care; Catherine Gaisman Professor of Medical Ethics; and Professor, Departments of Geriatrics and Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine<p></p><br>"In presenting clinician narratives, Dr. Bearison succeeds in going well beyond the usual 'sound bite' to give voice to the complexity, challenge, and drama of providing care at the end of life for children and their families. The narratives spare no detail and no emotion. Clinicians of all disciplines and varying levels of experience working with dying children owe it to themselves to read this book. The stories, struggles, strategies, language, ways of coping, and insights revealed by these fellow clinicians are a gift, and one that can teach and guide us all."--Elaine C. Meyer, Ph.D., R.N., Director, Program to Enhance Relational and Communication Skills, Children's Hospital Boston, and Assistant Professor of Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School<p></p><br>"The new book seeks to explore previously uncharted territory: the inner workings of physicians' minds as they wrestle with the deteriorating health--and approaching death--of very ill young patients."--<em>Folio</em><p></p><br>"This book is truly unique in its evaluation of pediatric end-of-life care issues from the medical staff's perspective. It is of high quality and would be useful reading for all medical personnel involved in the care of a dying child."--<em>Doody's</em><p></p><br>"This book is truly unique in its evaluation of pediatric end-of-life care issues from the medical staff's perspective. It is of high quality and would be useful reading for all medical personnel involved in the care of a dying child."--<em>Doody's</em><p></p><br>"...rich, searingly honest, self-disclosing, compelling, occasionally harrowing, and always thought-provoking. There are some beautiful and moving statements, especially from nurses, and some marvelous words of wisdom from attending physicians...It is the dispassionate reporting of the sheer complexity of conflicting issues, aspirations, and judgments about what is considered best for a particular patient and family in a particular situation that will ensure the lasting value of this book, particularly as a resource for discussion, workshops, and team-building within pediatric hematology / oncology units."--Michael M. Stevens, Fellow, Royal Australasian College of Physicians (Pediatrics), Senior Staff Specialist and Attending, Oncology Unit, The Children's Hospital at Westmead in Sydney, Australia<p></p><br>"This is a wonderful book written in a unique style. The author has managed to capture, by using actual events, the essence of the problems facing those who are taking care of children for whom treatments have failed and are slowly dying. I cant remember ever reading a book on this subject, which contains so much clear thinking, wisdom and no jargon!...[T]his book is really one that all young physicians in training should be required to read. Actually, it neednt be required as Id predict that if you read a few pages, you would realize what a great book it is."--<em>Pediatrics</em><p></p><br>"The book offers a remarkable treasure trove of lived experiences of clinicians from which novice and seasoned clinicians may learn and deepen their insight about end-of-life care of children."--<em>JAMA</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Casebook on the Men in Black</h2><p>Who are the Men in Black? In recent years they have tried to silence witnesses of UFO sightings with threats, harassment and worse. Are they government agents? Aliens? Creatures from another dimension? In Casebook on the Men in Black, Keith traces the path of these unusual visitors through history, and presents startling evidence about their origin and purpose.</p><p>Jim Keith (d.1999) was a well-known conspiracy and UFO writer of 1980s and 1990s. He was the editor of the magazine Dharma Combat: The Magazine of Spirituality, Reality and Other Conspiracies for many years and the author of over a dozen books, many of them published by Adventures Unlimited Press, including Mind Control, World Control, Saucers of the Illuminati, Mass Control, Mind Control and UFOs, and others. Originally from Los Angeles, he lived in briefly in Klamath Falls, OR until finally settling in Reno.From the early days of European Witchery to modern day Ufology, Men In Black incidents have straddled the realms of mysticism and science, fantasy and reality. Since ancient times these mysterious beings have stalked the planet. Often seen at the scene of UFO sightings, these "beings" (dressed entirely in black) harass witnesses in an attempt to silence them. They intimidate those involved, confiscate videos and photographs, and snatch physical evidence. Are they simply government agents sent to threaten and confuse? Ghostly beings from another dimensions? Aliens? Or perhaps a manifestation of our own subconscious trying to come to terms with an increasingly complex world. Casebook On The Men In Black traces the path of these unusual visitors through history, and presents startling evidence about their origin and purpose.

But in a nation experiencing unprecedented prosperity, even for many families who seem to be doing everything right, this ideal is still out of reach.</p><p>In <i>The Financial Diaries</i>, Jonathan Morduch and Rachel Schneider draw on the groundbreaking U.S. Financial Diaries, which follow the lives of 235 low- and middle-income families as they navigate through a year. Through the Diaries, Morduch and Schneider challenge popular assumptions about how Americans earn, spend, borrow, and save&#x2015;and they identify the true causes of distress and inequality for many working Americans.</p><p>We meet real people, ranging from a casino dealer to a street vendor to a tax preparer, who open up their lives and illustrate a world of financial uncertainty in which even limited financial success requires imaginative&#x2015;and often costly&#x2015;coping strategies. Morduch and Schneider detail what families are doing to help themselves and describe new policies and technologies that will improve stability for those who need it most.</p><p>Combining hard facts with personal stories, <i>The Financial Diaries </i>presents an unparalleled inside look at the economic stresses of today's families and offers powerful, fresh ideas for solving them.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Financial Diaries</i> succeeds in that rarest of goals: making you think and care at the same time.

Employers, financial institutions, and policymakers should read this book and help American families better save, borrow, spend, and plan for their financial future."<b>--Sarah Rosen Wartell, President, Urban Institute</b></p><p>"This powerful book should change the way we think about economic opportunity in America. Two of the nation's leading experts on consumer finance show how widespread and destructive economic instability has become, reaching from factory and fast-food workers into the ranks of the middle class. Rising costs and unsteady income not only strain families&#x2019; efforts to meet basic needs--and generate a heavy reliance on self-defeating coping strategies--but challenge their faith in the American Dream.

I think that the current text is nicely balanced between theory, research, and applications.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x2014; Ross Thompson, University of California Davis</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;The coverage of &nbsp;[chapter 10] is outstanding: Laura has addressed each of the major issues I would expect to find in a chapter concerned with emotional development, temperament, and attachment.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x2014; Ross Thompson, University of California, Davis</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Like all of Laura&#x2019;s writing, [chapter 10] is breathtakingly current.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x2014; Ross Thompson, University of California, Davis</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;One of the challenges of the high level of the Berk texts is to make them accessible to students of a range of backgrounds and ability, and I perceive these learning aids [Ask Yourself Questions] as one way of doing so. All of these study aids are thoughtfully conceived and well-designed. &#x201c;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x2014; Ross Thompson, University of California, Davis</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;[Chapter 10] is an extremely comprehensive and well written chapter on Emotional Development.

Nelson, Brigham Young University </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;One real advantage of Berk&#x2019;s text, given that a new edition emerges every 3 years or so, is that she is consistently on top of things.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x2014; David A. Nelson, Brigham Young University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;We [Psychology Faculty at Brigham Young University] conduct a review of potential introductory child development texts on a regular basis.

Set in Dublin during the Lockout of 1913, it is a panoramic novel of city life. It embraces a wide range of social millieux, from the miseries of the tenements to the cultivated, bourgeois Bradshaws. It introduces a memorable cast of characters: the main protagonist, Fitz, a model of the hard-working, loyal and abused trade unionist; the isolated, well-meaning and ineffectual Fr O&#39;Connor; the wretched and destitute Rashers Tierney. In the background hovers the enormous shadow of Jim Larkin, Plunkett&#39;s real-life hero. The novel&#39;s popularity derives from its realism and its naturalistic presentation of traumatic historical events. There are clear heroes and villains. The book is informed by a sense of moral outrage at the treatment of the locked out trade unionists, the indifference and evasion of the city&#39;s clergy and middle class and the squalor and degradation of the tenement slums.</p><p>James Plunkett Kelly, or James Plunkett (21 May 1920 - 28 May 2003), Irish novelist, playwright, broadcaster. Born in 1920 in Dublin&#39;s inner city, was the son of a World War I veteran who was a member of Jim Larkin&#39;s Irish Transport and General Workers Union, which had a life-long impact on the young writer. Plunkett drew on his city centre working-class background, and his commitment to the labour movement, as the background for his fiction. Strumpet City is acknowledged as his masterpiece. His other novels include Farewell Companions, The Gems She Wore and The Circus Animals. He was an accomplished short story writer and also wrote for radio and for the theatre. During the 1960s, Plunkett worked as a producer at Telefis Eireann. He won two Jacob&#39;s Awards, in 1965 and 1969, for his TV productions. He was a member of Aosdana. President of Irish Academy of Letters.`Plunkett&#39;s seminal book provided a graphic depiction of a major event in a flawed society, which was ultimately a conflict between two sets of values - the values of the slum, interdependence and collective solidarity versus the values of the quick buck&#39; -- SIPTU President, Jack O&#39;Connor `Many studies have been written about the quest for the Great American Novel. Anyone seeking its Irish equivalent need search no further.&#39; Eileen Battersby, The Irish Times If there is one novel that bares the soul of Dublin as much as the &#39;life-in-one-day&#39;of Ulysses, it is James Plunkett&#39;s Strumpet City. -- Donal O&#39;Donoghue * RTE *</p><h2>Biggest Book of Soups &amp; Stews (Better Homes and Gardens Cooking)</h2><p><ul><li>More than 350 recipes for all seasons and reasons: casual or elegant, fast or slow-crafted, as a starter or a hearty meal.</li><li>The best ragus, stews, chilis, chowders, chilled soups, bisques, and more.</li><li>Super-fast soups, ready to serve in less than 30 minutes.</li><li>2 bonus chapters: Simmering Slow Cooker Recipes and Serve-along Breads and Salads.</li><li>Make-ahead suggestions for soups that freeze and reheat well.</li><li>More than 50 beautiful full-color photos.</li><li>Prep and cook times and nutrition information with every recipe.

The first volume of this major biography breaks new ground.<br><br>The greatest scholar-athlete-performing artist in U.S. history, Paul Robeson was one of the most compelling figures of the twentieth century.<br><br>Now his son, Paul Robeson Jr., traces the dramatic arc of his rise to fame, painting a definitive picture of Paul Robeson's formative years. His father was an escaped slave; his mother, a descendent of freedmen; and his wife, the brilliant and ambitious Eslanda Cardozo Goode. With a law degree from Columbia University; a professional football career; title roles in Eugene O'Neill's plays and in Shakespeare's Othello; and a concert career in America and Europe, Robeson dominated his era.<br><br>This unprecedented biography reveals the depth of Robeson's cultural scholarship, explores the contradictions he bridged in his personal and political life, and describes his emergence as a symbol of the anticolonial and antifascist struggles. Filled with previously unpublished photographs and source materials from the private diaries and letters of Paul and Eslanda Robeson, this is the epic story of a forerunner who now stands as one of America's greatest heroes.</p><p>"Robeson . . . lives, overwhelmingly, in the hearts and minds of the people whom he touched, the people for whom he was an example, the people who gained from him the power to perceive and the courage to resist. It is not a sentimental question. He lived in our times, we live in his. . . . It is a matter of bearing witness to that force which moved among us." &#x2013;James Baldwin<p>Paul Robeson was inarguably one of the most important figures of the twentieth century. As this unprecedented biography makes clear, the essential facts of his public life are near legendary. Actor, singer, scholar, and activist&#x2014;&#x2014; Robeson dominated his era. His father was an escaped slave; his mother, a descendent of distinguished freedmen. With a law degree from Columbia University, a professional football career, title roles in Eugene O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s plays and in Shakespeare&#x2019;s Othello, and a concert and film career in America and Europe, Robeson redefined the black male image.</p><p>But an intensely private side to Robeson is now revealed in these pages. At last, we can know the whole man. Here is the intimate story of how the preacher&#x2019;s son emerged as a force of breathtaking courage, principle, and compassion. Haunted by childhood trauma and pitted against brutal racists, he battled against his enemies and his demons with a warrior&#x2019;s heart. Although his youth spanned the Harlem Renaissance and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, he resisted politics for years. Flowering as an artist in Europe, he emerged as a fierce symbol of anticolonial and antifascist struggles around the world. This was the Paul Robeson who returned to New York as a pioneering superstar, ready to challenge America to keep its promise to his people.</p><p>The Undiscovered Paul Robeson sets out to explore the connection between the artist&#x2019;s soul and the passions that ruled it. Layering decades of personal conversations, extensive research, and rich insights with previously unpublished excerpts from the private diaries and letters of Paul and Eslanda Robeson, Paul Robeson, Jr., gives us a deeply felt and brilliantly conceived portrait of his father&#x2019;s defining struggles, triumphs, and humanity.</p>PAUL ROBESON, Jr., is a freelance journalist, translator, and highly regarded lecturer on American and Russian history. He served as a personal aide to his father for over twenty years and has been a civil rights activist since the 1940s. He is the owner and archivist of the Paul Robeson and Eslanda Robeson Collection, which consists of over 50,000 items, including thousands of photographs and hundreds of audio recordings.</p><h2>The Sociology of Health, Healing, and Illness (8th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>A comprehensive presentation of the major topics in medical sociology.</i> </b> </p> <p> <br> <i>The Sociology of Health, Healing, and Illness, </i>8/e by Gregory L.

It explores the impact of controls on prices and productivity, side-effects such as the growth of black markets and the expansion of government, and the relationship between controls and monetary policy. The central conclusion is that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, there are situations where the net effect of controls can be positive. In particular, temporary controls may reduce the unemployment and lost output usually associated with disinflation.</p><p>Explores the use and impact of price controls in the United States from colonial times to the end of Richard Nixon&#39;s term in the 1970s. Professor Rockoff concludes that price controls may have positive effects in the short run.</p><h2>National Geographic Atlas of the World.</h2><p>National Geographic&#39;s Definitive World Atlas, 1981.</p><p>When National Geographic published its first <i>Atlas of the World</i> more than 35 years ago, the world was indeed a different place. In order to cover today's world--including its oceans, stars, climate, natural resources, and more--National Geographic has published its seventh edition of the <i>Atlas of the World</i>. With each new edition, National Geographic strives to make its atlas more than just maps. You'll learn that the coldest place in the world is the Plateau Station in Antarctica, where the average daily temperature is minus 56.7 degrees Celsius; the most populated continent is Asia, with more than 3.6 billion people, or 60.8 percent of the world's population; the driest place on earth is the Atacama Desert in Chile; a flight from New Delhi to Rio de Janeiro covers 14,080 kilometers; life expectancy in the Republic of Zambia is 37 years; and the literacy rate in Turkmenistan is 98 percent.<p> Flip through the pages of this impressive book and you will feel as though the world is literally at your fingertips. Full-page spreads are devoted to more than 75 political and physical maps (political maps show borders; physical maps show mountains, water, valleys, and vegetation). There are many new touches to be found in this edition, including increased usage of satellite images, an especially helpful feature when researching the most remote regions of the earth; more than 50 updated political maps that record the impact of wars, revolutions, treaties, elections, and other events; and the use of the latest research on topics such as tectonics, oceanography, climate, and natural resources. The sheer size of the atlas's index--134 pages--offers insight into just how much information is packed into 260-plus pages. The book is so physically large, in fact, that when it's open, the reader is staring at three square feet of information, a surface area larger than many television screens. The potential uses of this book for a family are vast, from settling a friendly argument to completing a school report. In the end, though, the atlas is still mostly about maps. Pages and pages of maps. Maps that force us to see how wonderful and dynamic our world is. Maps that remind us of where we've been and where we'd still like to go. <i>--John Russell</i></p>*Starred Review* The National Geographic Society (NGS) is celebrating its ninetieth year of mapmaking with the eighth edition of the <i>Atlas of the World</i>. Promotional material describes some of the differences from the seventh edition. There are 15,000 changes in the text and maps. The section on the "Human World" has new double-page spreads on "Migration," "Conflict and Terror," "Transportation and Communication," and "Health, Nutrition, and Literacy." These and other introductory topics have eye-catching maps, charts, graphs and photographs accompanied by a limited amount of text. "Transportation and Communication" clearly depicts the Internet explosion and the digital divide. Another change is a new "Cities" section with maps, fact boxes, and photographs of 51 world cities. Some maps are of the area (Philadelphia, Shanghai, Tehran); some of just the city center (Buenos Aires); and some of both (Beijing, Cairo, Tokyo). This section replaces the useful city-map section for each continent (which had many more maps of smaller cities) in the seventh edition.<p>The heart of the atlas, the maps of continents and countries, shows great cartography, the strength of NGS. As in previous editions, the Americas are first, with coverage proceeding eastward around the globe. North America is given additional coverage--22 maps for North America, 13 for Asia--since the primary readership is from the U.S and Canada. The maps are not as colorful as those in other atlases, but the number of place-names is impressive, rivaling the <i>Times Atlas of the World</i> (10th ed., Crown, 1999). All maps are double-page spreads, with the exception of four--Low Countries, Denmark, New Zealand, and New Guinea--that each have a single page. The binding is described as unique in that the atlas will open flat, but it is still tight, so some information will be lost if it is rebound.</p><p>An additional change from the previous edition is that the country information follows the map section rather than being included with each continent. The country facts are current, and there is a reference to the plate number for the country map. Other material includes updated geographic comparisons, for example, Mt. Everest increasing in height. Distances by air and temperature and rainfall for major cities are given in the metric system, which is not useful for many U.S. readers, although a conversion chart is provided. The index, with 140,000 entries, provides plate number and grid location with a descriptor for rivers, mountains, etc. </p><p>A Web site accompanies the atlas; its useful update section already has a printable patch for the new Great Sand Dunes National Park. Other features of the Web site are less useful, especially the flashy animations. The interactive maps will be of interest to student researchers.</p><p>World atlases never contain every town, lake, or mountain that a user may want to find. This atlas does not include my hometown of Worcester, N.Y., or Wahroonga, the suburb of Sydney, Australia, where my niece lived for a year. However, the <i>National Geographic Atlas of the World</i> is a major, comprehensive, current atlas that should be considered for high-school, academic, and public libraries as well as for individual purchase. It will be a mainstay of the atlas collection. <i>Christine Bulson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.
